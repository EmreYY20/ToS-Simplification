website platform called&nbsp;Gyrosco.pe and would&nbsp;love&nbsp;for you to use it.\nGyroscope requires a membership to use, and we have a few membership tiers ranging from our digital offering to track, store and analyze your data, and Gyroscope Coach, which includes a human coach and advanced nutrition tracking.\nAlmost all of our revenue comes from these paid subscriptions, which is at the

happier life.</p>\n<p>Your privacy is critically important to us.\nThe entire purpose of the service is to sync and process your information.\nThis is done on our servers, so if that is not something

create refunds.</p>Fee Changes<p>We may change our fees at any time.\nWhen applicable, we will give you advance notice of the fee changes.\nIf you don\u2019t agree with the fee changes, you can cancel

by anyone else on Gyroscope.</li>\n<li>We do not sell your data, and only make money from people paying us directly.</li>\n<li>We do automatic tracking and syncing in the background as much as possible, so you do not have to do a lot of work to maintain your account and manually enter data every day.</li>\n<li>Aggregate information may be used for research, quality assurance, and improving the Gyroscope service\u2014for example, using all of the sleep data to improve the accuracy of our automatic sleep detection (a free feature which anyone can use, by the way), or analyzing when people get sick to prevent our users from getting sick in the future.</li>\n<li>Connecting a 3rd party service gives us access to that data, but does not send your Gyroscope info to them.\nIt is a one way connection.\nFor example, if you connect Facebook, that gives us access to sync your profile photo and basic info, but does not give Facebook access to any of your Gyroscope data.\nWith this in mind, we recommend people use Facebook login for the most easy signup experience, and to prevent the hassle of forgotten passwords.\nThis does not reduce the privacy or security of your account in any way.</li>\n</ul>Who We Are<p>We are Gyroscope Innovations, Inc.\n(collectively referred to herein as \"Gyroscope,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\").\nWe provide Internet and mobile app-based services including, for example, the apps listed below (\"Mobile Apps\" or \"Apps\"):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gyroscope Website</li>\n<li>Gyroscope iPhone App</li>\n<li>Gyroscope Android App</li>\n<li>Gyroscope Chrome Extension</li>\n<li>Gyroscope Company Dashboard</li>\n<li>Gyroscope Annual Report books</li>\n</ul>\n<p>BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU CONSENT TO THE COLLECTION, USE AND TRANSFER OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR PROCESSING IN THE UNITED STATES AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.\n</p>\n<p>In order to comply with the requirements of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for our European consumers and users, this Privacy Policy outlines the legal basis on which we process your Personal Data and provides other information required by the GDPR.</p>Information About Your Personal Data<p>This Privacy Policy relates to data about you, your devices, and your interaction with our Services.&nbsp;\u2028</p>\n<p>\"Personal Data\" is information that can be used to identify you, directly or indirectly, alone or together with other information.\nThis includes things such as your full name, email address, phone number, precise location, device IDs, certain cookie and network identifiers, and \"Fitness and Wellness Data.\"</p>\n<p>Gyroscope collects, uses, discloses and processes Personal Data as outlined in this Privacy Policy, including to operate and improve the Services and our business.\nfor advertising and marketing.\nand to provide you with innovative fitness and wellness services, as further described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;\u2028</p>\n<p>We may create aggregated, de-identified or anonymous data from Personal Data by excluding data components (such as your name, email address, or linkable tracking ID) that makes the data personally identifiable to you, through obfuscation, or through other means.\nOur use of anonymized and de-identified data is not subject to this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>How to Contact Us<p>If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about how we handle your Personal Data, then you may contact us by sending a message to support@gyrosco.pe</p>Privacy Settings<p>Within our Services there are two sharing settings: Private, and Public.\nGyroscope apps are designed for your wellness and fitness benefit.\nAs such, you are able to control what Personal Data you share and with whom you share it.</p>\n<p>Adding friends on the service will allow them to see your private profile.\nNot approving friends and keeping your account private will keep your account completely private.</p>\n<p>We encourage you to adjust the sharing settings to best meet your objectives and sharing comfort level.</p>Deleting Information and Accounts<p>You may delete your account at any time by visiting https://gyrosco.pe/delete.\nOnce deleted, your data, including your account, username, or any other related content, cannot be restored.</p>\n<p>Note that content you have shared with others (for example, through saving photos), exported from the service, or that others have copied may also remain visible after you have deleted your account or deleted the information from your own profile.\nYour public profile may be displayed in search engine results until the search engine refreshes its cache.</p>What information do we collect?<p>When you sign up for an account, we start building your profile and adding data to it.\nA basic user account has details like your name, email address, profile photo, cover photo, date of birth, and gender.\nThese can be prefilled by Facebook login, or manually entered.</p>\n<p>The Gyroscope app tracks some basic stats like steps and sleep, but it is mostly powered by the other services and devices you connect to it.\nWe have many integrations and are constantly adding more.\nWe will update this list as the data we collect evolves.\nThe more services you connect to your account, the more data you will be able to see on your profile and in the app.\nWhat you feel comfortable connecting and sharing is up to you.</p>\n<p>Each type of account has different content and various amounts of personally-identifiable information, so you may be comfortable with connecting some and not others.\nFor example, you might be comfortable connecting your public photos from Instagram, but not the locations you've been to on Foursquare.</p>\n<p>We use our access to your accounts only to load the information we need, never to write or modify your data in any way.\nFor example, if you connect your Twitter account we will never post anything on your behalf.\nIn most cases, we only ask for read-only access to your accounts.</p>\n<p>We load data once when your account is first connected, and then periodically to keep your account up to date.\nThis data is processed and stored on Gyroscope servers so it can be accessed through the website, mobile app and other platforms.\nWhen you disconnect an account, we also delete all of the associated data that was imported from that account.</p>\n<p>The following are some of the commonly used services we integrate with, and the data that can come from it.</p>Steps<p>We load your count of daily steps from a variety of sources.\nYou can select which is the primary source in settings.\nThe common sources for steps include Apple Health, Google Fit, Fitbit, Garmin, and others.</p>HealthKit<p>From the iPhone app, we load various data-points from HealthKit (aka Apple Health) during the initial install, and keep them synced occasionally throughout the day.\nWhen installing the app, you will be able to choose which data types you want to sync.\nThe possible options include: steps, workouts, sleep, heart rate, weight, bodyfat percentage, blood pressure, blood glucose, and menstrual cycles.\nPro users can also use details like calories, carbs/protein/fat intake, mindfulness time, and more if it is available in HealthKit.</p>\n<p>Setting up Gyroscope syncing will upload the data from your phone to our servers.</p>Runkeeper, Strava, Moves<p>Runs, swims, walks, biking and other types of physical activity.\nThe details we get include the start time, duration, pace, calories, etc.\nIf available, we also load the latitude/longitude coordinates to plot it on a map.\nWe also load your heart rate information if available.</p>Withings/Nokia<p>We sync with Withings to retreive bodyweight measurements taken with their wireless scales.\nWe also load blood pressure and heart rates.\nIf you use the Withings sleep tracker, we also load your sleep data.</p>Moves, Foursquare<p>We load a list of the places you've been to.\nFrom Moves, these contain Foursquare or Facebook locations and the start and end times.\nFrom Foursquare, these consist of checkins at a point in time.\nThese can contain latitude/longitude coordinates and addresses of locations.\nIf both Moves and Foursquare are connected at the same time, we prioritize the data from Moves because it has more details about the time spent\u2014for example that you were at a restaurant for an hour and a half, rather than just that you were there at a specific time of day.\nFrom Foursquare, we may also load photos that were associated with your checkins.</p>RescueTime<p>We use RescueTime to calculate your productivity for each day and show your top apps and websites.\nWe load an hourly list of what apps and websites you used.\nPages visited in incognito mode are not tracked by RescueTime and not loaded by us.\nWe understand that this data is potentially very sensitive, and only show basic averages of productivity and a few of the top apps, and not individual websites or applications.</p>Twitter<p>We connect to Twitter to load your latest shared photos.\nWe look at the favorite counts to feature the top photos you've shared on Twitter.\nWe get read-only access and never will write to your Twitter\u2014we only use it to get your latest shared content.</p>Google Fit<p>Especially for users on the Android platform, we use Google Fit to load stats like step counts and heart rate.</p>Instagram<p>Similar to Twitter, we connect to Instagram to load all of the photos you have posted.\nThis happens whether or not the Instagram account was set to private, so if you don't want to load your Instagram photos it is recommended to not connect your account.</p>23&amp;me<p>Pro members can upload an export of their 23&amp;me data, and we will load relevant reports to show in the Vault.\nThese include stats like your muscle fiber composition, lactose intolerance, and other simple traits.\nThe raw data is stored for further analysis and correlation, and tailoring your Gyroscope experience in the future.\nOnce you have added the DNA integration, you can always delete it through the website later.\nThe DNA stats are only accessible by you in the Vault, and not shared with friends or visible on your profile.\nDNA data can be deleted at any time from the Vault.</p>Manually entered data<p>In addition to the integrations, info can be manually entered into Gyroscope.</p>\n<p>Members can take a simple quiz in the app to track their mood, and also manually enter other details like symptoms, sport injuries, and blood sugar measurements or ketone levels for those on a ketogenic diet.\nThese are only for your own easy reference, and potential corellations in the future, and should not be considered medical data.</p>\n<p>Gyroscope cannot provide any medical recommendations or analysis of your medical data, and you should always consult with your doctor before making any changes to your behavior or following anything that the app may suggest.</p>\n<p>Data stored in the Vault will remain private and not be revealed to any friends.\nHowever, it may be used to find correlations or for large-scale studies in aggregate across the platform \u2014 ie.\nresearching why users get sick or how to prevent injuries.</p>Saved Cards<p>Cards from the mobile app can be added to your account via the Saved Cards feature.\nWhen saving a card to share, you can also add it to your friends feed which will make it viewable by your friends and coworkers on Gyroscope.</p>\n<p>Cards that are saved to your saved cards are part of your profile and can be viewed in the app, and by your friends.\nAn image an be removed right after it is added, or at any time later with the delete button in your highlights tab.\n</p>\n<p>Cards from all your friends can be aggregated and shown in a feed, for motivating your friends and allowing liking/commenting.\nIf you like or comment on someone's card, they may be notified about it.</p>Payments<p>We offer free and paid accounts.\nThose who upgrade to Gyroscope Track, Pro, Score, XRAY, Coach or other premium subscriptions will be charged a recurring fee, depending on the plan selected.\nDurations can range from monthly to yearly.\nRefunds will not be granted.</p>\n<p>Through the website, you can upgrade with Stripe Checkout.\nIn the app, you can upgrade with In App Purchase.\nYou get the same features, on all platforms, but are just charged in different ways.</p>\n<p>Upgrades done on the website use Stripe to store credit cards and do recurring billing.\nCredit card details are stored entirely by Stripe and not by Gyroscope.\nWe only store a token linked to that credit card, and none of your actual credit card information.\nIf you subscribed with Stripe and entered your credit card, you can manage your subscription or edit your card information from the billing page</p>\n<p>Subscriptions through iTunes can be managed through your Apple ID \u2014 Learn more about iTunes subscriptions.</p>\n<p>Subscriptions through the Google Play Store can be managed in the Google Play Store settings \u2014 Learn more about Google Play subscriptions.</p>In App Purchases with mobile app<p>Gyroscope memberships can be purchased directly with card on the website, or subscribed through the iPhone and Android apps.</p>\n<p>You can do monthly or yearly subscription, and the exact price will depend on your App Store region\u2014since the prices are converted to local currency in different places.\nIn the US, the price is $9.99/month or $69.99/year with the annual discount</p>\n<p> Payment will be charged to iTunes Account or Google Play account at confirmation of purchase.\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period.</p>\n<p>Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to iTunes or Google Play subscription settings after purchase.</p>Cookies<p>These are required to log in to your account and for basic web browsing features.\nWhen you visit the Services, a cookie will be stored on your computer.</p>Log Files<p>The Services use log files.\nStored information includes IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks.\nThis information is used to analyze trends, administer, protect and secure the Services, track member movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.\nThese files may be stored on our servers or on analytics platforms that we use.</p>Who can see your content?<p>By default, your account is set to private and you are the only one who can see your profile.\nEveryone else will see a screen with your profile photo, name, and the fact that your account is private and you must be friends to view the page.</p>\n<p>There are two simple visibility options: Private (Friends only) or Public.</p>\n<p>The default is Friends Only, and you will have no friends until you accept some requests or send requests to add people, so your account starts off as completely private.</p>\n<p>If people add you as a friend (and you accept), or you request that someone be your friend, they will be able to see your profile and all your weekly reports.\nBe careful when adding friends on Gyroscope, and only accept people that you know and trust.\nIf you do not wish to give them access to view your complete Gyroscope profile, then you should not accept their friend request.</p>\n<p>That said, some people (including everyone on the Gyroscope team) may choose to make their page completely public and transparently share it with the world.\nWe have designed most of the views Gyroscope with this in mind, to analyze and share your stats in a way that is not embarassing or dangerous.\nPublic profiles can be viewed by anyone, and may occasionally be featured on our homepage and other parts of Gyroscope.</p>\n<p>Gyroscope staff can also view your profile for testing or support purposes, but will never share anything not made public.</p>\n<p>We only use your data to power your profile page, and will never share or sell your details to any 3rd parties.\nData in your account can also be used to order print goods like posters and books for your own personal usage, which may require more access by Gyroscope staff to generate.</p>Hiding options<p>If you don\u2019t want a constant reminder of your age or weight, you can choose to hide them from settings.\nThat will put them \"out of sight &amp.\nout of mind\" but isn't intended to make them completely inaccessible.\nHiding in settings isn\u2019t a guarantee that the data is gone, but just a preference to not show it prominently and remind you about it.</p>The Vault<p>A Pro feature called the Vault gives you additional granularity over what gets shared.\nFor example, you can add friends but move your locations or weight to the Vault if you don\u2019t want them to be able to see it.\nOtherwise by default, adding friends will let them see the same view of your profile as yourself.</p>\n<p>The Vault doesn't add encryption or significantly change how the information is stored, but changes the access control to ensure that you have maximum privacy and no other members on the service can access the info.\nFrom user research, we've found that the main risk in tracking your weight or productivity is not in some russian adversary gaining access to the data, but being embarassed by it with your friends.\nThe Vault is designed to protect against these scenarios.</p>\n<p>Separate from the Vault, all users have the option to hide common things like weight and age from the account settings.\nThose are common items that people may not want to be reminded of or see on their profile, so we have made those easy to hide.</p>\n<p>The difference between hiding something or moving it to the Vault is whether you want to hide it from everyone including yourself, or just from everyone else but keep seeing it yourself.\nThe Vault also allows hiding for other data-types like location and computer usage.</p>API Access &amp.\nexporting<p>There is currently no public API to get data out of Gyroscope.\nYour account data can be exported at https://gyrosco.pe/export/</p>Your company on Gyroscope<p>If your company has a Gyroscope membership, you may be able to join your company on Gyroscope.\nJoining will give you a Pro membership, and it will also give other members in the company access to certain details from your account\u2014including things like your steps or recent workouts.\nInformation stored in the Vault or set to be hidden will still be kept private from other members.</p>GDPR DetailsHow We Collect and Use Personal Data<p>We collect your Personal Data in a number of ways and for various purposes,
