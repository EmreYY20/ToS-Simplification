<p>The Services will be provided by Us in accordance with the specifications, conditions and other information available in Our Application.</p>\n<br> Payment Methods <p>Payments for orders placed by Users must be made in cash or in installments, through the following means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All means of payment offered to the user by Google Pay and Apple Pay.</li>\n</ul>\n<br> The Right of Repentance <p>Within a period of 7 (seven) days, counted from the date of contracting the service, the customer may withdraw from the purchase and request the return of the amounts paid, without the need to present any justifications, in accordance with the Code of Defense of the Consumer (Law no.\n8.078/90).</p>\n<br> Purchase and Cancellation <p>Astribes, in addition to the Premium version, may in the future offer products and services for purchases (\u201cacquisition of new products and/or services\u201d) through the App Store, Google Play Store platforms, from which the charges will be made by the platforms payment methods authorized by Astribes.\n</p>\n<p>If the User makes a purchase of a product and/or service in the application, he must confirm his purchase with the applicable payment provider and will receive a charge according to the chosen payment method (which will be carried out through the payment platforms such as the Google Play Store or the App Store under \u201cPayment Method\u201d) the amounts assigned to the selected service(s), as well as any sales or similar taxes that may eventually apply to your payments.\n</p>\n<p>Therefore, the User authorizes Astribes, as well as the payment platforms (Google Pay or Apple Pay) to charge for purchases made by Users.\n</p>\n<br> Automatic Payment And Auto-Renewal <p>If the User purchases a periodic subscription whose renewal will be carried out automatically through an in-app purchase, the amounts will be charged continuously for the subscription until the User requests cancellation.</p>\n<p>In this way, after the period of the initial and recurring subscription commitment, your subscription will automatically continue for an additional equivalent period, for the amount that the User agreed to subscribe.\nYour card payment information will be stored on the payment platforms used by the User and later used for automatic card payments, in accordance with the terms of use of each payment platform, and the User must pay attention to the information provided by them.\n.</p>\n<p>Eventual objections regarding one or more payments made, these must be directed to the Customer Support of the payment platform chosen by the User, as well as, the User can make an objection directly with their Bank or payment provider, which may provide detailed information on procedures and rights, as well as applicable deadlines.</p>\n<p>In addition, the User may, at any time and without restrictions, withdraw their consent in relation to automatic card payments, simply by accessing the settings of the chosen payment platform, remembering that the User will still be obliged to pay any amounts that are outstanding in the system.\n</p>\n<br> Cancellation Request and Termination of the Contracted Subscription <p>Initially, it is important to clarify that the subscription cancellation policy carried out in the Application will be governed by the Consumer Protection Code (Federal Law n.\n8078, of September 11, 1990).</p>\n<p>Thus, in the event of the client's repentance, he may exercise his right of repentance within the period informed in item 14, that is, within a period of 7 (seven) days from his subscription to the service, in this way, the amounts eventually paid, in any capacity, during the reflection period, will be returned within the established deadlines and in accordance with the payment platforms Google Pay and Apple Pay.</p>\n<p>After the repentance period, if the User wishes to change or terminate his subscription, he must log in to his third-party account and follow the instructions to cancel his subscription, even if he has deleted his account with us or the Astribes app from your device.</p>\n<p>Remembering that deleting your account or the Astribes application from your device does not cause your subscription to be terminated or cancelled.\nAstribes will retain all funds debited from the selected Payment Method until the User terminates or cancels their subscription carried out by the payment platforms, as applicable.\nIf the User terminates or cancels his subscription, he may use it until the end of its current term, and it will not be renewed after that period.\n</p>\n<br> Refunds <p>Charges for purchases are non-refundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods.\nThe only plausible exception to the refund of a subscription offer if the request for cancellation of the order is made within the period of regret informed in item 14 of this term, from the date of the transaction.</p>\n<p>So, to request a refund:</p>\n<p>If the User made a purchase using the Apple Pay payment platform, he must contact the payment platform, so that the refund will be made by Apple and not by Astribes.\nTo request a refund, go to the App Store, click on your Apple ID, select \"Purchase History\", find the transaction and click \"Report a Problem\".\nYou can also submit a request to https://getsupport.apple.com.\n(check if the link is correct)</p>\n<p>If the User made a purchase using the Google Pay payment platform, contact customer service and have the Google Play Store order number ready (you can find this number in the order confirmation email or by connecting to Google Wallet), so the refund will be handled by the Google Play Store and not Astribes.</p>\n<p>Therefore, for all purchases made through the payment platforms listed above, Users must request a refund directly from the third-party seller with whom they made the purchase.</p>\n<br> Personal Data Protection <p>We treat Users' personal data in accordance with Federal Law n.\n13.709/2018 (General Personal Data Protection Law) and other related rules that apply to us.\nMore information on this subject can

of the request, we may request documents or other information that may help in their correct identification, in order to safeguard our rights and the rights from third parties.\n</p>\n<p>Therefore, in order to guarantee your correct identification as the holder of the personal data object of the request, it is possible that we request documents or other evidence that can prove your identity.\nIn this case, you will be informed in advance.</p> How long will your personal data be stored <p>Personal data collected by Astribes will be used and stored for the time necessary to provide the service or to achieve the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy, considering the rights of data subjects and controllers.</p>\n<p>In general, the data will be kept as long as the contractual relationship between the user and Astribes lasts.\nAt the end of the period of storage of personal data, these will be deleted from our databases or anonymized, except for the hypotheses legally provided for in article 16 of the general data protection law, namely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation by the controller;</li>\n<li>study by research body, ensuring, whenever possible, the anonymization of personal data;</li>\n<li>transfer to a third party, provided that the data processing requirements set forth in this Law are respected.\nor</li>\n<li>exclusive use of the

data.\n</p>\n<p>The storage of data collected by Astribes reflects our commitment to the security and privacy of your data.\nWe employ technical protection measures and solutions able to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity and inviolability of your data.\nIn addition, we also have security measures appropriate to the risks and control access to stored information.</p>\n<p>In this way, if the user chooses to stop using the services offered by Astribes, he may close his account, so that his profile will be invisible to other users.</p>\n<p>We emphasize that, if the user's profile remains inactive for a period of 3 years, Astribes will automatically close the user's account, without prior notification.\nUpon completion of the closure, the information made available by the user will be deleted under the terms of this Privacy Policy.\nTherefore, personal information will be deleted as per the terms below.</p>\n<p>The personal data we collect will be stored and used for the following periods of time:</p>\n<p>In a first moment, in order to protect the security of all users, users who choose to discontinue using our services, we will preserve their personal information for a period of 3 (three) months after the closure of the account, limiting it if there is 01 (one) year after its exclusion.\nSuch information must be kept in case there is a need for investigation in the event of any denouncements relating to illicit conduct.\nThe retention of information aims to guarantee the legitimate interest, as well as to institute defenses with third parties that may become victims.</p>\n<p>At the end of the period mentioned above, user data will be deleted, however, we will only keep limited information for compliance with legal determinations, specified in the following terms :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We will keep limited information and data, in case of eventual fulfillment of legal obligations under the terms of article 16 of the general data protection law and other legislation in force and, therefore, in compliance with current legislation, we will preserve limited data for the period of 05 (five) years, counted from the termination or definitive deletion of the user account.\nThis information will be kept to enforce our right of defense against any legal actions that may be filed.\n</li>\n<li>We will maintain the financial transactions related to the user, only for the relevant period for eventual disputes of transactions requested by the user.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this way, the periods informed are not longer than strictly necessary, given the purposes and legal justifications for the processing of data.</p>\n<p>It is worth mentioning that, if there is any legal or regulatory justification, the data may continue to be stored even if the purpose for which they were collected or processed has been exhausted.</p>\n<p>Once the treatment is finished, observing the provisions of this section, the data will be erased or anonymized.</p> Security measures in the processing of personal data <p>To keep your personal information safe, we use physical, electronic and managerial tools aimed at protecting your privacy.</p>\n<p>We apply these tools taking into account the nature of the personal data collected, the context and purpose of the treatment and the risks that possible violations would generate for the rights and freedoms of the holder of the data collected and processed.</p>\n<p>Among the measures we have adopted, we highlight the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only authorized persons have access to your personal data</li>\n<li>Access to your personal data is only done after the commitment of confidentiality</li>\n<li>Your personal data is stored in a safe and suitable environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this way, we employ technical and organizational measures capable of protecting personal data from unauthorized access and situations of destruction, loss, misplacement or alteration of such data.</p>\n<p>The measures we use take into account the nature of the data, the context and purpose of the treatment, the risks that an eventual violation would generate for the rights and freedoms of the user, and the standards currently used in the market by companies similar to ours .</p>\n<p>And yet, in addition to the security measures listed above, we also adopt other means of security management informed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The data of our users is stored in a secure environment;</li>\n<li>We limit access to our users' data, so that unauthorized third parties cannot access them;</li>\n<li>We use an SSL (Secure Socket Layer) certificate, so that data transmission between user devices and our servers is encrypted;</li>\n<li>We keep records of all those who have, in some way, contact with our data.</li>\n<li>We use several advanced defensive and preventive security techniques in our environments, such as balancing servers, segregation of environments, firewalls, WAF's, among others.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although we do everything in our power to avoid security incidents, it is possible that a problem occurs exclusively motivated by a third party - as in the case of hacker or cracker attacks or, even, in case of exclusive fault of the user, which occurs, for example, when he himself transfers his data to a third party.\nThus, although we are, in general, responsible for the personal data we process, we exempt ourselves from responsibility in the event of an exceptional situation such as these, over which we have no control.</p>\n<p>In any case, in case of security incidents that could generate risk or relevant damage for you or any of our users/customers, we will inform those affected and the National Data Protection Authority about what happened, in line with the provisions of the General Data Protection Act.</p> Complaint to a control authority <p>Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, holders of personal data who feel, in any way, aggrieved, may submit a complaint to the National Data Protection Authority.</p> Changes to this policy <p>This version of this Privacy Policy was last updated on: November 17, 2022.</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to modify, at any time, these rules, especially to adapt them to any changes made to our application, either by making new features available, or by deleting or modifying those that already exist.</p> p&gt.\n<p>Whenever there is a modification, our users will be notified about the changes.</p>\n<p>By using our services and providing your personal data after such changes, you consent to them.</p> Responsibility <p>Zilius provides for the responsibility of agents who act in data processing processes, in accordance with articles 42 to 45 of the General Data Protection Law.</p>\n<p>We are committed to keeping this Privacy Policy up to date, observing its provisions and ensuring compliance.</p>\n<p>In addition, we are also committed to seeking technical and organizational conditions that are safely able to protect the entire data processing process.</p>\n<p>If the National Data Protection Authority requires the adoption of measures in relation to the processing of data carried out by Astribes, we undertake to follow them.</p> Disclaimer <p>As mentioned in Topic 7, although we adopt high security standards to prevent incidents, no virtual page is entirely risk-free.\nIn this sense, Zillius is not responsible for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any consequences arising from the negligence, imprudence or malpractice of users in relation to their individual data.\nWe guarantee and are only responsible for the security of the data processing processes and the fulfillment of the purposes described in this instrument.\nWe emphasize that the user is responsible for the confidentiality of access data.</li>\n<li>Malicious actions by third parties, such as hacker attacks, unless proven culpable or deliberate conduct by Zillius.</li>\n<li>We emphasize that in case of security incidents that may generate risk or relevant damage to you or any of our users/customers, we will inform those affected and the National Data Protection Authority about what happened and we will comply with the necessary measures.</li>\n<li>Invalidity of the information entered by the user/customer in the records necessary for the use of Zillius services.\nany consequences arising from false information or entered in bad faith are entirely the responsibility of the user/client.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Zilius will not be held responsible for exchanges of messages
