still applies.\n<br>\n<br> (c) Opt Out: You may opt out of this arbitration agreement and class action waiver.\nIf you choose to do so, neither you nor we can force the other to arbitrate and,

federal laws of Canada applicable therein, without regard to conflict of laws principles.\nThe United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to these Terms.\n</li>\n<strong>THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS 22 AND 23 ARE APPLICABLE TO U.S.\nCONSUMERS AND, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, CONSUMERS IN ALL OTHER JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE CANADA:</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<li>\n<strong>Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.</strong> PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.\nIT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLASS ACTION.\n<br> (a) Arbitration of Disputes: For any claim, disputes, or controversy between you and us that arises out of, is related to or connected with the goods or services you acquire from or through us (individually a \"Dispute\" and collectively \"Dispute\"), you agree to first contact Dribbble Group at help@dribbble.com to attempt to resolve the Dispute informally.\nWe hope we can resolve any Dispute with you.\n<br>\n<br> In the unlikely event that you and Dribbble Group are unable to resolve the Dispute within sixty (60) days after you contact us, then you and we each agree to resolve the Dispute only by and through binding arbitration with a single arbitrator.\nYou and we further agree that the arbitration may be administered by American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA or, if an arbitration is not possible through AAA, through a similar well-recognized nationwide arbitration administration service with similar rules.\n<br>\n<br> The only exceptions to our agreement to arbitrate are as follows: (1) any and all Dispute related to injunctive relief and/or any dispute relating to the enforcement or validity of your, your licensors\u2019, our, or our licensors\u2019 Intellectual Property Rights (as discussed below).\n(b) to the extent that arbitration clauses are prohibited by applicable law in jurisdictions outside of the United States.\nor (c) a Dispute that meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court as a single-plaintiff claim (which you may bring in such a small claims court at your option).\n<br>\n<br> You agree that the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act encourages the arbitration of private disputes in an efficient manner and shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.\nThe arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.\n<br>\n<br> Notwithstanding any arbitration rules to the contrary, if your Claim is for U.S.\n$10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing.\nIf your Claim is for more than U.S.\n$10,000, at the option of either party, the arbitration will be conducted at an in-person hearing.\n<br>\n<br> We will advance the payment of filing fees and arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses, with the understanding that the arbitrator will be permitted to re-allocate those costs in the award.\n<br>\n<br> In any arbitration, the prevailing party will not seek to recover attorney\u2019s fees or expenses.\nThe award rendered by the arbitrator will be final and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nNothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that party\u2019s data security, Intellectual Property Rights, or other proprietary rights.\n<br>\n<br> (b) Class Action Waiver: YOU AND WE AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES MUST BE BROUGHT IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON\u2019S DISPUTES.\nYOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND DRIBBBLE GROUP ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.\nIf the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then those parts won\u2019t be arbitrated but will proceed in court, with the rest proceeding in arbitration.\nIf any other provision of this arbitration section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed but the rest of this section still applies.\n<br>\n<br> (c) Opt Out: You may opt out of this arbitration agreement and class action waiver.\nIf you choose to do so, neither you nor we can force the other to arbitrate and, following efforts to informally resolve any Disputes, the claim will be brought in court.\nTo opt out, you must notify us in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement.\nYour notice must include your name and address, your username and the email address you used to set up your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision, all sent to optout@dribbble.com.\nYou must also retain a copy of your opt-out notice.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Governing Law and Jurisdiction.</strong> Subject to the other terms and conditions of these Terms, you agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms that is not subject to arbitration shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California (and, to the extent controlling, the federal laws
