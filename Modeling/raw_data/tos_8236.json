otherwise agreed in writing with TasksBoard, your agreement with TasksBoard will always include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document.\nThese are referred to below as the \u201cUniversal Terms\u201d.</p>\n<p>1.3 Your agreement with TasksBoard will also include the terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the Services, in addition to the Universal Terms.\nAll of these are referred to below as the \u201cAdditional Terms\u201d.\nWhere Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that Service.</p>\n<p>1.4 The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement between you and TasksBoard in relation to your use of the Services.\nIt is important that you take the time to read them carefully.\nCollectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the \u201cTerms\u201d.</p>\n<p>1.5 If there is any contradiction between what the Additional Terms say and what the Universal Terms say, then the Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to that Service.</p>\n<p>2.\nAccepting the Terms</p>\n<p>2.1 In order to use the Services, you must firstly agree to the Terms.\nYou may not use the Services if you do not accept the Terms.</p>\n<p>2.2 You can accept the Terms by:</p>\n<p>(A) clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this

the English language versions of the Terms will govern your relationship with TasksBoard.</p>\n<p>3.2 If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the Terms says and what

around the world (\u201cSubsidiaries and Affiliates\u201d).\nSometimes, these companies will be providing the Services to you on behalf of TasksBoard itself.\nYou acknowledge and agree that

network</li>\n<li>Developing new services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can find more information about how we process personal information by referring to the privacy notices for particular services.</p>\n<p>TasksBoard&nbsp;processes personal information on GCP servers in the United States of America, in Switzerland, and in other countries.\nIn some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country.\nWe may process personal information to provide our own services.</p>\n<p>Choices for personal information</p>\n<p>When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information.\nIf we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.</p>\n<p>If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes.\nWe will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent.</p>\n<p>You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case TasksBoard&nbsp;may not be able to provide those services to you.</p>\n<p>Information sharing</p>\n<p>TasksBoard&nbsp;only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of TasksBoard&nbsp;in the following limited circumstances:</p>\n<p>We have your consent.\nWe require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.</p>\n<p>We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf.\nWe require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>\n<p>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of TasksBoard, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.</p>\n<p>If TasksBoard&nbsp;becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>\n<p>Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data.</p>\n<p>Information security</p>\n<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.\nThese include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.</p>\n<p>We restrict access to personal information to TasksBoard&nbsp;employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services.\nThese individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>\n<p>Data integrity</p>\n<p>TasksBoard&nbsp;processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice.\nWe review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services.\nWe take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.</p>\n<p>Accessing and updating personal information</p>\n<p>When you use TasksBoard&nbsp;services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes.\nWe ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required.\nIn any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.\nSome of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users' personal information.\nWe provide the details for these procedures by mail at contact@tasksboard.app.</p>\n<p>Enforcement</p>\n<p>TasksBoard&nbsp;regularly reviews its compliance with this Policy.\nPlease feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Policy or TasksBoard's treatment of personal information by contacting us through this web site or by writing to us at contact@tasksboard.app, or at&nbsp;Privacy Matters, c/o TasksBoard, WebGenesis,

will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between TasksBoard&nbsp;and an individual.</p>\n<p>Changes to this policy</p>\n<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time.\nWe will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor.\nRegardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Policy changes).\nEach version of this Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date, and we will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.</p>\n<p>If you have any additional questions or concerns about this Policy, please feel free to contact us any time through
