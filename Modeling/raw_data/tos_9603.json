value.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>General</b>\n<br>\nThe protection of personal data is taken very seriously.\nAll personal data is treated as strictly confidential and is treated according to privacy protection laws and this privacy policy.\n<br>\n<br>\nThis privacy policy explains the manner, the purpose and extent of processing personal data on our website and on associated websites, functions and content and if applicable on external websites.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe exclusively use your data for the execution of our service.\nAll data is stored and processed according to the appropriate regulations.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe explicitly point out that all data transfers on the internet (e.g.\ncommunication via e-mail) are potentially vulnerable to security flaws.\nTotal security against access by third parties is not possible.\n<br>\n<br>\nRegarding the terminology used (e.g.\n\"personal data\" or its \"processing\") we refer to die definitions specified in article 4 of the GDPR.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Controller</b>\n<br>\nThe responsible data controller can be found in the imprint of this website.\nThe controller is the natural or legal person which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data (e.g.\nnames, e-mail addresses).\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Withdrawal of consent for data processing</b>\n<br>\nSeveral data processing operations are only possibly with your explicit consent.\nWithdrawing your consent is possible at any time.\nAn informal message to us by e-mail, mail or our form is sufficient.\nThe withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Right to information, rectification, restriction and erasure</b>\n<br>\nIn accordance with current legal regulations you have the right to obtain information regarding personal data stored concerning you, their origin, recipient and the purpose of their processing at any time.\nFurthermore you have the right to rectification of your data, their restriction and their erasure.\nTo exercise these rights sending an informal message by e-mail, mail or form suffices.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority</b>\n<br>\nAs the person concerned you have the right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate supervisory authority in case of a personal data

restricted, i.e.\nyour data won't be used for other purposes.\nThis applies, for example, to personal data required to be stored because of trade or tax law.\n<br>\n<br>\nData will be stored for 6 years according to \u00a7 257(1) HGB (books of account, inventories, opening balance sheets, annual financial statements, business letters, accounting records, etc.) or for 10 years according to \u00a7 147(1) AO (accounts and records, inventories, opening balance sheets, situation reports, accounting records, trade or business letters, other documents relevant for taxation,

computer (IP address)<br>\n- time of the server query<br>\nNo consolidation of these data with data from other sources occurs.\nThe basis for the data processing is art.\n6(1)(b) GDPR which allows processing of data necessary for the performance of a contract or in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract.<br>\nFor privacy reasons this information is stored for a maximum of seven days and is deleted automatically subsequently.\nData stored to be later used as evidence are exempt from deletion until the incident has been conclusively resolved.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Transmission of data
