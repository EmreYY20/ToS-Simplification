and interaction as informative, and relevant as possible.\nWe use cookies or similar techniques to achieve this.\nWe feel that it is important that you know what cookies our website uses and for what purposes.\nThis will help to protect your privacy, while ensuring our website's user-friendliness as much as possible.\n</p> What are cookies? <br>\n<p> Cookies are small text files that are stored onto your terminal equipment (computer or mobile device) when you visit certain websites.\nAt Philips we may use similar techniques, such as pixels, web beacons, device fingerprints, etc.\nFor the sake of consistency, all these techniques combined will be hereafter referred to as \u201ccookies\u201d.\n</p> Why are cookies used? <p>\n</p>\n<p>Cookies may be used for many different purposes.\nIn the first place, cookies can be required to make the website function properly.\nFor example, without cookies it would be difficult to make a website remember that you have logged in, or which products you have put in your shopping cart.\nThese are called&nbsp;<em>required cookies</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cookies can also be used to analyse how a website is used, to count the number of visitors, to learn how the website may be improved.\nWe do not link the website usage statistics and other reports to individual people.\nThese cookies are called&nbsp;<em>analytics cookies</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly,&nbsp;<em>social media cookies</em>&nbsp;are used to enable integration of social media into the website, so that you can immediately like or share a page or product on your favourite social media service.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A fourth important use of cookies is to enable online advertising, which may be personalized to show ads that are more relevant and interesting to you, both within and beyond Philips websites.\nThis is done by&nbsp;<em>(targeted) advertising cookies</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p> How can I make choices about cookies and my privacy on Philips websites? <br>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Philips websites offer you the possibility to set your preferences regarding cookies.\nBy clicking \u2018Cookies\u2019 you can choose which types of cookies you would like our website to use.\nYou can change your preferences at any time.\nUnder Cookie Settings you can also find a list of all cookies within each category (required, analytics, social media, targeted advertising).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please note that using the Cookie Settings on our website may not result in the deletion of any cookies that have already been set.\nYou can do that via the settings of your web browser as described below, after you have changed your Cookie Settings on our website.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you are visiting a Philips website targeted at visitors outside of the EU, you may use the settings of your web browser to make choices about cookies and privacy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n</p> How to manage or disable cookies in your browser <br>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Please be aware that Philips currently does not make use of a technical solution that would enable us to respond to your browser's 'Do Not Track' signals.\nBesides using the Cookie Settings section on our website, you may manage your cookie settings in your browser settings at any time.\nPlease be aware that your browser settings may not offer you the same ease of use as the Cookie Settings on our website.\nIf you simply disable all cookies or all of our cookies in your browser settings, you may find that certain sections or features of our website(s) will not work, because your browser may prevent us from setting functionally required cookies.\nTherefore, it is recommended to use the Cookie Settings on our website instead of disabling all cookies via your web browser.&nbsp;<br>\n<br> You may find further information on how to disable cookies or manage your cookie settings for the browser that you use from the following

have listed the privacy statements of the Social Media channels that are used the most by Philips:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Facebook</li>\n<li>Google+</li>\n<li>Twitter</li>\n<li>Pinterest</li>\n<li>LinkedIn</li>\n<li>YouTube</li>\n<li>Instagram</li>\n<li>Sharethis</li>\n<li>Vimeo</li>\n<li>Tumblr</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p>

an understanding of your likely interests on the basis of your visits and surfing behaviour on the Philips websites and other third party websites..\nBased on these interests, we develop a segmented profile and then adapt the content and the advertisements on our website for various groups of customers.</p>\n<p>\n<br> Third parties that set cookies via our website may also try to find out what your interests are in this way, and this information may also be used to present you with content or advertisements that appear more likely to be of interest to you on other, non-Philips websites.\nIn this case, the information about your current website visit may be combined with information from previous visits to websites other than ours.<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Even if these cookies are not used, please note that you will be provided with advertisements on our site.\nhowever, these advertisements will not be tailored to your interests.\nThese advertisements can, for instance, be modified according to the content of the website.\nYou can compare this type of content-related Internet advertisements with advertising on television.\nIf, say, you are watching a cookery programme on TV, you will often see an advertisement about cooking products during the advert breaks while this programme is on.<br>\n<br> We may use targeted advertising cookies for:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the

have already purchased (if you have not opted out of receiving such e-mails).</li>\n<li>matching multiple devices (e.g.\nphone, tablet, laptop) to a visitor so that it can be tracked if an ad on one
