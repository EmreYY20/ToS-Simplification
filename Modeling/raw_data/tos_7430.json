data\u201d means recorded information we hold about you from which you can be identified.\nIt may include contact details, other personal information, photographs, expressions of opinion about you or indications as to our intentions about you.\n\u201cProcessing\u201d means doing anything with the data, such as accessing, disclosing, destroying, profiling or using the data in any way.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpecial category data\u201d includes information about a person\u2019s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership,

consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person\u2019s performance

and lawful</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>3.1.\nWe will usually only process your personal data where you have given your consent or where the processing is necessary to comply with our legal obligations.\nIn other cases, we may need to process your personal data for the protection of your vital interests, for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of third parties, or to comply with contractual requirements</p>\n<p>3.2.\nWe typically require the following personal data from you to enable us to comply with statutory or contractual requirements or

Software</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3.3.\nWe will only process \u201cspecial category data\u201d where a further condition is also met.\nUsually this will mean that you have given your explicit consent to the processing of such data (although there are sometimes other processing conditions that we can rely on, for example if the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims).</p>\n<p>\n<u>What are our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party?</u>\n</p>\n<p>3.4.\nWe consider that in some circumstances the processing of your personal data is

your educational establishment, including according to the terms of our Contract with your educational establishment;</p>\n<p>4.1.10.\nwhen the Software is being setup or at the start of a new academic year.\nYour educational establishment can either setup each student individually in the Software, or we can import each student\u2019s data into the Software if we are asked to do so by your educational establishment.\nIf we are asked to do so by the educational establishment, they will provide us, via a secure file transfer medium, with a spreadsheet containing each student\u2019s name

specific purposes we tell you about in this Privacy Policy and in accordance with our services contracts with your educational establishment.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Ensuring your personal data is accurate</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We will keep the personal data we store about you accurate and up to date by enabling the designated account administrator(s) from your educational establishment to update personal data through self-service features within the Software, and by providing our support to those individuals throughout the contracted services period.\nWe will take every reasonable step to erase or rectify inaccurate data without delay.\nPlease tell us, or contact the designated account administrator from your educational establishment to contact us, if your personal details change or if you become aware of any inaccuracies in the personal data we hold about you or anyone else.\nWe will contact you or the designated account administrator from your educational establishment if we become aware of any event which is likely to result in a change to your personal data.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Retaining your personal data</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We will not keep your personal data for longer than is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we process it.\nThis means that data will be destroyed or erased from our systems when it is no longer required.\nWe review all personal data which we process at the end of each school year.\nThis includes personal data relating to users of the Software and that of teachers / staff at educational establishments.\nDuring these annual reviews, the following criteria is used on the personal data stored on our systems, to determine whether this should be retained:</p>\n<p>7.1.\nDormant prospective customer data: This personal data will be deleted if more than 3 years and one day has elapsed since our last activity using the data, if they did not enter into a contract with us.\nWe keep this personal data for this time period to allow us to re-visit historic leads, opportunities and pricing information supplied to align with School Improvement Plans which are typically run on a 3 year cycle;</p>\n<p>7.2.\nCurrent customer data: This personal data is kept throughout the life-cycle of an active contract to assist with delivery of the Services.\nand</p>\n<p>7.3.\nCustomers who held a contract with us but decided not to renew: This personal data will be kept for a minimum of 6 years from the end of the last company financial year for Lexia which that contract relates to.</p>\n<p>Usually this personal data review exercise is conducted during school summer holidays by Lexia employees.\nHowever, if this review cannot be undertaken or fully completed during this period, this process will be resumed and completed as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>What rights do you have in respect of your personal data?</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You have the right to:</p>\n<p>8.1.1.\nRequest access
