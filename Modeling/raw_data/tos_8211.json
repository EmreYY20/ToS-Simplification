describes how we use and share the personal information we collect about you when you use our Platform, which includes our website (ck12.org) and related products and services (including our mobile applications).\nThis Privacy Policy also contains information about the rights and choices you have regarding your personal information.</p>\n<p>PLEASE READ OUR ENTIRE PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING OUR PLATFORM.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.\nNOTICE TO SCHOOLS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The section provides information to school districts that have entered into agreements with CK-12 Foundation (a \u201c<strong>Contracting School</strong>\u201d) regarding the use of our Platform by students of their school districts.</p>\n<p>Under our agreement with a Contracting School, we may receive and have access to personal information about its students.\nOur use of personal information about students at a Contracting School is subject to the terms of our agreement with that Contracting School.\nIn the event of a conflict with this Privacy Policy, the terms of our agreement with a Contracting School will control to the extent the conflict is directly related to the information privacy of its students.</p>\n<p>We assist Contracting Schools in responding to requests from parents and students regarding students\u2019 information privacy.\nFor students of a Contracting School and their parents, we may refer you to that Contracting School if you have questions about our information privacy practices.</p>\n<p>When students of a Contracting School create accounts on our Platform using their school-designated email addresses, we will treat such accounts as \u201cstudent records\u201d and will comply with the requirements of our agreement with the Contracting School regarding the privacy of such accounts.</p>\n<p>Students of a Contracting School may also create personal accounts on our Platform using their personal email addresses.\nUnder our agreement with a Contracting School, students\u2019 personal accounts will not be deemed part of their \u201cstudent records.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nCHILDREN\u2019S PRIVACY</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In this Privacy Policy, we refer to the following user as a <strong>\u201cchild\u201d</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A user located within the United States who is <em>known by us</em> to be under the age of 13.\nand</li>\n<li>A user located in a country outside of the United States who is <em>known by us</em> to be under the age threshold established by the applicable children\u2019s data privacy law of that country.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Children\u2019s privacy is important to us, and we do not require a child to disclose more information than necessary to participate in the Platform.\nYounger visitors should always check with their parents or guardians before entering information online.\nWe encourage families to discuss their household guidelines regarding the online sharing of personal information.\nIf we have obtained information about a child under an agreement with a Contracting School, we do not ordinarily need to obtain the parent or guardian\u2019s consent because the Contracting School has provided consent on behalf of the parent or guardian.</p>\n<p>Within the United States, we do not knowingly permit children under 13 to register on our Platform without parental consent.</p>\n<p>Outside of the United States, we take steps (as required by applicable local law) to obtain parental consent before allowing children to register on our Platform.</p>\n<p>If you are a parent or guardian of a child, you have the option to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Review the personal information we maintain about your child;</li>\n<li>Direct us to delete the personal information we maintain about your child.\nand</li>\n<li>Request that we stop collecting or using the child\u2019s personal information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Certain personal information about your child may be posted publicly, as described in more detail below.\nIf you would like to make a request about your child\u2019s personal information, or if you have any questions about how we protect children\u2019s privacy, please email support@ck12.org.\nExercising certain rights, such as deleting personal information, may result in your child not being able to use the Platform.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\nCHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may modify our Privacy Policy to reflect updates to our practices or changes in the law.\nWe will take steps to notify you of such changes by announcing them on our Platform.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nPERSONAL INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT ABOUT YOU</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Depending on how you use the Platform, we may collect personal information about you.\nFor example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are a student or teacher, we may collect your name, telephone number, email address, mailing address, birth date, profile photo, and account login information (i.e., username and password).\nWe may also collect information linked to your use of the Platform, such as server log file data and session information (which is explained in more detail below).\nIf you do not provide certain types of personal information to us, you may not be able to register or use some areas and features on the Platform (such as the FlexBook Platform\u2122).</li>\n<li>If you are the parent or guardian of a child user, we may collect your name, contact information, and other personal information we need to verify your consent.</li>\n<li>If you use the Platform without a log in, we may still collect information about the device and browser that you used to access the Platform, such as the device\u2019s IP address, browser type, operating system, ISP domain name, your referring/exit page, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</li>\n<li>If you connect your social media account to our Platform (such as by signing up with your Facebook account), we may automatically receive your social media account username, email address, gender, and profile photo (as available, depending on your social media settings).</li>\n<li>If you donate to us, we may collect from PayPal (our service provider) your name, contact information, and donation amount.\nPayPal does not share your payment card or billing information with us.</li>\n<li>If you apply for a job with CK-12 or for our Certified Educator Program, we will collect your name, contact information, professional information, and other information contained within your application.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you use the Platform, we may also collect information about your visit that does not individually identify you.\nFor example, we may gather demographic and/or other aggregate data about our users as a group.\nAlso, we may use anonymous online survey and feedback forms to gather opinions, comments, and suggestions about our Platform.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.\nHOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may use your personal information for the following purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<u>Register you:</u> If you register with us, we will use your personal information for all purposes related to your membership and your use of our Platform.\nThis may include, for example, providing administrative, maintenance and support services to your account, responding to your questions and requests, and verifying your age.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Create your profile:</u> When registering, you may (optional) provide additional information about you, such as your occupation, professional experience, education, institution/school affiliations, interests, and a profile photo.\nWe use this information pursuant to our legitimate interests in providing you a personalized experience.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Communicate with you:</u> We may use your personal information to send you both marketing and administrative communications about the CK-12 Platform.\nThese communications can include newsletters and updates about new lessons, modules, and discussion boards, this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use, notices of security incidents, and other announcements.\nCertain of these communications will be pursuant to our legitimate interests to keep you informed, while other communications may be pursuant to your consent (if we are required by law to obtain your consent).</li>\n<li>\n<u>Receive your Feedback:</u> We may use online survey and feedback forms to gather opinions, comments, and suggestions about our Platform.\nIf your personal information is included on these forms, we will collect and use it pursuant to our legitimate interests to communicate with you regarding your feedback and make changes to our services accordingly.\nIf we post your feedback on our Platform or in our communications, and your feedback includes your personal information, we will first obtain your permission.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Accept your donation:</u> If you donate to CK-12, we will use the information we receive from PayPal (our service provider) to contact you about your donation.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Process your application:</u> If you apply for a job with CK-12 or for our Certified Educator Program, we use your personal information pursuant to your request and our legitimate interests to evaluate your application and send you follow up information.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Operate and improve the Platform:</u> We use your personal information to further our interests in operating our Platform, analyze usage trends, troubleshoot problems, maintain security, personalize your experience, and improve the Platform.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Obtain parental or guardian consent:</u> If you are the parent or guardian of a child (under 13 or under 16 years old, depending on where your child is located), we may process limited personal information about you so we can fulfill our legal obligation of obtaining your consent for the child to access our Platform.\nWe may use your contact details to communicate with you about the child\u2019s account or use of Platform.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may also use your personal information for any other purpose for which we have your consent.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nWHEN WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We share your personal information outside of CK-12 with your consent, at your direction, or in the following circumstances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<u>Service providers:</u> We may share your personal information with our service providers who provide support, maintenance, or other services to us.\nWe take steps to prohibit our service providers from using your personal information for purposes outside of providing services to us.</li>\n<li>\n<u>When Required by Law:</u> We may share your personal information if doing so is required by law or, in our good faith belief, is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with legal process, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and/or Terms of Use, (iii) respond to claims that user content violates the rights of third parties.\n(iv) respond to an emergency, or protect the rights, property or safety of CK-12, our users, and/or the public.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Corporate Transaction:</u> If CK-12 is acquired by or merged with or into another entity, or if all or substantially all of our assets are transferred to another entity, your personal information may be transferred to such entity as part of the transaction.\nIf that entity has not committed to comply with this Privacy Policy, then we will give you the option to opt out of the transfer of your personal information to the successor entity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>7.\nPUBLIC DISPLAY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In certain circumstances, some of your personal information may be visible to other users of the Platform or the general public.\nFor example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your first name (or first initial), last initial, and in certain cases your profile photo will be visible to other users of our Platform and the general public.</li>\n<li>Any comments you make or post in public forums and discussion boards is automatically linked to your username and profile and may be visible to others.</li>\n<li>If you share your CK-12 stories with us, we may publish your story with your permission.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To protect the privacy of children (see the definition above), certain functionality associated with a child\u2019s account will be disabled to ensure that the child\u2019s profile information (including profile photo) will not be visible to others on our Platform.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.\nUSER CHOICES AND OPT-OUT</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We offer you choices and opportunities to opt out of certain uses of your personal information.\nIn addition, you have certain rights with regard to the personal information we collect about you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<u>Cancel your membership and remove your account.</u> You may request to cancel your

marketing, we may still send you administrative or transactional messages.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Access and correct your personal information.</u> If you are registered with us, you may log into your account to access and correct your account information.\nHowever, certain personal information (such as your name and email address) cannot be deleted without cancelling your membership and removing your

full text of the Terms of Use, available below.\nWe recognize that you come to our site to receive educational materials and not to be burdened with a long legal document.\nUnfortunately, our lawyers tell us that we really should have a long legal document that spells out all of the rules for using the CK-12 Platform and accessing all of the educational materials we provide for free.\nSo to use the CK-12 Platform you do have to agree to our Terms of Use.\nOur goal is to minimize legal and compliance costs, so we can continue to provide you free content and services.\nBut we\u2019ve created this overview in the hope that it will make your reviewing the Terms of Use a bit easier to digest once you know what is in there.\nThis summary, however, does not supersede the legally binding provisions of our Terms of Use.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>The CK-12 Platform</strong>.\nCK-12 provides a platform for teachers and students to access educational content for free to aid in teaching and learning.\nBy using the CK-12 platform, you are entering into a contract with CK-12 that governs your use of the platform and its contents.\nThere may be other agreements (like our Curriculum Materials License) that you also need to comply with.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</strong>.\nThe Terms of Use include an arbitration provision and class action waiver.\nThis means that, except for certain kinds of disputes described in the Terms of Use, all disputes arising out of your use of the CK-12 platform will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration, and you are waiving the right to a trial by a jury or to participate in any class action or representative proceeding.\nFor more information, click here.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Your Use of the CK-12 Platform</strong>.\nAs long as you comply with the Terms of Use, you are granted a limited license to use the platform and its contents for educational purposes.\nHowever, you are not permitted to resell any portion of the platform or any content provided via the platform.\nIf you give us ideas, suggestions, or feedback, we can use that information any way we want.\nFor more information, click here.\nSo please don\u2019t steal our content and use it for other purposes, including but not limited to for-profit ventures.\nAny derivative works created from our content would be subject to our Terms of Use.\nWhen in doubt about whether a proposed use is permitted, please email us at legal@ck12.org.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Other People\u2019s Copyrights (Digital Millennium Copyright Act)</strong>.\nWe respect the rights of copyright owners and expect you to do the same.\nWe comply with U.S.\ncopyright laws, including sections of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.\nIf you believe that any content on our platform infringes your copyrights, please let us know by submitting a notice according to the instructions in our DMCA Notice.\nFor more information, click here.\nIf you are proposing a remedial measure short of complete removal or disabling of access to allegedly infringing content, then please identify that in your communication as it will help us to minimize costs (e.g., if you wish to receive attribution for a posted item of content).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Our Liability Is Limited</strong>.\nBecause we offer the platform and the educational materials for free we incur lots of expenses with no revenues.\nWe therefore cap our total liability under the Terms of Use.\nWe are not responsible for any non-direct damages.\nFor more information, click here.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>We Can Change These Terms</strong>.\nThe laws, our platform, and methods of education may evolve rapidly.\nWe therefore reserve the right to change the platform and update the Terms of Use in the future.\nWe will attempt to notify you if we make updates, and you will not be able to continue using the platform without agreeing to any updated version of the Terms of Use.\nFor more information, click here.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<i>Last Updated: February 16, 2021</i>\n</p>\nLegally binding Terms of Use\n<p>Welcome, and thank you for your interest in the CK-12

expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section&nbsp;16.2 and 16.4, you and CK-12 agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration.\nArbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\nThis agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms.\nYOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CK-12 ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</li>\n<li>16.2 <b>Exceptions</b>.\nDespite the provisions of Section&nbsp;16.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court.\n(b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available.\n(c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration.\nor (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</li>\n<li>16.3 <b>Opt-Out</b>.\nIf you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section&nbsp;16 within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to CK-12 Foundation, Attention: Legal Department \u2013 Arbitration Opt-Out, 2300 Geng Rd., Suite 150, Palo Alto, CA 94303 that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Platform, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (\u201c<b>\n<u>Opt-Out Notice</u>\n</b>\u201d).\nOnce CK-12 receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section&nbsp;16 will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section&nbsp;17.2.\nThe remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.</li>\n<li>16.4 <b>Arbitrator</b>.\nAny arbitration between you and CK-12 will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201c<b>\n<u>AAA</u>\n</b>\u201d) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, \u201c<b>\n<u>AAA Rules</u>\n</b>\u201d) as modified by these Terms.\nThe AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879, or by contacting CK-12.\nThe arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.</li>\n<li>16.5 <b>Notice of Arbitration.\nProcess</b>.\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S.\nMail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (\u201c<b>\n<u>Notice of Arbitration</u>\n</b>\u201d).\nCK-12\u2019s address for Notice is: CK-12 Foundation, Attention: Legal Department, 2300 Geng Rd., Suite 150, Palo Alto, CA 94303.\nThe Notice of Arbitration must: (a)&nbsp;describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\u201c<b>\n<u>Demand</u>\n</b>\u201d).\nThe parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or CK-12 may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nAll arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or CK-12 must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIf the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by CK-12 in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, CK-12 will pay to you the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (b)&nbsp;US$10,000.</li>\n<li>16.6 <b>Fees</b>.\nIf you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, CK-12 will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.\nAny arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Santa Clara County, California, but if the claim is for US$10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing.\nor (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.\nIf the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\nIn that case, you agree to reimburse CK-12 for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits.</li>\n<li>16.7 <b>No Class Actions</b>.\nYOU AND CK-12 AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nFurther, unless both you and CK-12 agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</li>\n<li>16.8 <b>Modifications to this Arbitration Provision</b>.\nIf CK-12 makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to CK-12\u2019s address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30&nbsp;days of the change to CK-12\u2019s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with CK-12 will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.</li>\n<li>16.9 <b>Enforceability</b>.\nIf Section&nbsp;16.7 or the entirety of this Section&nbsp;16 is found to be unenforceable, or if CK-12 receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section&nbsp;16 will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section&nbsp;17.2 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Miscellaneous</b>\n<ul>\n<li>17.1 <b>General Terms</b>.\nThese Terms, together with the Privacy Policy, the DMCA Notice, the CK-12 Curriculum Materials License, and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and CK-12 regarding your use of

Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision.\nThroughout these Terms the use of the word \u201cincluding\u201d means \u201cincluding but not
