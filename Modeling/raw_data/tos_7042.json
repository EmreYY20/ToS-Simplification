you choose to use the share your record service then by selecting the relevant options you will be able to generate a secure link and a QR Code (which can be scanned by an appropriate reader) which you can share with a third party, who can then use that information (together with a passcode which you must also share with them) to access a read only copy of your medical record (or those sections of your medical record which you have chosen to share).\nFor security reasons this link will be valid for a period of 24 hours from the time it is created, after which it will no longer work and you would need to create a new link should you wish to do so.\nYou are also able to deactivate any valid link within the 24 hour sharing period at any time via the same section of the Service which you used to create the link.</p>\n<p>13.3 You are responsible for choosing to share your medical record and you must do so with all due care.\nPlease note that while you can revoke access via the share your record service at any time, while the link is live there is nothing to prevent any third party with whom you have shared the link from itself making that link available to other persons, and if they have the passcode from copying the data contained in the record or taking screenshots of the information.\nGiven the nature of the information in your record it is your responsibility to only provide the link to trusted recipients that may need access to certain details so as to be better able to provide you with care (for example, if you were abroad then you may wish to give access to a local pharmacist to enable them to check whether you have certain allergies recorded in your record).\nBy sharing your record, you acknowledge that this is done at your own
