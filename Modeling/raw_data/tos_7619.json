new data you provide to us.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Request erasure </strong>of your personal data.\nThis enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully, or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.\nNote, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts

compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Request restriction of processing </strong>of your personal data.\nThis enables

want us to erase it.\n(c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.\nor (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party.\nWe will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.\nNote that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.\nHowever, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.\nIf you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.\nWe will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol> ", "created_at": "2023-03-17 20:53:14.433633", "updated_at": "2023-03-17
