provisional relief with respect to such breach without prejudice to any such other remedies.</p>\n<p>(h) This Agreement and any agreement between Defiant and the Customer to provide Services shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Washington without regard to conflicts of laws rules.</p>\n<p>(i) Each party consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the relevant court of

effect.\nAny provision of this Agreement or any such agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree shall remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable.</p>\n<p>(l) The rights and remedies of the parties are cumulative and not alternative.\nNeither the failure nor delay by any party in exercising any right, power, or privilege, and no

be resolved by binding arbitration by a single neutral arbitrator, provided, however, you and the Company are not precluded from asserting in small claims court any Dispute that is eligible to be brought in small claims court.\nBY AGREEING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU AND THE COMPANY ARE EACH AGREEING TO FOREGO THE ABILITY TO PURSUE DISPUTES IN COURT, OTHER THAN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO HAVE A JURY DECIDE DISPUTES.\nUnless you and the Company otherwise agree, the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) will arbitrate all disputes and the AAA\u2019s Consumer Arbitration Rules (but excluding AAA\u2019s Supplemental Rules for Class Arbitration) will apply, except to the extent the provisions of the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules are different from, conflict with, and/or are inconsistent with the terms of this Section, in which case the provisions of this Section will control and must be followed as written.\nYou and the Company each agree to only pursue Disputes on an individual basis and will not pursue Disputes, whether in arbitration or otherwise, on a class, consolidated, or representative basis, regardless of the application of procedural rules.\nBY AGREEING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU AND THE COMPANY ARE EACH AGREEING TO FORGO THE ABILITY TO PROCEED IN CLASS ACTIONS, CONSOLIDATED ACTIONS, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS, EITHER AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF OR MEMBER OF A CLASS.\nNotwithstanding any AAA rule to the contrary, or any other provision in arbitration rules chosen by agreement to govern the arbitration, you and the Company each agree that any challenges to the validity or enforceability of the class action waiver in this Section will be decided by a federal court or a court of competent jurisdiction, and not by an arbitrator.\nIf any court or arbitrator holds that the class action waiver in this Section is unenforceable, then the Dispute must be brought in a state or federal court, and not in arbitration.\nIf any portion of this arbitration provision other than the class action waiver will be found to be unenforceable, that portion will be severed, and the rest of this arbitration provision will remain in effect.\nA copy of the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules is available at www.adr.org/commercial and is incorporated herein by this reference as though set forth in full.\nIf you reside in the United States, you and the Company each agree that the location of the arbitration or court where the Dispute will be resolved will be Seattle, Washington if you live west of the Mississippi River, and in

will be resolved will be Seattle, Washington.\nYou and the Company each also agree that for arbitrated Disputes, the arbitrator\u2019s award will be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nAn arbitrator may award, on an individual basis, any relief authorized by law, including injunctive or declaratory relief and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\nYou and the Company each are responsible for your or its respective costs relating to the arbitration.\nYou and the Company each are responsible for your own respective costs relating to the arbitration, except that the Company will pay the arbitration administrative or filing fees, including the arbitrator fees (other than arbitrator fees up to the amount of the then-applicable fee for filing a civil action in federal court in the judicial district where you live in any Dispute where you assert a claim against the Company, unless you demonstrate to the arbitrator that you would be entitled to file that civil action in federal court without payment of the then-applicable fee).\nTo begin arbitration, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your Dispute to the address listed for the Company in this Section.\nYou may opt out of the agreement to arbitrate in this Section by mailing the Company written notice of your election to opt out at Defiant, Inc., 1700

and including your name and address, provided that the election will not be effective until it is received by the Company.\nYour election to opt-out of the agreement to arbitrate in this Section will not otherwise affect your rights and obligations under these Terms.\nYou and the Company each also agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce, so the Federal Arbitration Act, not state law, applies including with respect to any question of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration (despite the choice of governing law).\nIn accordance with the FAA, the appointed arbitrator must interpret, apply and enforce this Section as written.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Force Majeure</strong>\n<br>\nThe Company will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform or delay in performance

impossibility of the use of railways, shipping, aircraft, motor transport or other means of public or private transport.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Governing Law.\nExclusive Jurisdiction.\nVenue</strong>\n<br>\nThese Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington without reference to its conflict of laws provisions.\nIf for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts sitting in King County, Washington, for any and all disputes, claims, and actions arising from or in connection with the Service, Site, or these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Changes to These Terms</strong>\n<br>\nWe reserve the right to change these Terms at any time upon notice to you.\nWe may give notice by making the updated Terms available through the Service or by any other reasonable means.\nYou can review the most current Terms at

following address: privacy@defiant.com.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>General</strong>\n<br>\nThese Terms, together with any amendments, incorporated terms or policies, and any additional agreements you may enter into with the Company, will constitute the entire agreement between you and the Company.\nIf any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of the Terms, which will remain in full force and effect.\nSection titles are only for convenience and have no legal or contractual significance.\nNo waiver of any portion of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and the Company\u2019s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.\nA waiver will only be binding on us if it is in writing and signed by us.\nThe Company may assign these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time with or without notice to you.\nYou may not assign these Terms or assign, transfer, or sublicense your rights, if any, in the Service.\nYOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT WILL ANY CLAIM, ACTION, OR PROCEEDING BE INSTITUTED MORE THAN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE.\nThe Limitation of Liability, Indemnity, and Governing Law Sections of these Terms survive any termination.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns in regards to these Terms, please contact privacy@defiant.com.</p>", "created_at": "2023-08-23 20:20:12.106602", "updated_at":
