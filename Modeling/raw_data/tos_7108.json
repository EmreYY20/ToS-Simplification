reporting tools within&nbsp;Playground.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Recall that you are interacting with the raw model, which means we do not filter out biased or negative responses.\n(Also, you can read more about implementing our free content filter&nbsp;here.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are building an application related to social media, note that you must be approved through an App Review before&nbsp;commencing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You may demonstrate your ideas prior to approval in venues such as hackathons, conferences, meetings with investors or coworkers, etc., so long as you indicate that your application has not yet been approved for&nbsp;launch.</li>\n</ul> Content co-authored with the OpenAI API policy <p>Creators who wish to publish their first-party written content (e.g., a book, compendium of short stories) created in part with the OpenAI API are permitted to do so under the following&nbsp;conditions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The published content is attributed to your name or&nbsp;company.</li>\n<li>The role of AI in formulating the content is clearly disclosed in a way that no reader could possibly miss, and that a typical reader would find sufficiently easy to&nbsp;understand.</li>\n<li>Topics of the content do not violate OpenAI\u2019s Content Policy or Terms of Use, e.g., are not related to political campaigns, adult content, spam, hateful content, content that incites violence, or other uses that may cause social&nbsp;harm.</li>\n<li>We kindly ask that you refrain from sharing outputs that may offend&nbsp;others.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For instance, one must detail in a Foreword or Introduction (or some place similar) the relative roles of drafting, editing, etc.\nPeople should not represent API-generated content as being wholly generated by a human or wholly generated by an AI, and it is a human who must take ultimate responsibility for the content being&nbsp;published.</p>\n<p>Here is some stock language you may use to describe your creative process, provided it is&nbsp;accurate:</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cThe author generated this text in part with GPT-3, OpenAI\u2019s large-scale language-generation model.\nUpon generating draft language, the author reviewed, edited, and revised the language to their own liking and takes ultimate responsibility for the content of this&nbsp;publication.\u201d</em>\n</p> Research policy <p>We believe it is important for the broader world to be able to evaluate our research and products, especially to understand and improve potential weaknesses and safety or bias problems in our models.\nAccordingly, we welcome research publications related to the OpenAI&nbsp;API.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about research publications based on API access or would like to give us advanced notice of a publication (though not required), please email us at&nbsp;papers@openai.com.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In some cases, we may want to highlight your work internally

notice any safety or security issues with the API in the course of your research, we ask that you please submit these immediately through our Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure&nbsp;Program.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>Researcher Access&nbsp;Program</em>\n</p>\n<p>There are a number of research directions we are excited to explore with the OpenAI API.\nIf you are interested in the opportunity for subsidized access, please provide us with details about your research use case using this&nbsp;form.</p>\n<p>In particular, we consider the following to be especially important directions, though you are free to craft your own&nbsp;direction:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Alignment</strong>: How can we understand what objective, if any, a model is best understood as pursuing? How do we increase the extent to which that objective is aligned with human preferences, such as via prompt design or&nbsp;fine-tuning?</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Fairness and Representation</strong>: How should performance criteria be established for fairness and representation in language models? How can language models be improved in order to effectively support the goals of fairness and representation in specific, deployed&nbsp;contexts?</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Interdisciplinary Research</strong>: How can AI development draw on insights from other disciplines such as philosophy, cognitive science, and&nbsp;sociolinguistics?</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Interpretability / Transparency</strong>: How do these models work, mechanistically? Can we identify what concepts they\u2019re using, or extract latent knowledge from the model, make inferences about the training procedure, or predict surprising future&nbsp;behavior?</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Misuse Potential</strong>: How can systems like the API be misused? What sorts of \u2018red teaming\u2019 approaches can we develop to help us and other AI developers think about responsibly deploying technologies like&nbsp;this?</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Model Exploration</strong>: Models like those served by the API have a variety of capabilities which we have yet to explore.\nWe\u2019re excited by investigations in many areas including model limitations, linguistic properties, commonsense reasoning, and potential uses for many other&nbsp;problems.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Robustness</strong>: Generative models have uneven capability surfaces, with the potential for surprisingly strong and surprisingly weak areas of capability.\nHow robust are large generative models to \u201cnatural\u201d perturbations in the prompt, such as phrasing the same idea in different ways or with/without typos? Can we predict the kinds of domains and tasks for which large generative models are more likely to be robust (or not robust), and how does this relate to the training data? Are there techniques we can use to predict and mitigate worst-case behavior? How can robustness be measured in the context of few-shot learning (e.g.\nacross variations in prompts)? Can we train models so that they satisfy safety properties with a very high level of reliability, even under adversarial&nbsp;inputs?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note that due to a high volume of requests, it takes time for us to review these applications and not all research will be prioritized for subsidy.\nWe will only be in touch if your application is selected for&nbsp;subsidy.</p> ", "created_at":

applicable law or&nbsp;these&nbsp;Terms.</p>\n<p>(b)&nbsp;<strong>Similarity of Content</strong>.\nDue to the nature of machine learning, Output may not be unique across users and the Services may generate the same or similar output for OpenAI or a third party.\nFor example, you may provide input to a model such as \u201cWhat color is the sky?\u201d and receive output such as \u201cThe sky is blue.\u201d Other users may also ask similar questions and receive the same response.\nResponses that are requested by and generated for other users are not considered&nbsp;your&nbsp;Content.</p>\n<p>(c)&nbsp;<strong>Use of Content to Improve Services</strong>.\nWe do not use Content that you provide to or receive from our API (\u201cAPI Content\u201d) to

Non-API Content may be used to improve model performance.\nIf you do not want your Non-API Content used to improve Services, you can opt out by filling out&nbsp;this form.\nPlease note that in some cases this may limit the ability of our Services to better address your specific&nbsp;use&nbsp;case.</p>\n<p>(d) <strong>Accuracy</strong>.\nArtificial intelligence and machine learning are rapidly evolving fields of study.\nWe are constantly working to improve our Services to make them more accurate, reliable, safe and beneficial.\nGiven the probabilistic nature of machine learning, use of our Services may in some situations result in incorrect Output that does not accurately reflect real people, places, or facts.\nYou should evaluate the accuracy of any Output as appropriate for your use case, including by using human review of the Output.<br>\n</p>4.\nFees and Payments<p>(a)&nbsp;<strong>Fees and Billing</strong>.\nYou will pay all fees charged to your account (\u201cFees\u201d)

you standard fees or stop providing access to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Services.<br>\n</p>5.\nConfidentiality, Security and Data Protection<p>(a)&nbsp;<strong>Confidentiality</strong>.\nYou may be given access to Confidential Information of OpenAI, its affiliates and other third parties.\nYou may use Confidential Information only as needed to use the Services as permitted under these Terms.\nYou may not

under the circumstances, including software, specifications, and other nonpublic business information.\nConfidential Information does not include information that: (i) is or becomes generally available to the public through no fault of yours.\n(ii) you already possess without any confidentiality obligations when you received it under these Terms.\n(iii) is rightfully disclosed to you by a third party without any confidentiality obligations.\nor (iv) you independently developed without using Confidential Information.\nYou may disclose Confidential Information when required by law or the valid order of a court or other governmental authority if you give reasonable prior written notice to OpenAI and use reasonable efforts to limit the scope of disclosure, including assisting us with challenging the disclosure requirement, in each case&nbsp;where&nbsp;possible.</p>\n<p>(b)&nbsp;<strong>Security</strong>.\nYou must implement reasonable and appropriate measures designed to help secure your access to and use of the Services.\nIf you discover any vulnerabilities or breaches related to your use of the Services, you must promptly contact OpenAI and provide details of the vulnerability&nbsp;or&nbsp;breach.</p>\n<p>(c)&nbsp;<strong>Processing of Personal Data</strong>.\nIf you use the Services to process personal data, you must provide legally adequate privacy notices and obtain necessary consents for the processing of such data, and you represent to us that you are processing such data in accordance with applicable law.\nIf you will be using the OpenAI API for the processing of \u201cpersonal data\u201d as defined in the GDPR or \u201cPersonal Information\u201d as defined in CCPA, please fill out this form to request to execute our Data Processing Addendum.<br>\n</p>6.\nTerm and Termination<p>(a)&nbsp;<strong>Termination.\nSuspension</strong>.\nThese Terms take effect when you first use the Services and remain in effect until terminated.\nYou may terminate these Terms at any time for any reason by discontinuing the use of the Services and Content.\nWe may terminate these Terms for any reason by providing you at least 30 days\u2019 advance notice.\nWe may terminate these Terms immediately upon notice to you if you materially breach Sections 2 (Usage Requirements), 5 (Confidentiality, Security and Data Protection), 8 (Dispute Resolution) or 9 (General Terms), if there are changes in relationships with third party technology providers outside of our control, or to comply with law or&nbsp;government&nbsp;requests.\nWe may suspend your access to the Services if you do not comply with these Terms, if your use poses a security risk to us or any third party, or if we suspect that your use is fraudulent or could subject us or any third party to liability.</p>\n<p>(b)&nbsp;<strong>Effect on Termination</strong>.\nUpon termination, you will stop using the Services and you will promptly return or, if instructed by us, destroy any Confidential Information.\nThe sections of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination or expiration should survive, including but not limited to Sections 3&nbsp;and&nbsp;5-9.<br>\n</p>7.\nIndemnification.\nDisclaimer of Warranties.\nLimitations on Liability<p>(a)&nbsp;<strong>Indemnity</strong>.\nYou will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our affiliates, and our personnel, from and against any claims, losses, and expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) arising from or relating to your use of the Services, including your Content, products or services you develop or offer in connection with the Services, and your breach of these Terms or violation of&nbsp;applicable&nbsp;law.</p>\n<p>(b)&nbsp;<strong>Disclaimer</strong>.\nTHE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED \u201cAS IS.\u201d EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW, WE AND OUR AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES (EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE) WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES, AND DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF ANY COURSE OF DEALING OR TRADE USAGE.\nWE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ACCURATE OR ERROR FREE, OR THAT ANY CONTENT WILL BE SECURE OR NOT LOST&nbsp;OR&nbsp;ALTERED.</p>\n<p>(c)&nbsp;<strong>Limitations of Liability</strong>.&nbsp;NEITHER WE NOR ANY OF OUR AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, OR DATA OR OTHER LOSSES, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\nOUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THESE TERMS SHALL NOT EXCEED \u200b\u200bTHE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SERVICE THAT GAVE RISE TO THE CLAIM DURING THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE LIABILITY AROSE OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100).\nTHE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION APPLY ONLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY&nbsp;APPLICABLE&nbsp;LAW.<br>\n</p>8.\nDispute Resolution<p>YOU AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER&nbsp;PROVISIONS:</p>\n<p>(a)&nbsp;<strong>MANDATORY ARBITRATION</strong>.\nYou and OpenAI agree to resolve any past or present claims relating to these Terms or our Services through final and binding arbitration, except that you have the right to opt out of these arbitration terms, and future changes to these arbitration terms, by filling out this form within 30 days of agreeing to these arbitration terms or the relevant&nbsp;changes.\n</p>\n<p>(b)&nbsp;<strong>Informal Dispute Resolution</strong>.&nbsp;We would like to understand and try to address your concerns prior to formal legal action.\nBefore filing a claim against OpenAI, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by sending us notice at&nbsp;dispute-resolution@openai.com&nbsp;of your name, a description of the dispute, and the relief you seek.\nIf we are unable to resolve a dispute within 60 days, you may bring a formal proceeding.\nAny statute of limitations will be tolled during the 60-day resolution&nbsp;process.\nIf you reside in the EU, the European Commission provides for an online dispute resolution platform, which you can access at https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr.</p>\n<p>(c)&nbsp;<strong>Arbitration Forum</strong>.\nEither party may commence binding arbitration through ADR Services, an alternative dispute resolution provider.\nThe parties will pay equal shares of the arbitration fees.\nIf the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay the arbitration fees and cannot obtain a waiver, OpenAI will pay them for you.\nOpenAI will not seek its attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is&nbsp;frivolous.</p>\n<p>(d)&nbsp;<strong>Arbitration Procedures</strong>.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, video conference, or in person in San Francisco, California or at another mutually agreed location.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by a sole arbitrator by ADR Services under its then-prevailing rules.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except a California court has the authority to determine (i) the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Section 8, including the mass filing procedures below, and (ii) whether you have complied with the pre-arbitration requirements in this section.\nThe amount of any settlement offer will not be disclosed to the arbitrator by either party until after the arbitrator determines the final award, if&nbsp;any.</p>\n<p>(e).&nbsp;<strong>Exceptions</strong>.\nThis arbitration section does not require arbitration of the following claims: (i) individual claims brought in small claims court.\nand (ii) injunctive or other equitable relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services or intellectual property&nbsp;infringement.</p>\n<p>(f)&nbsp;<strong>NO CLASS ACTIONS</strong>.&nbsp;Disputes must be brought on an individual basis only, and may not be brought as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding.\nClass arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.\nIf for any reason a dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, each party knowingly and irrevocably waives any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim.\nThis does not prevent either party from participating in a class-wide settlement of&nbsp;claims.</p>\n<p>(g)&nbsp;<strong>Mass Filings</strong>.\nIf, at any time, 30 or more similar demands for arbitration are asserted against OpenAI or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities (\u201cMass Filing\u201d), ADR Services will randomly assign sequential numbers to each of the Mass Filings.\nClaims numbered 1-10 will be the \u201cInitial Test Cases\u201d and will proceed to arbitration first.\nThe arbitrators will render a final award for the Initial Test Cases within 120 days of the initial pre-hearing conference, unless the claims are resolved in advance or the parties agree to extend the deadline.\nThe parties will then have 90 days (the \u201cMediation Period\u201d) to resolve the remaining cases in mediation based on the awards from the Initial Test Cases.\nIf the parties are unable to resolve the outstanding claims during this time, the parties may choose to opt out of the arbitration process and proceed in court by providing written notice to the other party within 60 days after the Mediation Period.\nOtherwise, the remaining cases will be arbitrated in their assigned order.\nAny statute of limitations will be tolled from the time the Initial Test Cases are chosen until your case is chosen as described above.</p>\n<p>(h) <strong>Severability</strong>.\nIf any part of this Section 8 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect, except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow Mass Filing or class or representative arbitration, this Section 8 will be unenforceable in its entirety.\nNothing in this section will be deemed to waive or otherwise limit the right to seek public injunctive relief or any other non-waivable right, pending a ruling on the substance of such claim from the&nbsp;arbitrator.<br>\n</p>9.\nGeneral Terms<p>(a)&nbsp;<strong>Relationship of the Parties</strong>.\nThese Terms do not create a partnership, joint venture or agency relationship between you and OpenAI or any of OpenAI\u2019s affiliates.\nOpenAI and you are independent contractors and neither party will have the power to bind the other or to incur obligations on the other\u2019s behalf without the other party\u2019s prior&nbsp;written&nbsp;consent.</p>\n<p>(b)&nbsp;<strong>Use of Brands</strong>.\nYou may not use OpenAI\u2019s or any of its affiliates\u2019 names, logos, or trademarks, without our prior&nbsp;written&nbsp;consent.</p>\n<p>(c)&nbsp;<strong>U.S.\nFederal Agency Entities</strong>.&nbsp;The Services were developed solely at

may not be used in or for the benefit of, exported, or re-exported (a) into any U.S.\nembargoed countries (collectively, the \u201cEmbargoed Countries\u201d) or (b) to anyone on the U.S.\nTreasury
