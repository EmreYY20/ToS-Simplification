exercise any of your other rights).\nThis is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.\nWe may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>\nTime limit to respond\n<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.\nOccasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests.\nIn this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>\nLAWFUL BASIS\n<p>\n<strong>Legitimate Interest:</strong> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience.\nWe make sure

it.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Request correction </strong>of the personal data that we hold about you.\nThis enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Request erasure </strong>of your personal data.\nThis enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to

may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Request restriction of processing </strong>of your

the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.\n(c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.\nor (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Request the transfer </strong>of your personal data to you or to a third party.\nWe will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.\nNote that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Withdraw consent at any time </strong>where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.\nHowever, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.\nIf you withdraw your consent, we may
