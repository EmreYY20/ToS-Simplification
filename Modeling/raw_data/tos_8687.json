by its users.\nThis content comes in the form of sentences pairs (a sentence plus its own translation), referred to as <b>\n<i>\"segments\"</i>\n</b>, each one tagged with the language names, author name (if provided), dates and other metadata.\n</p> Privacy policy Definition of public, private and personal data <p> We will refer as <b>\n<i>\"Public Data\"</i>\n</b> (or \"Public Contributions\") to all the segments contributed to the archive of translations made by users that were not explicitly marked as private.\nWe will refer as <b>\n<i>\"Private Data\"</i>\n</b> (or \"Private

tracking data and send cookies in order to provide a better user experience during your visit.<br> We may collect information such as IP address, visiting time, duration, etc.\nfor internal logging

sell or transfer \"Personal Data\" to third parties without users' express consent.<br>\n<br> We will not use \"Private Contributions\" to provide translation memory matches to other MyMemory's users and we will not publish these contributions on MyMemory\u2019s public archives.<br> The contributions to the archive, whether they are \"Public Data\" or \"Private Data\", are collected, processed and used by Translated to create statistics, set up new services and improve existing ones.<br>\n<br> We agree that \"Private Contributions\" made against the \"Public Data\" archive for a mistake by the user or a software bug by our part will be took off as soon as possible by us in reasonable time periods after a reasonable communication by the end user (in other words, vague requests from unknown users such as \"delete all my segments now\" without any other coordinates such as usernames, time periods, language pairs, keywords, etc.\nwill be disregarded).<br>\n<br> Using and contributing (editing and adding) to the \"Public Data\" archive doesn't entitle you to any right on it.\nTranslated is entitled full ownership on \"Public Data\".<br>\n</p> What information do we share with third

example.<br>\n<br> Translated can entitle its partners of a usage license over \"Public Data\" or \"Private Data\" in order to improve the quality of our and/or 3rd parties' services (eg.\nmachine translation suggestions, glossaries, language models, spell checkers...).<br>\n<br> Holders of this usage license are not entitled of any re-publishing of the raw data (entire documents or segments),

No.\n23, 00144, Rome, Italy (hereinafter, Translated) \u2014 in compliance with the requirements in Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and Council of April 27, 2016 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR) and Italian data protection law \u2014 respects and protects the privacy of users of the site referred to as the translated.com domain, putting in place every possible and proportionate effort not to harm the rights of its users.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this privacy policy is to help users understand the procedures that Translated uses in the area of privacy, including what personal data is collected, why it is collected, how it is used, how it is protected, and which individual rights users possess.</p>\n<p>This privacy policy does not apply to, and excludes our responsibility, in terms of privacy, information, or other practices of third parties, including third parties who manage websites or services to which the translated.com site refers.</p>\n<p>This privacy policy applies to all personal data that Translated acquires or processes when users interact with the translated.com website.\nExamples include: purchasing and using our services, responding to marketing communications, and contacting Translated customer service.\nThese interactions may involve visitors, clients, suppliers, and/or partners.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Translated processes personal data in areas other than the translated.com site, which require other privacy policies.</p> II.\nGeneral Information on Data Processing <p>In this privacy policy, the term \u201cpersonal data\u201d signifies information that refers to users.\nIt allows us to identify users, directly or in combination with other information in our possession.</p> Users of the Site in General <p>Translated processes user data based on consent.\nBy using or consulting Translated's site, users explicitly agree to this privacy policy and consent to the processing of their personal data in relation to the purposes and methods described below, including any disclosure to third parties, if necessary, for the provision of service.\nThe provision of data and, consequently, the consent to the gathering and processing of data is optional.\nThe user can deny consent, and may revoke consent at any time.\nHowever, denying consent may make it impossible to provide certain services and the browsing experience on the site may be compromised.</p> Clients <p>Translated shall do everything possible, consistent with the electronic form of service, to maintain the utmost confidentiality in its performance of services.\nAll texts, the nature of the work performed, the personal data of the client communicated for translation purposes, and any information transmitted by the client to Translated are subject to the strictest confidentiality and the personal data collected shall be processed in accordance with Article 6 of the GDPR.</p>\n<p>In particular, Translated shall use the information provided for the execution of the contract (and for the eventual implementation of pre-contractual measures) and such information can not \u2014 without the prior written consent of the client \u2014 be disclosed publicly or to third parties, except to its authorized employees or their authorized subcontractors, should their operational or advisory intervention require knowledge of such information.\nThe above guarantees do not apply if Translated is obliged by law to disclose such information, or in the event that such information is, or enters, in the public domain regardless of the disclosure of the same by Translated.\nThis similarly applies to cases in which the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person require the processing of personal data, or where the processing is necessary for the protection of a legitimate interest of Translated or third parties, which is of a higher nature than the rights of the data subject.</p> Suppliers and Collaborators <p>The personal data of our freelance suppliers and collaborators (suppliers, translators, interpreters, graphic designers, affiliates, consultants, etc.) shall be treated in strict confidence.\nThe only information that shall be communicated to third parties is the information published on our site, such as username, mother tongue, work experience, and studies.\nOther information such as first name, last name, date of birth, addresses, and telephone numbers shall be processed only by Translated and its authorized suppliers (i.e., accountants, banks, etc.), exclusively for the purpose of the correct execution of the employment relationship with the same and fulfillment of any legal obligations.</p> III.\nAutomatically Collected Information.\nWeb Browsing

information listed above is handled automatically and collected in an exclusively aggregated form in order to verify the correct functioning of the site, and for security reasons.\nFor the purposes of security (spam filters, firewalls, virus detection), automatically registered data may also include personal data such as IP address (the one that uniquely identifies, at least at that time, the host of origin), which could be used \u2014 in compliance with the laws in force on the subject \u2014 to block attempts to damage the site, harm other users, the carrying out of malicious activities, and activities that constitute a crime.\nThis type of data is used to protect the site and its users.</p>\n<p>The listed data is used for the sole purpose of obtaining anonymous statistical information on the use of the website and to check its correct functioning.\nConsequently, data is deleted immediately after processing.\nThe data used for security purposes (the blocking of attempts to damage the
