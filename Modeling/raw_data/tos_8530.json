follow it, and changes made to it should be discussed on the talk page.\nIn the event of any differences in meaning between the original English version and a translation, <b>the original English version takes precedence.</b>\n<br> Shortcut: <br>PP\n<p>\n<b>WikiTide values your privacy, which is one of our main priorities to maintain.</b> This Privacy Policy document covers types of information collected and recorded by WikiTide through WikiTide.org and through any other services offered by WikiTide (\"Services\"), the handling of that information, as well as rights and recourse for platform users regarding this data.\nBy using the Services, you agree and consent to this Privacy Policy.\n</p>\n<p>If you have any questions regarding our privacy practices or would like to exercise your privacy rights, please email staffwikiforge.net.\n</p> 1.\nInformation collected and how it's used\n<p>The personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information.\nWe retain User information collected indefinitely for archival, restorative, or research purposes.\nYour personal information is kept private and stored securely until a time it is no longer required or has no use.\nWe also retain individual Usage information for 180 days, after which it is deleted.\n</p>\n1.1.\nUser information\n<p>If you so choose, you may create an account on WikiTide.\nAn account is required on some wikis hosted by WikiTide in order to allow editing, viewing, or other privileges, along with some features which are reserved only for logged-in users such as requesting a wiki.\nAt the time of account creation, we collect personal information such as <b>username</b> and <b>password</b>.\nYour username will be used to identify you on our Services.\n</p>\n<p>You may also provide additional information, if you so choose it, such as your real name, pronoun preferences, or other information, in your user preferences.\nThis information will be public and labeled as such.\nYour real name may be used to attribute your Contributions.\n</p>\n<p>Please use discretion when sharing personal information in public venues on WikiTide.\nThis information may be archived or indexed by third parties and search engines and may appear in search results for search engines.\n</p>\nE-mail\n<p>If you so choose, you may link an e-mail address to your account.\nProviding an email may be required on some wikis or to use some features but will remain private unless you personally disclose it in a public venue such as a user profile page.\n</p>\n<p>WikiTide may send you emails containing WikiTide-related announcements, notices, and notifications including messages informing you of changes to our Services, new service offerings, or other information related to your use of the Services.\nYou can control what e-mails you receive through your user preferences though note that you may not opt out of e-mails related to your use of our Services (e.g.\npassword reset e-mails).\n</p>\n<p>In addition to the above, users with verified email addresses may communicate with each other.\nBy default, if you have a verified email address, other users may use a Special page (\"EmailUser\") to send messages to you and vice versa.\nWhen you use EmailUser to send a message, WikiTide will send an email to the recipient of your choice which includes your e-mail address and the content you chose to send.\nYour e-mail address is not revealed when others contact you.\nEmailUser functionality may be enabled or disabled on the Preferences page.\n</p>\n1.2.\nUsage information\n<p>WikiTide may collect certain usage information, such as the Internet protocol (IP) address, device identifier, browser type, and the date, time, and URL headers and referrer of a request.\nWikiTide may use cookies (as further described below) or other automated mechanisms to collect this information and may collect this information on an aggregate or individual basis.\nWikiTide utilizes this information for statistical purposes, to help administer, manage, and improve our Services, investigate and prevent abuse, analyze trends, and to tailor your user experience.\nWikiTide may use anonymized usage statistics derived from this information for marketing, research, or reporting purposes.\nWe respect the 'Do Not Track' header and do not collect analytics data from users who have enabled this feature on their browsers.\n</p>\n1.3.\nContributions\n<p>Making a contribution (such as an edit) through our Services (\"Contributions\") creates a public record of every piece of content added, removed, or altered by you, which WikiTide retains indefinitely.\nArticle or edit histories show when a contribution was made, as well as the username (if you are logged in) or IP address (if you are not logged in) of the person who made the edit.\nEven if an article, revision, or any other sort of contribution, is \"deleted,\" this may still be viewable by wiki operators, WikiTide personnel or vetted volunteers, or their delegates.\nAside from the rare times when WikiTide is required to delete an edit history, revision, or other contribution in response to a court order or legal process, there is no guarantee that permanent deletion will occur.\n</p>\n<p>Your Contributions may be visible to the public and may show up on search engines.\nIf you have an account registered with WikiTide, your Contributions will be attributed and associated to your username (or potentially with the \"real name\" set in your user preferences, if defined).\nIf you are not registered with WikiTide, your Contributions will be associated with your IP Address.\nPlease do not contribute anything that you are uncomfortable making permanently public, like revealing your real name or location in your contributions as this may be copied and redistributed throughout the Internet by other people.\n</p>\n1.3.1.\nPrivate wikis\n<p>Some wikis choose to restrict who can view the content on that wiki.\nWikiTide personnel and a small number of vetted volunteers have access to content on private wikis as part of their role in assisting to provide our Services.\nAccess to content on private wikis is granted or revoked by the administrators of these wikis.\nBe aware that the wiki administrators can restrict your access to Contributions you have made on a private wiki, or even make the entire wiki public content.\n</p>\n1.4.\nWikis local privacy policy\n<p>WikiTide's Privacy Policy applies to all wikis but the operators of some wikis may collect additional User information.\nWikiTide does not endorse any such additional data requests nor collect or retain it.\nAll such data collection must be described on a privacy policy page on that wiki and must be done in accordance with the law.\nIf you believe a wiki is collecting data beyond the scope of its local privacy policy or in violation of the law, please discontinue using that wiki and inform WikiTide immediately.\n</p>\n3.\nCookies\n<p>Like any other website, WikiTide uses \"cookies\".\nCookies are used to store information including visitors' preferences and logged-in status.\nCookies are not required to use WikiTide Services but may be required for some functions.\n</p>\n<p>Cookies are used for:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Accounts</b> - Logging in and using an account requires cookies in order to keep you logged in.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Analytics</b> - WikiTide collects Usage Information purely for statistical purposes though you may opt out of it by enabling your browser's \"Do Not Track\" feature.\nWhat is collected is governed as described in the section below.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Preferences</b> - Some features may utilize cookies in order to remember your preferences such as dismissing a notice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Enabling cookies does not send or disclose your personal information to third parties.\n</p>\n4.\nSharing Information with Third Parties\n<p>WikiTide is committed to privacy and will never sell your data to advertisers or share your information with third parties without your consent.\nSome individuals or organizations may have access to user or usage information in order to help us provide our Services or to maximize your experience:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Analytics</b> - WikiTide may collect, use, and share aggregated and anonymized Usage/User information and statistics derived from these with wiki administrators, users, or other third parties we may choose.\nThe analytical data does not contain personally identifiable information.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Legal reasons</b> - We may share Usage and/or User information where we believe it to be necessary in order to satisfy or comply with a valid court order, warrant, or subpoena, law or regulation, or other judicial or administrative order.\nShould your data be shared in order to comply with an aforementioned circumstance, we will notify you, via e-mail, within fourteen (14) business days unless we are either barred from doing so by court order, we believe there to be a credible risk of harm to life or limb by disclosing the request, or you do not have a verified e-mail address on your account.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Protect WikiTide and others</b> - WikiTide may use or share Usage and/or User information if it is deemed necessary in order to protect WikiTide or others from legal threats, threats of harm, or to protect ourselves, users, or others from any other sort of threat.\nWe may also disclose this information if we reasonably believe, in good faith, that it is necessary in order to detect, prevent, or otherwise assess and address potential spam, malware, fraud, abuse, unlawful activity, and security or technical concerns.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Service providers</b> - WikiTide may share User or Usage information, where required, with third-party service providers in order to provide our Services.</li>\n</ul>\n5.\nRegion-specific rights\n5.1.\nEurope - GDPR Data Protection Rights\n<p>We would like to make sure you are fully aware of all of your data protection rights.\nEvery user is entitled to the following:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>The right to access</b> \u2013 You have the right to request copies of your personal data.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>The right to rectification</b> \u2013 You have the right to request that we correct any information you believe is inaccurate.\nYou also have the right to request that we complete the information you believe is incomplete.</li>\n<li>\n<b>The right to erasure</b> \u2013 You have the right to request that we erase your personal data, under certain conditions.\nNote that Contributions made are not subject to this clause as they are governed by applicable content license contract under which you submitted the data.\nIn particular, you should be aware that most Creative Commons licenses require that attribution to the author of the content is provided.</li>\n<li>\n<b>The right to object to processing</b> \u2013 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>\n<li>\n<b>The right to data portability</b> \u2013 You have the right to request that we transfer the data that we have collected to another organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you make a request, we have <b>one (1) month</b> to respond to you.\nIf you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us.\n</p>\n6.\nChildren's Information\n<p>Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while using the internet.\nWe encourage parents and guardians to observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity.\n</p>\n<p>WikiTide does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13 nor target them.\nIf you think that your child provided this kind of information on our website, we strongly encourage you to contact us immediately and we will do our best efforts to promptly remove such information from our records.\n</p>\n7.\nNotifications\n7.1.\nSecurity breaches\n<p>Should a security breach at WikiTide occur in which your personal information is exposed, WikiTide will notify you of this and will issue a public disclosure.\nIf you have an e-mail address registered and verified with us, we will send you a notification via e-mail.\n</p>\n7.2.\nChanges to This Privacy Policy\n<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time.\nThus, we advise you to review this page periodically for any changes.\nWe will notify you of any changes by posting an announcement on our Website.\nThese changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page and your continued usage of WikiTide after an update

policy follows consensus and/or guidelines set by global functionaries.\nAll WikiTide users should follow it, and changes made to it should be discussed on the talk page.\nIn the event of any differences in meaning between the original English version and a translation, <b>the original English version takes precedence.</b>\n<br> Shortcut: <br>CP\n<p>The <b>Content Policy</b> outlines limits on the content that WikiTide is willing to host.\nWiki creators are expected to know this policy and apply it to new requests.\nWiki administrators are also expected to know this policy and are responsible for ensuring that their wikis do not fall outside the bounds of these rules.\nIf administrators repeatedly ignore or do nothing about violations of this policy, the wiki in question will be closed.\nThis policy is mainly directed to wiki leadership but ordinary editors should also make sure to also follow this policy and any local content policies that may exist on the wikis on which they edit.\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<b>NOTE:</b> Additional topic and genre-specific restrictions on requests can be found here.</i>\n</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>1.\nThe primary purpose of a wiki cannot be for commercial activity.</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>WikiTide is not a free hosting service for spam and search engine optimization (\"SEO\"), either.\nHowever, you can have limited fundraiser-type sales or provide an informational site supporting a commercial activity (for instance, a wiki describing characters from a commercial work of fiction).\n</p>\n<p>Using a third-party advertising network to display advertising is prohibited on WikiTide.\n</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>2.\nWikiTide does not host any content that is illegal in the United States.</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>This includes but is not limited to sales of various forms of contraband (ivory, fissionable material, roofies, controlled substances), incitement to violence or hatred, or underage nudity.\nWhile we expect wiki administrators to help police this, WikiTide reserves the right to delete illegal content without prior notice.\nGenerally, content will be removed by Stewards or Global Sysops if not done so by local administrators but in more severe cases, content may be removed by Site Reliability Engineers under the Terms of Use.\n</p>\n<p>Under United States Copyright Law (Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998), WikiTide must remove material reported as infringing copyright by the copyright holder, but editors or administrators may file a counter-notice if they believe the content is not, in fact, infringement.\nTo file a Takedown Request, please contact SRE by emailing sre[at]wikitide[dot]com.\n</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>3.\nWikiTide does not host wikis which spread unsubstantiated insults, hate or rumors, or promote violence or harassment against a person or group of people.</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>Content on wikis must be fairly balanced, meaningful or substantiated by independent referencing.\nWikis which have a clearly identifiable comedic or satire value are exempt from needing to substantiate claims as these provide a meaningful value in terms of relevant content.\n</p>\n<p>However, exceptions for comedy/satire do not cover language which promotes violence or hatred against people or groups of people based on factors such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, age, disability, or other marginalized groups.\nDerogatory language based on these factors is not allowed except when relevant to documenting an event, e.g.\ncontroversy about the inclusion of derogatory terms in a book.\n</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>4.\nWikiTide does not host wikis that operate on the basis of an anarchy system (i.e.\nno leadership and no rules).</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>This policy requires local administrators to help enforce it, so a wiki where there is no local leadership willing to enforce this policy and which declares to have no rules is not compatible with this policy.\n</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>5.\nWikiTide does not host wikis where the community has developed in such a way as to be characterized as toxic.</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>This may include wikis where there have been repeated personal attacks, harassment of users, 'doxing', hate speech and other Global Conduct Policy violations and where local administrators have ignored, enabled, and/or done little to stop this.\nStewards and/or Global Sysops will attempt to remediate the issue first where possible with local administrators and the community.\n</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>6.\nWikiTide does not host wikis whose primary purpose is sexual content.</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>Whether content is of a sexual nature will be determined by reference to all the circumstances and descriptions.\nContent includes written content, real images and animated or fictional images.\n</p>\n<p>Wikis which focus on fetishes that are sexual in nature are not allowed.\nThis includes written, real images and animated/fictional material.\n</p>\n<p>An exception to this rule is that wikis whose primary purpose is sexual in nature but seeks to inform or has academic value.\nFor example, a wiki dedicated to \"LGBTQ+ History\" likely covers topics that are sexual in nature but is an exception because it seeks to inform users about the history of a particular group.\n</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>7.\nWikiTide does not host wikis with the sole purpose of deceiving, defrauding, or misleading people.</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>Wikis which willfully engage in deceiving, defrauding, or misleading people are prohibited.\nWikis are prohibited from engaging in disinformation, misrepresenting information purposefully to deceive and defraud, or from concealing their origin in order to mislead users on their intentions.\nWikis may not engage in impersonating any person or organization.\nMisleading claims on health which have the potential to cause serious harm to people or public health are prohibited.\nThis is not an exhaustive list of practices deemed deceptive but helps illustrate what sorts of behaviors are.\n</p>\n<p>Wikis which make it clear that their intention is not to deceive (which may include fantasy world, role-playing, etc.) would not fall into a violation of this policy.\n</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>8.\nWikiTide does not host wikis whose main purpose is to act as a file sharing service.</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>Wikis whose main purpose is to act as a file hosting or sharing service are prohibited.\nBecause WikiTide has finite resources, files on wikis should be used to upbuild the wiki.\nThis does not affect 'Commons'-type wikis that serve multiple wikis on WikiTide that are part of a group or network.\n</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>9.\nA wiki must not create problems which make it difficult for other wikis.</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>Things which have a tendency to draw unwelcome attention to the wiki farm, such as hate speech, routine denial of service attacks, excessively violent content, references to self-harm, or places in which illegal activity is discussed can create conditions that penalize other wikis, either in SEO, domain blacklisting, downtime, trust in the wiki farm, or excessive Steward or Global Sysop time usage, especially in terms of policing content.\n</p>\n<p>If we believe that your wiki proposal will hinder other wikis, we may decline your request.\nAdditionally, we may suspend your wiki if these problems occur later, though this is very rare.\n</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>10.\nDirect forks of WikiTide wikis where no attempts at mediations are made are not allowed.</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>A direct fork of <b>another WikiTide wiki</b> where little to no attempts have been made to mediate situations on the existing wiki or existing community are prohibited.\nIf mediation has been attempted and failed, contact a Steward who will be able to support the community through any follow up processes deemed necessary including but not limited to acceptance of a fork wiki as an exemption to this clause.\n</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Direct forks and forks where a substantial amount of content is copied from a Wikimedia Foundation hosted project are also not allowed.</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>Because WikiTide runs on a finite amount of space, direct forks (forks which seek to recreate and emulate a Wikimedia project by copying all of their content from there) and forks where a substantial amount of content is copied from a Wikimedia project are prohibited.\nIf you believe you have a valid reason to fork a Wikimedia project (such as to save a project which is closing), please contact a Steward who will be able to grant an exemption to this policy depending on the circumstances.\n</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Wikis with the same or a substantially similar topic to another existing WikiTide wiki are prohibited.</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>Wikis which share the same topic or have a very similar topic to another WikiTide wiki are prohibited.\nIf a wiki is found to be sharing the same topic, it may be closed.\nIf you have a valid reason to make a wiki of a similar or of the same topic, contact a Steward who will evaluate your case and grant an exemption if needed.\nNote that this not affect wikis which focus specifically on subtopics of a bigger topic.\n</p>\n<p>If a wiki in violation of this clause is slated to be closed, Stewards will provide ample notice before closing the project and will provide an XML dump of the wiki.\nStewards will evaluate each wiki on a case-by-case basis and may grant exemptions where the projects both have enough substantive content to make closing impractical and unwise, along with other grounds per Steward discretion.\n</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>11.\nA wiki's scope (as defined in the initial wiki request) must not be <i>radically and completely</i> changed without obtaining approval from Stewards.</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>Users who radically change the scope of their wiki without approval may be restricted from requesting other wikis.\n</p>\n<p>A wiki whose scope has been radically and completely changed may be closed by a Steward.\nStewards will attempt to remediate the issue first but if the new scope of a wiki violates this policy, it may be closed.\n</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>12.\nWikiTide may delete unused and empty wikis in accordance with the Dormancy Policy.</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>See Dormancy Policy for more details.\nIf necessary, you can ask for an exemption from that policy on the Stewards' noticeboard.\n</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>WikiTide is permitted to redistribute your content.</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>By hosting your wiki on WikiTide, you grant a limited, worldwide license to redistribute content from your wiki to the users you permit to access your site and to WikiTide personnel.\nThis is to ensure that WikiTide can provide service.\nCreative Commons licenses, which are commonly used on our wikis, grant more rights.\nFor more detail on content licenses, see Changing your wiki license.\n</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Wiki creators may assess requests on standards not covered in this list</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>Wiki-hosting is an evolving process, if certain genres or topics of wiki prove consistently problematic, additional limitations may be placed on new requests beyond those listed in this document.\nThis sort of deviation could take the form of topic bans insitituted by community approval.\n</p>\n<p>A full list of additional restrictions currently in effect can be found here.\n</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Public wikis are encouraged to develop their own content policy.</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>This page is a bare minimum of what WikiTide will accept on our network.\nMost wikis will want to keep their content focused on a particular topic, and may want to limit \"off-topic\" discussion to varying degrees.\nFor this reason, most wikis will want content policies more restrictive than what is presented here.\n</p>\n<p>If WikiTide suspends public access to your wiki for any reason, we will preserve your content whenever legally and technically possible.\n</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Where there is concern that a wiki is unable to meet its obligations in enforcing the Content Policy or other global policies, a wiki may be placed under a conservatorship.</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>Local administrators may petition Stewards to place their wiki under a conservatorship.\nUnder a conservatorship, Stewards (and Global Sysops, unless otherwise requested not to by Stewards) would assume joint administrative control of a wiki alongside local administrators and Stewards would seek to help the community develop in a healthy manner that allows for the community to flourish and for the local community to effectively self-govern and for leadership to enforce all global policies.\nStewards would temporarily fully assume a local role of bureaucrat (and Global Sysops, administrator) or equivalent and would consult the local community and administrators on proposed changes to local policy, practices, and convention, in order to help the wiki.\nStewards and Global Sysops would not be above local policy and would follow all local community-endorsed policies, as would any local bureaucrat or administrator.\nWhile there is no set timeframe for a conservatorship to end, it will be the goal of Stewards for it to end as soon as possible.\nStewards will determine when a local conservatorship should conclude or they may be petitioned by local administrators or the community on the Stewards' noticeboard.\nConservatorships for other circumstances may be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n</p>\n<p>Under special and mostly extraordinary circumstances, Stewards may place a wiki in a conservatorship if they believe that local leadership is unable to address global policy enforcement concerns adequately and where previous remediation efforts involving the local administrators have failed (this includes where local administrators are chronically inactive and where reaching out to them has failed).\nWhile under these circumstances, Stewards will attempt to work alongside local administrators but if they refuse to cooperate positively or engage in self-sabotage of the wiki, Stewards may disregard them in wiki administrative affairs.\n</p>\n<p>In extreme cases of uncooperative, overly hostile, and/or sabotaging behavior, Stewards (following consensus amongst them) may demote a local administrator from any extended local permission they hold.\nStewards will only do this in extreme circumstances where other remediation efforts involving the local administrator in question have failed and where demotion is a necessity to ensure project stability.\n</p> Violations of this policy\n<dl>\n<dt>There are two types of violations of this policy that can be observed</dt>\n<dd>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Individual violations</b>: A single page or a few pages may violate this policy.\nIn that case, the issue can easily be resolved by removing the violating content and if necessary warning the user(s) who added it and taking further measures if they continue adding violating content.\nThe wiki as a whole cannot be said to be violating this policy.</li>\n<li>\n<b>General (or systemic) violations</b>: If the entire scope of a wiki or a large amount of pages violate this policy, it is considered that the entire wiki is in violation of the policy.\nIn this case, local administrators must attempt to resolve the systemic issues and remove the violating content.\nIf this is not done so within a reasonable period, Stewards may close the wiki for violating this policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>Effective date of this
