collect,&nbsp;<b>share</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>use</b>&nbsp;your information.\nOur users\u2019 privacy is important to us.\nWe encourage you to read the Privacy Policy carefully prior to using our BlockSite Product and use it to make informed decisions.</p>\n<p>By using the BlockSite Product, you acknowledge that you have read and understood the terms of this Privacy Policy.\nThis Privacy Policy is part of our Terms of Use (Link: https://blocksite.co/terms) and the processing of personal data is necessary in order to provide you with the Service (as defined below).\nDefinitions herein shall have the same meaning as in our Terms of Use.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>What Information Do We Collect?</b>\n</p>\n<p>The information we collect when you use the BlockSite Product (\u201c<b>Product Data</b>\u201d) includes (i) non-identifiable information, which may be made available or gathered via a user\u2019s use of the BlockSite Product (\u201c<b>Non-Personal Information</b>\u201c).\nand (ii) individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort be used to identify an individual (\u201c<b>Personal Information</b>\u201d).&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Non-Personal Information we collect incudes technical data such as type of browser, operating system, time stamp and certain browsing data.\nIn order to&nbsp;actively avoid processing any Personal Information and to transfer solely Non-Personal Information to our servers, we make sure the browsing data, such as visited URLs, is cleaned and scrubbed on your device prior to being sent to our servers, for the purpose of removing and filtering any information that could be used to identify you.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The Personal Information we collect or save includes: (i) online identifiers such as IP address, which is hashed (irreversibly encrypted) on a daily basis, and thus is not and cannot be traced back to an individual or used in any way to identify an individual.\n(ii) unique ID, which is a random number we generate to keep track of the amount of data sets we collect.\nAlthough the unique ID does not reveal the identity of a user and is not generated based on any user personal information, it may be considered under some jurisdictions as Personal Information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you contact us for support, you will also need to provide us with your contact details so we can communicate with you to provide the support needed.\nThis is also Personal Information but we will treat this as separate from the Product Data in our

in implementing and maintaining the security of your information.\ntherefore, we have implemented technical, physical and administrative security measures to protect your information.\nIn addition, we internally limit access to your information and limit the amount of data processed and shared.\nFor example, we hash your IP address and use a randomly generated number as your unique ID, to limit the amount of Personal Information we hold about you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Product Data are stored in data servers managed by AWS.\nAWS are a well-respected global cloud provider, who help manage our data in a secure environment.\nFor more information regarding the data security provided by AWS, please see: https://aws.amazon.com/security/.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We will take the necessary steps to ensure that international transfers of personal data (including Personal Information) meet all requirements under applicable data protection laws.\nWhen personal data collected within the European Economic Area (\u201c<b>EEA</b>\u201c) is transferred outside the EEA, we will take the steps necessary to ensure that the transfer of such data provides sufficient safeguards, and you may exercise your rights, where applicable, to receive information on such transfer mechanism.\nPersonal Information transferred outside the EEA is transferred for processing by AWS on its servers in the United States, and among the Company\u2019s affiliates, in both cases pursuant to standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission.\nIf you would like to understand more about these arrangements and your rights in connection therewith, please contact our Data Protection Officer at: dpo@blocksite.co.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Minors</b>\n</p>\n<p>Children under 13 are&nbsp;<b>prohibited</b>&nbsp;from using the

additional rights, pursuant to California privacy laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201c<b>CCPA</b>\u201d).\nThe CCPA defines \u201cpersonal information\u201d as any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to a particular California resident or household, but excluding publicly available data.\nThis section does not apply to our handling of publicly available information or other personal information subject to an exemption pursuant to Section 1798.145(c)-(f) of the CCPA.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Personal Information that We Collect, Disclose, and Sell</b>\n</p>\n<p>The following list (our \u201c<b>Notice of Collection</b>\u201d) describes the categories of personal information about California residents that we collect, from the sources listed in the \u201cWhat Information Do We Collect\u201d section above.\nWe do not sell your personal information or disclose it to third parties for a business purpose.\nWe may disclose these categories of personal information to our service providers, solely for their use as necessary to perform services on our behalf.\nThe personal information collected is used according to the \u201cHow is the Product Data Used\u201d section above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Note that the term \u201csale\u201d is

certain rights under California law, which restricts certain business practices, and which gives California consumers the right to request disclosure of what personal information about you we collect, use, disclose, and sell.&nbsp.\nThis includes (a) the right to opt out of the sale (if applicable) of your personal information.\n(b) the right to request, at no charge up to twice every 12 months: (i) a copy the personal information collected from you in the preceding 12 months.\n(ii) deletion of the personal information collected from you.\n(iii) disclosure of certain information about how we handled your personal information in the prior 12 months (your \u201c<b>Right to Know</b>\u201d), including certain information on the categories of information collected, the categories of sources,

clicking&nbsp;here&nbsp;.\n(b) contacting us at dpo@blocksite.co.</p>\n<p>If you submit one of these requests, we will first try to verify your identity.\nThen, we will attempt to match the information provided in your request with personal information we have about you, if any.\nIf you have created an account on our BlockSite Product, we may ask you, as part of our identity verification process, to sign in to your account.\nWe will take further action on your request only where we are reasonably satisfied that we have verified your identity.\nWe will use&nbsp;reasonable efforts to respond to your request within forty-five days after we receive and verify it, or, if we cannot do so, then we will respond over the following forty-five day period.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The CCPA

information are subject to certain requirements imposed by the CCPA.\nIn particular: (a) A company may not discriminate against a consumer who exercised his/her rights under the CCPA, such as by denying or providing a different level or quality of services to the consumer, or by charging different prices or rates to, or imposing penalties on the consumer, unless reasonably related to the value provided by the consumer\u2019s data.</p>\n<p>Your Rights under California\u2019s Shine-the-Light Law.&nbsp.\nCalifornia\u2019s \u201cShine-the-Light\u201d law (Cal.\nCiv.\nCode \u00a7 1798.83), provides that California residents who provide certain personal information to us have the right to request and obtain from us, free of charge, information about the personal information we have shared with third parties for their own direct marketing use (if any).\nThese requests may be made once each calendar year regarding information shared with a third party in the previous calendar year.\nTo make such a request, please submit the request in writing to dpo@blocksite.co, and include in the request a statement confirming that you are a California resident.</p>\n<p>The use of
