The First Step <p>Original statement is https://osdn.net/docs-ja/Privacy_Policy (Japanese).\n</p>Privacy Policy\u00b6<p>This document describes our policies of the following OSDN Sites (individually \"Site\" and collectively \"Sites\") on the collection, use, and disclosure of users' personal information, and describes the choices available to users regarding how to update and correct their personal information.\n</p>\n<p>OSDN.net<br>\nSRAD.jp<br>\nosdn.co.jp\n</p>\n<p>We are committed to good privacy practices regarding personal data, and we aim to give the users of our Sites as much rights as possible to control their own personal information including registration information.\nUnder strict control, we safely accumulate and store personal information that we collect or submitted to us, and take appropriate preventive and corrective actions against improper access\nto, loss, destruction, falsification, and leaking of personal information.\n</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all activities or behaviors of our users during the registering and using of the Sites owned by OSDN.\nExcept as set forth within this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use Agreement, we do not release personal data about our users and visitors without their permission.\nBy proceeding to use the OSDN Services, you consent that we may process the personal data that we collect from you in

reviews), create a new account, subscribe to any of our mailing lists, or participate in certain services.\nThat could include personal information such as phone number, name, zip code, age, or

data:</strong>\n<br>\nWe may aggregate the data we collect from our users (including IP addresses, operating system, and browser software types).\nIn the course of aggregating the data, we anonymize and de-identify it so each piece of data cannot be associated with the user.\nWe may disclose Aggregated Data to advertisers to inform them the number of people who have seen and/or clicked through their advertisements.\n</p>2.\nHow we use the information we gather\u00b6<p>When faced with business necessity to transfer users' personal data to third parties including advertisers and other business partners, we require them to comply with our Privacy Policy.\nIn accordance with data security and privacy laws, we strive to implement measures designed to ensure the security of your

provided at the end of the document.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How we use Aggregated Data:</strong>\n<br>\nWe use Aggregated Data to build higher quality, more useful sites by performing statistical analysis of collective characteristics and behaviors of our users, and by measuring demographics and interests.\nWe may use statistical information based on this data for commercial purposes, such as

integrity of the Sites\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When we send certain communications such as a news letter to subscribers, we always include a link to the webpage where they can click to \"unsubscribe\".\n</p>\n<p>User names, email addresses, and information posted by other users may be publicly available on a Site when a user voluntarily and publicly discloses personal data, such as when a user posts personal data in conjunction with content subject to an open source license, uses features to send a message to another user, or as part of a message posted to a public forum.\nWe are not responsible for any consequences which may occur from the use of personal data that a user chooses to submit to public pages.\n</p>3.\nHow we share information we gather\u00b6<p>\n<strong>We may share your personal data in the following ways:</strong>\n<br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only when in accordance with the following two provisions, we may share your personal data with third party service providers that help us with our business activities such as email marketing, telemarketing, or customer service, as well as business-to-business lead buyers, data aggregation companies, and advertising networks.\n<ul>\n<li>(i) Use user\u2019s personal data only as necessary to provide these services.\n</li>\n<li>(ii)Include provisions to establish safeguard within our contracts, terms of use, and memoranda to protect the confidentiality.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We may share user\u2019s personal data with open source projects that use OSDN.net.\nThis is for the purpose of conducting smooth open-source-project operation, and open source projects are required to comply with our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\nThe followings are the two types of information that will be shared.\n<ul>\n<li>(i) Mailing lists: Regarding mailing lists managed by an open source project, the administrative rights to the list of personal email address information are granted to the manager of the open source project.\n</li>\n<li>(ii) Access analysis: We may use third party service providers to conduct access analysis on webpages managed by open source projects.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We may share with third parties Aggregated Data compiled from information collected from users of the Sites.\nAggregated Data is used as statistics, and no single person can be identified by such compiled information.\n</li>\n<li>We may share certain data from the Sites with researchers and research organizations for the purpose of supporting academic and scholarly research on open source software.\n</li>\n<li>We may disclose information submitted by users as we reasonably feel is necessary to protect our systems, servers, networks or business, and/or

respond to a government request, or comply with legal process.\nWe also reserve the right to suspend or terminate the user\u2019s use of the Sites in connection with any suspected illegal or infringing activity or if the user is in violation of our Terms of Use Agreement.\n</li>\n<li>If OSDN or any of the Sites is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale, we will notify our users of any changes made regarding personal data.\n</li>\n</ul>4.\nCookies, web beacons and similar tracking Technologies\u00b6<p>On OSDN Sites, there are pages that use technology called \"web beacons\".\nIt is a technology also known as clear GIF, in which small graphic files are used to track the accesses to certain pages.\nWith this technology, it is possible to track a specific individual, but on our Sites, we do not use it for such purpose to obtain personal data, except that we may use it as a part of the mechanism to make sure that the downloading of contents occurs at a server that is geographically close to the user.\n</p>\n<p>Certain browsers have a \"Do Not Track\" feature that allows you to tell websites or applications that you do not want to have your online activities tracked.\nPlease note that at this time our Sites generally do not respond to browser \"Do Not Track\" signals.\n</p>\n<p>We also use cookies on our Sites to provide our users with information that meets their needs.\nCookie is a data file that is sent to the browser from a site that a user visited, which could be stored in the user's environment by the browser.\nIt is user's responsibility to turn off cookies or delete existing cookies from the user\u2019s environment.\nPlease note that by opting out of cookies, you may encounter a situation where a part of or the entire OSDN Site may not function properly.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Interest-Based Advertising:</strong>\n<br>\nWe may also participate in advertising networks that use interest-based advertising methods relying on cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies.\nThis means that a user may see advertising on our Sites tailored to the user\u2019s browsing behavior, or the user may see our advertising on other websites based on their behavior on our Sites.\n</p>\n<p>Some internet browsers, websites, and mobile devices offer opt-outs for interest-based advertising.\nFor additional information, please refer to the website that you are visiting, your browser and/or your device settings, and our \"Policy and Procedures Regarding Advertisement Agents\".\nFrom the document, you can opt-out of receiving

http://www.youronlinechoices.com/\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Access Analysis:</strong>\n<br>\nOn our Sites, in order to conduct a research on the users\u2019 trends or to deliver the most relevant advertising, we acquire statistical information regarding Site usage by using third party access analysis service.\nLike the aforementioned interest-based advertising, this access analysis service uses technologies such as cookies.\nWith this access analysis tool, data obtained by advertising network may be statistically processed in conjunction with the user attribute data obtained by advertising networks, and this information does not identify any specific individual and will be treated in a form of anonymous data.\nIt will not be used for any other purposes.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third party website links &amp.\nsubdomains:</strong>\n<br>\nOn OSDN Sites, links to third party websites are provided solely as a convenience to the user.\nWhen a user

developers and end users.\n</li>\n<li>Downloads of software through third-party mirror providers.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any personal data a user provides through the use of any third party web contents,

including when users enter personal information on our web forms.\nWe follow generally accepted standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us.\n</p>\n<p>However, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.\nTherefore, we cannot guarantee that information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.\nIt is users' responsibility to protect the security of their login information, and we advise that users do not make any confidential information publicly available through our Sites.\n</p>6.\nPolls &amp.\nSweepstakes\u3000\u00b6<p>Occasionally, we may conduct sweepstakes, contests, and polls on our Sites in order to better deliver advertisements and contents and to better understand the users' needs.\n</p>\n<p>Participation in these sweepstakes or contests is completely voluntary, and a user who decides to participate may be requested to submit information which typically includes contact information.\nAny personal data that users submit in connection with these activities will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nHowever, for certain sweepstakes, we may individually

data for any other purposes.\n</p>7.\nSocial Media\u00b6<p>OSDN Sites include widgets provided by generally well-known social media, such as the Facebook \"Like\" button.\nUsing sign-in services of these social media networks, you may be able to login to OSDN Sites or post contents on social media sites either manually or automatically.\nPlease note that your interactions with these features are subject to privacy policy of the company providing it, and not by this Privacy Policy.\n</p>8.\nUsers' Rights\u00b6<p>This section describes the rights granted to users regarding their access to personal data they submit, and the choices available to them for updating, correcting, and deleting their personal data.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Access to data:</strong>\n<br>\nUpon request, OSDN will

so that it can not be associated with a specific user.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Emails for marketing purposes:</strong>\n<br>\nAt any time, users can opt-out of receiving email notifications for promotional or marketing purposes.\nPlease note that opting out of these emails will not end our transmission of important information as long as the user\u2019s account

share the information.\nSince it is not possible for users to use our Sites and services without these data transfers, we require their consent to the transfer of their personal data to Japan or countries where the third party service providers are located.\n</p>\n<p>In these cases, the user\u2019s personal information will be subject to personal information protection law that may be different from the law of the user's residential country, and in those areas the user may have less legal rights in relation to the user\u2019s personal information.\nWe treat users' personal data in

and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, OSDN or any Service thereon (or any part thereof).\nOSDN shall not be liable to any user or other third party for any such modification, suspension or discontinuance except as expressly provided herein.\n</p> 2.\nNO UNLAWFUL OR PROHIBITED USE\n<p>\nBy using the OSDN website, you warrant to OSDN that you will not use this website, or any of the content obtained from this website, for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms.\nIf you violate any of these Terms, your permission to use the OSDN website automatically terminates.\n</p> 3.\nDESCRIPTION OF SERVICE.\nNO WEB ACCESS\n<p>\nOSDN is a website owned and operated by Appirits Inc.\n, for the purpose of fostering software development and content creation under Open-Source Initiative (\"OSI\")-approved licenses or other arrangements relating to software and/or content development that may be approved by OSDN (the \"Purpose\").\nOSDN currently offers users access to a rich collection of on-line resources for Open Source software development and content creation, including various communications tools, source code control and project management tools, online forums, personalized content and branded programming through its network of properties (collectively, the \"Services\").\nTo use the Services, each user must independently obtain access to the World Wide Web, either directly or through devices that access Web-based content, and pay any and all service fees or equipment costs associated with such access.\n</p> 4.\nREGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS\n<p>\nIf required by OSDN, each user must: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information on the Service's registration form (collectively, the \"Registration Data\") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data as necessary.\nIf, after investigation, we have reasonable grounds to suspect that any user's information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we may suspend or terminate that user's account and prohibit any and all current or future use of the Services (or any portion thereof) by that user other than as expressly provided herein.\n</p>\n<p>\nEach user will receive a password and account designation upon completing the Service's registration process and is wholly responsible for maintaining the confidentiality thereof and wholly liable for all activities occurring thereunder.\nOSDN cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from a user's failure to comply with this Section, including any loss or damage arising from any user's failure to (a) immediately notify OSDN of any unauthorized use of his or her password or account or any other breach of security and (b) ensure that he or she exits from his or her account at the end of each session.\n</p>\n<p>\nOSDN handles user Registration Data in accordance with the OSDN Privacy Statement.\n</p> 5.\nCONTENT\n<p>\nAll information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages or any other materials whatsoever (collectively, \"Content\"), whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, are the sole responsibility of the person from which such Content originated.\nThis means that the user, and not OSDN, is entirely responsible for all Content that he or she uploads, posts, emails or otherwise transmits via OSDN or any Service.\nNo user shall transmit Content or otherwise conduct or participate in any activities on OSDN and/or any Service which, in the judgment of OSDN, is likely to be prohibited by law in any applicable jurisdiction, including laws governing the encryption of software, the export of technology, the transmission of obscenity or the permissible uses of intellectual property.\n</p>\n<p>\nOSDN will not pre-screen or review Content, but OSDN reserves the right to refuse or delete any Content of which it becomes aware that it reasonably deems not to fulfill the Purpose.\nIn addition, OSDN shall have the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to refuse or delete any content that it reasonably considers to violate the Terms or be
