Service shall continue in full force and effect.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>INFORMAL NEGOTIATIONS.\nTo expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to this Agreement (\u201cDispute\u201d), you and Hurdlr agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding.\nSuch informal negotiations will commence upon written notice.\nYour address for such notices is your billing address, with an email copy to the email address you have provided to Hurdlr.\nHurdlr\u2019s address for such notices is 5511 Cornish Road, Bethesda, Maryland 20814, Attention: Legal.</p>\n<p>BINDING ARBITRATION.\nIf you and Hurdlr are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, all claims arising from use of the Services (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.\nAny election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other.\nYOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL.\nThe arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the \u201cAAA Rules\u201d) of the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) and, where appropriate, the AAA\u2019s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (\u201cAAA Consumer Rules\u201d), both of which are available at the AAA website&nbsp;www.adr.org.\nYour arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules).\nIf your claim for damages does not exceed $1,000, Hurdlr will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).\nThe arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online.\nThe arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.\nThe arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Hurdlr may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>EXCEPTIONS TO ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION.\nEach party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court or to seek injunctive or other equitable relief on an individual basis in a federal or state court in San Francisco County, California with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party\u2019s intellectual property or proprietary rights.</p>\n<p>WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BE A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nYou and Hurdlr agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Dispute between Hurdlr and you individually.\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND HURDLR ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nFurther, unless both you and Hurdlr
