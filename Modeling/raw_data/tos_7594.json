personal information</strong>\n<p>We will only process your personal information where we have a legal basis to do so.\nThe legal basis will depend on the purposes for which we have collected and use

us.\nYou can withdraw your consent at any time, including by clicking on the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d link at the bottom of any marketing email we send you.<br>(b) Our legitimate business interests: Where it is necessary for us to understand our users, promote our services and operate effectively as a style and culture magazine and digital platform provided in each case that this is done in a

detail, so we can create new services and improve the profile of our brand.<br>(c) Performance of a contract with you (or in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract with you): For example, where you have purchased a product from us and we need to use your contact details and payment information in order to process your order and send the product to you.<br>(d) Compliance with

which are reasonably necessary to ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to protect your personal information and to make sure it is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy

subject to adequate safeguards in the recipient country.\nIf you are located in the UK or the EEA, you may contact us for a copy of the safeguards which we have put in place to protect your personal

with us, we will keep a record of your purchase for the period necessary for invoicing, tax and warranty purposes.\nWe may also keep a record of correspondence with you (for example if you have made a complaint) for as long as is necessary to protect us from a legal claim.<br>6.2 Where we have collected the personal information based on your consent and we have no other lawful basis to continue with that processing, if you subsequently withdraw your consent then we will delete your personal information.\nHowever, please note that where you unsubscribe from our marketing communications, we
