marks, logos and designs, as well as other works of authorship that are eligible for copyright protection (collectively termed \u201cMarks\u201d) are valuable assets that Docker needs to protect.\nDocker does not permit all uses of Docker Marks, but Docker has posted these Trademark Usage Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) to assist you in properly using our Marks in specific cases that we permit.\nThe strength of our Marks depends, in part, upon consistent and appropriate use.\nWe ask that you properly use and credit our Marks in accordance with these Guidelines.\nWe reserve the right to change these Guidelines at any time and solely at our discretion.</p>\n<p>The requirements set forth in these Guidelines are general.\nAuthorized partners and licensees may be subject to additional restrictions that are not set forth in these Guidelines.\nIf you are a partner or a licensee of Docker, please consult your agreement for specific requirements applicable to your use of our Marks.\nIn the event of a conflict between the applicable agreement and these Guidelines, the terms of the agreement will control.</p>\n<p>These Guidelines should be followed along with Docker\u2019s Terms of Service, Docker logo and marks usage,&nbsp;and all Docker\u2019s rules and policies, posted on Docker\u2019s website or otherwise.</p>\nTHE MARKS\n<p>Our Marks consist of the following registered, unregistered and/or pending trademarks, service marks and logos which are subject to change without notice: Docker, Docker \u201cMoby Dock\u201d whale logo and the stylist representations of a container, octopus, and other entities in our original works of authorship, DOCKER HUB, RUNHUB, LIBCONTAINER, LIBTRUST, LIBCHAN, LIBSWARM, LIBPACK, DOCKER SWARM, DOCKERIZE IT, CLAY and other designs, logos or marks which may be referred to in your specific license agreement or otherwise.</p>\nPROPER TRADEMARK USES\n<p>Any permitted use must not falsely imply or suggest a sponsorship or endorsement by, or a partnership or affiliation with Docker.\nWe reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to determine when this condition is met or violated.</p>\nUse as adjectives\n<p>Trademarks should be used as adjectives \u2013 not as nouns or verbs.\nAccordingly, a trademark should not be used alone.\nA trademark term should always be used with, and immediately precede, the generic noun that describes the product or component in question.\nFor example, proper use is \u201cDOCKER computer software\u201d and not \u201cthe DOCKER.\u201d</p>\nDo not use plural or possessive form\n<p>A trademark is not a noun, so a plural form should not be used.\nFor example, proper use will be \u201cDocker software\u201d instead of \u201cDocker\u2019s\u201d.\nSimilarly, the possessive form should not be used.\nFor example, proper use will be \u201cfeatures of Docker technology\u201d instead of \u201cDocker\u2019s features\u201d.\nOnly when using Docker as the name of our company, one might use the name in the possessive form.\nFor example, Docker\u2019s technology features.</p>\nDo not create composite marks\n<p>Our Marks must not appear to be part of any other marks (whether words or logos) or part of any other words that are used informally.\nOur Marks may not be used in any variations or as a design feature on your product, packaging, web page or promotional materials without obtaining prior written approval.\nSubject to the foregoing restrictions, if our Marks are used in connection with your mark, the use must be in a manner that distinguishes your mark from our Marks.\nVariations of our Marks may confuse consumers as to the source of the goods or services bearing the altered mark, and such use may infringe our trademark rights and be actionable under applicable laws.</p>\nUse of capitals\n<p>Our Marks should be written with the proper capitalization as shown in these guidelines.\nFor example: \u201cDocker\u201d.\nDocker may be written in lower case as \u2018docker\u2019 only when the use explicitly refers to command line commands.\nFor example in documentation, help text or examples of use.</p>\nUse of Logos\n<p>The Docker\u2019s registered, unregistered and pending logos, including the Docker \u201cMoby Dock\u201d whale logo, as well as other design elements such as characters and container images, may be taken only from Docker\u2019s product sheet or from Docker\u2019s service screen shot following authorization from us.\nDo not create imitations, facsimiles or reproductions of these design elements on your own.\nThe design elements may only appear with the words, logotype, graphic elements and spacing which Docker has previously approved for use and may not be modified, recombined or displayed in modified scenes, images or other artwork.</p>\nEducational and Informational Purposes\n<p>Our word Marks (but not logo marks or other graphic depictions of our Marks) may be used in an informational context to name or describe the subject matter of an educational or informational program, to refer to Docker product or technology, provided however that such use otherwise complies with these Guidelines and the following requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Docker mark is used only in a referential context or for naming Docker or to indicate compatibility, and not in a title of a program, domain name, website, product or service</li>\n<li>The use must not falsely imply or suggest a sponsorship or endorsement by, a license from, or a partnership or affiliation with Docker.</li>\n<li>Any printed or online materials relating to the program must include proper attribution statements, registration symbols such as \u00ae or \u00a9 as appropriate, and a trademark notice statement in a form that we provide or approve.</li>\n</ul>\nCompany Name Use\n<p>The Docker name is not only a trademark used to identify our products, services and technology.\nIt also serves as our company name.\nWhen using Docker as our company name, Docker may be used as a noun and no \u201c\u00ae\u201d symbol is needed.\nFor example, the following press release use will be proper: \u201cDocker\u2019s primary focus will be supporting the rapidly growing Docker ecosystem.\u201d</p>\nPROHIBITED TRADEMARK USES\n<p>Docker does not permit using any of our Marks in the following manner: as part of your own trademark.\nto identify non-Docker products, services or technology.\nin a manner likely to cause confusion between products, services or technology of Docker and those of another entity.\nin a manner that inaccurately implies that Docker sponsors or endorses or otherwise is affiliated with your own activities, products, services or technology.\nin a manner that disparages Docker or its products, services or technology.\nin connection with products, services or activities which, in our judgment, may diminish goodwill in our Marks.\nin connection with any unlawful activities or to encourage unlawful activities.</p>\nWEBSITES AND DOMAIN NAME USES\n<p>Proper use of our Marks on websites to name or accurately describe Docker\u2019s products, services or technology is permitted.\nThe use of our Marks should not be misleading or likely to cause confusion as to whether the website is sponsored by or affiliated with Docker or whether the products, services or technology are offered by Docker.\nAny principal or secondary level domain name should not be identical to or virtually identical to any of our Marks.</p>\n<p>The website owner should not register any domain name containing our Marks and should not claim any trademark or similar proprietary rights in the domain name.\nFor example, \u201cdockertech.com\u201d, \u201cDocker-group.com\u201d, \u201cMeetdocker.com\u201d are not allowed.\nAny violation of this policy may result in legal action.</p>\n<p>The website should otherwise comply with domain name registry policies and applicable laws regarding trademark infringement and dilution.</p>\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n<p>Any and all use of our Marks in connection with account names, profiles, avatars or handles on social media platforms is subject to the same guidelines set forth herein as for other uses.\nThe use of any of our Marks in an account name, profile name, as an avatar, or in a handle on social media platforms is not permitted.</p>\nTRADEMARK NOTICE STATEMENT\n<p>The website should display a legal notice or a link that contains the following legend:</p>\n<p>\u201cDocker and the Docker logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of Docker, Inc.\nin the United States and/or other countries.\nDocker, Inc.\nand other parties may also have trademark rights in other terms used herein.\u201d</p>\n<p>This legend can be modified to include only our Marks.</p>\nREQUESTS FOR PERMISSION\n<p>You may make limited fair use of our Marks in naming or referring to our products, services or technology, for example in a magazine article, without our permission, provided you follow these Guidelines.\nAll other uses are prohibited except by express written permission, requested in advance, which we may grant or deny in our sole discretion.\nTo request permission please contact Docker\u2019s Legal Department by email at legal@docker.com Docker will attempt to evaluate requests promptly.\nDocker reserves the right to refuse permission to use our Marks for any reason.</p>\nRESTRICTED USE THAT REQUIRES A TRADEMARK LICENSE PRIOR TO USE\n<p>Certain Docker source code is available under the Apache 2.0 license.\nAlthough the Apache 2.0 license permits third parties to copy and redistribute the underlying software under the terms of the license, the Apache 2.0 license does not provide any license or right to use any of the Docker Marks.\nThus, the licensee may redistribute the Docker software under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license, but may not use the Docker Marks without express written permission from Docker, Inc.\nor as expressly permitted in this Trademark Policy.</p>\nCOPYRIGHT\n<p>Use or reproduction of Docker\u2019s original works of authorship, including the Docker \u201cMoby Dock\u201d whale design and other characters or design elements of original works authored by Docker, or the preparation of derivative works that imitate these design elements or present them in new scenes, designs, images, videos or artwork, is prohibited without prior approval from Docker.\nSuch materials include, but are not limited to, content and text displayed on Docker\u2019s website, or other documentation, photographs, diagrams, videos, and images.</p>\n<p>If authorized, your use of Docker\u2019s copyrighted material must be accompanied one of the following statements, which should be prominently displayed and reference the year/s the material was created:</p>\n<p>\u201cCopyright 2013-2021&nbsp;Docker, Inc.\nAll rights reserved.\u201d</p>\n<p>or</p>\n<p>\u201c\u00a9 2013-2021&nbsp;Docker, Inc.\nAll rights reserved.\u201d</p>\nREVIEW BY DOCKER AND REMEDIES\n<p>Docker reserves the right to review all uses of our Marks by others and to conduct periodic spot checks of such use.\nUpon request from Docker, you must provide a copy of any product, packaging, screenshot, or other materials bearing our Mark.\nYou must correct any deficiencies in the use of our Marks.\nRefusal to correct such deficiencies may result in revocation of permission to use our Marks.\nFurther, any unauthorized or improper use of our Marks or works of authorship may constitute trademark infringement, unfair competition, and/or copyright infringement in violation of federal, state or international laws.\nDocker reserves the right to initiate legal action relating to any third party use of its Marks or works of authorship that Docker, in its sole discretion, deems unlawful or improper, even if such use is not expressly prohibited hereunder.\nNothing in these Guidelines is intended to waive or restrict any legal rights that Docker may have under applicable law, to grant any license, or to acquiesce in any infringing act.</p>\nQUESTIONS\n<p>For further information or guidelines regarding proper use of

and payment information that you provide to Docker may be shared by Docker with companies who work on Docker\u2019s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes

reserves the right to disable your access to the Service for any late payments.\nAny outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable upon termination of the Terms for any reason.</p>\n6.\nUser Content\n<p>\n<strong>6.1&nbsp;</strong>The Service allows you and other users to submit, post, transmit, and share content with other users, which may include, without limitation, data files, text, articles, documents, computer software or code, music, images, audiovisual works, informational materials and any user comments submitted by you and other users on or through the Service (collectively, \u201c<strong>User Content</strong>\u201d).&nbsp;For the avoidance of doubt, User Content shall not include Third Party Content (as defined in Section 9).\nYou retain all your ownership rights in your User Content.\nDocker simply displays or makes the User Content available to users of the Service and does not otherwise control the content thereof.&nbsp;Docker does not guarantee any accuracy or confidentiality with respect to any information contained in any User Content, and strongly recommends that you think carefully about what you transmit, submit or post to or through the Service.&nbsp;You understand that all information contained in User Content is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such User Content originated.&nbsp;This means that you, and not Docker, are entirely responsible for all User Content that you upload, post, transmit, or otherwise make available through the Service, as well as for any actions taken by Docker or other users as a result of such User Content.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.2&nbsp;</strong>Docker intends to, but does not guarantee that it will, display or make any User Content available on or through the Service, and Docker reserves the right to refuse to allow any User Content on the Service, or to edit or remove any User Content at any time with or without prior notice, if Docker reasonably believes that you or your User Content are in violation of these Terms or otherwise disrupt or threaten the operation of the Service.&nbsp;Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, Docker complies with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and will remove User Content from the Service upon receipt of a compliant takedown notice (see Section 16 below).&nbsp;You agree to immediately take down any User Content that violates the Terms, including pursuant to a take-down request from Docker.&nbsp;In the event that you elect not to comply with a request from Docker to take down certain User Content, Docker reserves the right to directly take down such User Content, or to suspend or terminate your use of the Service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.3&nbsp;</strong>By uploading or submitting your User Content through the Service, you hereby grant Docker and its affiliates and partners (collectively, the \u201cDocker Licensees\u201d) a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free license to reproduce (including by making mechanical reproductions), reformat, distribute, publicly display, and publicly perform your User Content in connection with providing you and other users with the services, features and functionalities available on or through the Service.\nprovided, that for any User Content that is subject to an open source license, Docker\u2019s rights shall be limited to the rights granted under the applicable open source license.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.4&nbsp;</strong>The Service allows you to specify or upload the terms under which other users of the Service will be licensed to use your User Content.&nbsp;If you do not specify or upload such license terms with respect to any User Content, you hereby grant to any other users of the Service, a non-exclusive license to access, download, use, modify or otherwise exploit such part of your User Content for any personal or business purposes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.5&nbsp;</strong>You are solely responsible for your own User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing them.&nbsp;In connection with User Content, you affirm, represent, and warrant that: (i) you either own your User Content or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to grant the rights and licenses granted in these Terms, and (ii) the Docker Licensee\u2019s exercise of the license rights set forth in this Section 6, does not and will not require obtaining a license from or paying any fees and/or royalties by Docker to any third party for the exercise of any rights granted in these Terms.&nbsp;However, the foregoing shall not be deemed a warranty by you of non-infringement of any third party patent rights.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.6&nbsp;</strong>You understand that Docker may inspect your User Content, including but not limited to scanning for vulnerabilities, at any time to check for potential security vulnerabilities and other issues.&nbsp;Docker may request that you immediately remedy any issue it discovers in your User Content and retains the right to remove any User Content at any time without notice for any valid business or technical reasons, such as if security vulnerabilities are identified in such User Content.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.7&nbsp;</strong>You understand that User Content made available on or through the Service comes from a variety of sources and that Docker does not endorse and is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such User Content.&nbsp;You understand that Docker cannot, and does not, review all User Content and does not endorse any User Content.&nbsp;You further understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, misleading, infringing, or otherwise

must provide the following information in writing:</p>\n<p>a.\nAn electronic or physical signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner;</p>\n<p>b.\nIdentification of the copyrighted work that you claim is being infringed;</p>\n<p>c.\nIdentification of the material that is claimed to be infringing and where it is located on the Service;</p>\n<p>d.\nInformation

are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on behalf of the owner.</p>\n<p>Docker\u2019s Designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement can be reached as

Sites\n<p>\n<strong>17.1&nbsp;</strong>The Service may include hyperlinks to other web sites or resources (collectively, \u201c<strong>External Sites</strong>\u201d) solely as a convenience to its users.&nbsp;Docker has no control over any External Sites which are provided by companies or persons other than Docker.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.2&nbsp;</strong>You acknowledge and agree that Docker is not responsible for the availability of any External Sites, and does not endorse any advertising, products or other materials on or available from the External Sites.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.3&nbsp;</strong>You acknowledge and agree that Docker is not liable for any loss or damage which may be incurred as a result of the availability of the External Sites, or as a result of any reliance placed by you on the completeness, accuracy or existence of any advertising, products or other materials on, or available from, the External Sites.</p>\n18.\nChanges to the Terms\n<p>Docker may make changes to the Terms from time to time.&nbsp;When such changes are made, Docker will make the updated Terms available on or through the Service.&nbsp;Please check these Terms periodically for changes.&nbsp;Unless otherwise agreed to between you and Docker in writing, your continued use of the Service after such changes have been published on or through the Service shall constitute your binding acceptance of such changes.&nbsp;Unless otherwise agreed to between you and Docker in writing, in the event that such changes materially alter your rights or obligations hereunder such amended Terms will automatically be effective upon the earlier of (i) your continued use of the Service with actual knowledge of such modifications, or (ii) 30 days from the date such modified Terms are made available on or through the Service.&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, the resolution of any dispute that arises between you and Docker will be governed by the Terms in effect at the time such dispute arose.</p>\n19.\nDispute Resolution and Arbitration\n<p>\n<strong>19.1&nbsp;</strong>Generally.\nIn the interest of resolving disputes between you and Docker in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Docker agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\nOur agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms.\nYOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND DOCKER ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19.2&nbsp;</strong>Exceptions.\nDespite the provisions of Section 19.1, we both agree that nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either of us to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court.\n(b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available.\n(c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law.\nor (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19.3&nbsp;</strong>Arbitrator.\nAny arbitration between you and Docker will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, \u201c<strong>AAA Rules</strong>\u201c) of the American Arbitration Association (\u201c<strong>AAA</strong>\u201c), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA.\nThe AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Docker.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19.4&nbsp;</strong>Notice.\nProcess.\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or if we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\u201c<strong>Notice</strong>\u201c).\nDocker\u2019s address for Notice is: Docker, Inc., 3790 El Camino Real #1052, Palo Alto, CA 94306.\nThe Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\u201c<strong>Demand</strong>\u201c).\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Docker may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Docker must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.&nbsp;If our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Docker will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any.\n(ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Docker in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator\u2019s award.\nor (iii) $1,000.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19.5&nbsp;</strong>Fees.\nIf you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Docker will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.\nAny arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Santa Clara County, California USA but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing.\nor (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.&nbsp;If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\nIn that case, you agree to reimburse Docker for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19.6&nbsp;</strong>No Class Actions.\nYOU AND DOCKER AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nFurther, unless both you and Docker agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19.7&nbsp;</strong>Modifications.\nIf Docker makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Docker\u2019s address for Notice), you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Docker\u2019s address for Notice, in which case your account with Docker will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject will survive.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19.8&nbsp;</strong>Enforceability.\nIf Section 19.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 19 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 19 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 20.7 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p>\n20.\nGeneral Legal Terms\n<p>\n<strong>20.1&nbsp;</strong>The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Docker and govern your use of the Service (but excluding any services which Docker may provide to you under a separate written agreement) and completely replace any prior agreements between you and Docker in relation to the Service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>20.2&nbsp;</strong>There are no third party beneficiaries to these Terms.&nbsp;The parties are independent contractors, and nothing in these Terms creates an agency, partnership or joint venture.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>20.3&nbsp;</strong>If Docker provides you with a translation of the English language version of these Terms, the English language version of these Terms will control if there is any conflict.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>20.4&nbsp;</strong>You agree that Docker may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Service.&nbsp;By providing Docker your email address, you consent to our using the email address to send you any notices required by law in lieu of communication by postal mail.&nbsp;You may provide us with legal notices at our postal address set forth above or via email to support@docker.com.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>20.5&nbsp;</strong>You agree that if Docker does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Docker has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be deemed a waiver of any such rights or remedies, and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Docker.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>20.6&nbsp;</strong>Docker shall not be liable for failing or delaying performance of its obligations resulting from any condition beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to, governmental action, acts of terrorism, earthquake, fire, flood or other acts of God, labor conditions, power failures, and Internet disturbances.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>20.7&nbsp;</strong>The Terms, and your relationship with Docker under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.&nbsp;You and Docker agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California USA to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>20.8&nbsp;</strong>You understand that the Service is subject to United States export controls administered by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce and the United States Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control.\nYou acknowledge and agrees that the Service and any User Content or Third Party Content accessed by you shall not be used, transferred or otherwise exported or re-exported to countries as to which the United States, maintains an embargo (collectively, \u201c<strong>Embargoed Countries</strong>\u201c), or to or by a national or resident thereof, or any person or entity on the U.S.\nDepartment of Treasury\u2019s List of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce\u2019s Entity List, Denied Persons List, or Unverified List, or the U.S.\nDepartment of State\u2019s Nonproliferation Sanctions list (collectively, \u201c<strong>Designated Nationals</strong>\u201c).\nThe lists of Embargoed Countries and Designated Nationals are subject to change without notice.\nBy using the Service, including without limitation by uploading or accessing any User Content or Third Party Content, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of an Embargoed Country or Designated National.\nYou agree to comply strictly with all U.S.\nexport laws and assume sole responsibility for obtaining United States government export licenses to export or re-export as may be required.\nYou will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Docker and its suppliers and licensors from and against any violation of such laws or regulations by you or any of your agents, officers, directors or employees.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>20.9&nbsp;</strong>Neither party may assign any of its rights or obligations under these Terms, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld).&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, Docker may assign the entirety of its rights and obligations under these Terms, without your consent, to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets.&nbsp;Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of these Terms will be void.</p> ", "created_at": "2021-07-01 22:04:23.4297",
