level or preferences of each Forver(s).</p>\n<p>Likewise, Forvo Academy allows the Personal Trainer(s) to offer their services of online language sessions on the platform, to offer their professional

their respective interests.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The \"Forvo Academy\" Service includes the provision to the Users of the technical resources required for the correct provision and management of the Services, including the methods of sending and receiving payments for the sessions, procedures and assistance for the resolution of disputes, calendars, agendas, user profiles, etc.\nAre\texpressly excluded from the Services, those provided outside the Forvo online platform.</p>\n<p>In all cases, it is hereby understood that Forvo only provides a connecting or technical platform for Users to contact and engage with each other, and Forvo does not participate in the direct transactions or relationships between Users, only in the platform's services in connection with the technical and/or economic management of the sessions.</p>\n<p>Forvo does not control or oversees by default the conduct of Users in the platform, or on services provided by the Personal Trainer(s), their quality, their academic or other content, however, in cases where Forvo understands, according to its sole discretion, than any comment, assessment, action or any omission by a User on the platform is contrary to these Terms, to the Applicable Law or violates any rights of third parties, Forvo may take the necessary measures to prevent it, notwithstanding its notification or complaint to the Competent Authority in each case.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Technical Requirements:</strong> The specific services of Forvo Academy will be accessible or available to all Users through\tthe use, as recommended equipment, of a personal computer (laptop or desktop) with a webcam, speakers or sound reproduction system and a good quality connection to the Internet.\nForver(s) Users may also access the Service through a mobile device, however, for a better user experience, Forvo recommends the use of the resources described above.\nFor Personal Trainer(s) Users, the use of the recommended means is always obligatory.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How it works:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<u>User profile:</u> the Forver(s) as well as the Personal Trainer(s) will have a personal profile from which they will be able to manage their participation in Forvo Academy, booking sessions, sending messages, scheduling and/or cancelling sessions, etc.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Duration of sessions:</u> The sessions or sessions scheduled between the Forver(s) and the Personal Trainer(s) will have an estimated duration of one (1) hour.\nForvo reserves the right to establish a different duration of the sessions, which will be communicated sufficiently well in advance to the User(s).</li>\n<li>\n<u>Price and Payment of the sessions:</u> The price of the sessions will be the one set by each Personal Trainer(s) and will be indicated in Forvo Academy at the moment of booking the session, being this an initial or individual session or as part of a \"pack\" or group of sessions.\nAt the time of booking the session or group of sessions, the Forver(s) must pay the price set for the session and the applicable Service Fee, through Forvo Academy's integrated payment system.\nThe payment system will ask you for the necessary information (Credit or Debit Card details) to process the payment.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Scheduling of sessions:</u> The Forver will be able to schedule or re-schedule his/her session/s according to the time availability that each Personal Trainer establishes.\nThis availability time will be visible in the profile of each Personal Trainer(s) and it will determine the date and time the Personal Trainer(s) must provide the Service.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Re-scheduling of sessions:</u> The Forver can re-schedule a session previously scheduled if it does so over 24 hours <strong>(&gt;24h)</strong> before the time of its scheduled completion, not requiring the authorization or approval of the Personal Trainer(s).\nIf the Forver requests such modification with a shorter anticipation <strong>(&lt;24 hours)</strong>, he/she will wait for the Personal Trainer to authorize the change.\nThe Personal Trainer may in its response: (i) accept the new schedule proposed by the Forver(s) (it may be without a specific date, i.e.\nleave it open for scheduling in the future).\n(ii) decide to reject the Forver(s) proposal, in which case the Forver(s) loses the option to receive the scheduled session and the session will be considered as completed for all purposes.\nIn the event that the Personal Trainer <strong>does not respond</strong> one way or the other to the new scheduling, the Forver will not lose the option to receive the session, and the session will remain open for future scheduling by the Forver.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Session Cancellation:</u> The Forver(s) is able to cancel a previously scheduled session if he/she makes the\tcancellation <strong>at least 24 hours</strong> prior to the time of its initial scheduling.\nThis cancellation will be materialized in a credit to the Forver(s) that will figure in his/her control panel, and this credit will be applied and/or discounted automatically in the booking or scheduling of the following sessions.\nIf the cancellation is made within less than 24 hours (&lt;24h), the Forver(s) will lose the possibility of carrying out the session.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Materials and/or content:</u> For the regular development of the sessions, besides Forvo Academy's own tools (virtual whiteboard, downloading online files, personal chat, etc.), it will be possible to use the content or learning material that the Personal Trainer(s) have chosen, which can be shared in the formats established in the platform.\nThe use and/or sharing of these contents will be in any case subject to the licensing conditions\ton the Content of the Personal Trainer(s) included in the Intellectual Property Rights Clause.\nThe material used and/or shared for the realization of the sessions will be available for a period of 180 days from the end of the session in question, after which the material will no longer be accessible.</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<u>\n<strong>Economic Management:</strong>\n</u> As an integral part of the Services, and subject to the application of the Services Fees, Forvo will manage the charges and/or payments arising from the booking and imparting of sessions by the Users.\nThis means that between the Forver(S) User and the Personal Trainer(s) may only mutually agree upon the specific terms under which the learning session(s) will be conducted and that the payment for the price of the sessions by the Forver(s) and the receipt of the corresponding payment by the Personal Trainer(s) will be entirely managed by the payment platform of Forvo Academy.</p>\n<p>In this sense, Forvo will be the depositary of the amounts paid by the Forver(s) for the price of the booked\tsessions and, after verification of the effective completion of the sessions and the absence of any possible incidences, will pay the Personal Trainer(s) the amounts that are finally liquid after the application of the Service Fees applicable at each moment and the taxes or fees in accordance with the Applicable Law.\nIn all cases, Forvo will generate the corresponding receipts (invoices) or proof of payment for all transactions carried out by both the Forver(s) and the Personal Trainer(s).</p>\n<p>This economic management of the Service by Forvo does NOT INCLUDE or replace the individual fulfillment of the accounting or tax obligations that, according to the Applicable Law, are derived from the direct provision of language teaching services between the Personal Trainer(s) and the Forver(s) through Forvo Academy and that, in any case, will be the individual responsibility of the latter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>Ratings, reviews:</u> Subject to strict compliance with the Forvo Academy Compliance Policy and Applicable Law, Forver(s) may provide ratings or reviews about the conduct of sessions or the professional performance of Personal Trainer(s) and these may be visible on the Platform.\nThese ratings may be subject to review and/or editing by Forvo prior to publication in order to adjust to Forvo Academy's Compliance Policy and Applicable Law.\nIn the same way, the Personal Trainer(s), if necessary, may also answer, clarify or explain\tany aspect related to these evaluations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a general condition, the performance and/or availability of Forvo Academy will be continuous, however, for technical reasons related to updating and/or the improvement of the technological infrastructure that makes it possible to provide the Services, there may be programmed interruptions for this purpose.\nIn these cases, Forvo will notify the Users with sufficient time in advance of these interruptions through
