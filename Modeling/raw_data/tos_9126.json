Use<br>&nbsp.\n<p>Effective Date: Nov 24, 2020 </p>\n<p>The Internet of Things Privacy Infrastructure Website is a website under which Carnegie Mellon University (\u201dCMU\u201d) provides part of the Internet of Things privacy infrastructure (\u201cIoT privacy infrastructure\u201d or \u201cIoT PI\u201d) created under a research project directed by Prof.\nNorman Sadeh.\nThe IoT PI enables people and organizations to inform the public about the presence of IoT devices, IoT services, and IoT apps &nbsp;(collectively referred to as \u201cIoT Resources\u201d) deployed in a given area, such as a university campus, a building, a shopping &nbsp;mall, a room, a stadium, a city block, an entire neighborhood, or a larger geographical area.\nThe Internet of Things Privacy Infrastructure Project has two components:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internet of Things Assistant (\u201cIoTA\u201d) mobile app (\u201cIoTA Mobile App\u201d), which helps users discover IoT Resources deployed in their vicinity by identifying and querying registries of IoT Resources that pertain to the user\u2019s current location (\u201cIoT Resource Registries\u201d or \u201cIRRs\u201d).\nThe IoTA Mobile App informs the user about the data collection and use practices associated with the IoT Resources it discovers.\nThe IoTA Mobile App also enables users to discover and configure privacy settings that may be offered by IoT Resources (i.e.\ndata deletion, opting in or out of some data collection or sharing practices, or data access requests), and users may receive notifications from the IoTA Mobile App about nearby IoT Resources.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IoT PI website (currently available at https://www.iotprivacy.io&nbsp;as IoT Portal) which enables people and organizations to inform the public about the presence of IoT Resources deployed in different areas.\nUsing the IoT PI website, individuals and organizations can request the creation of IRRs.\n&nbsp;Individuals and organizations can also use the IoT PI website to create descriptions of IoT Resources (\u201cIoT Resource Listings\u201d) and to publish them, enabling mobile users to discover published IoT Resource Listings using their IoTA Mobile App.\nThe IoT PI website also enables users to create partial descriptions of IoT Resources that others could use as a starting point to create IoT Resource Listings (\u201cIoT Resource Templates\u201d).\nThese IoT Resource Templates can be shared with, re-used and edited by others to publicize the presence of identical or similar IoT Resources.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Each IoT Resource Listing includes a description of the data collection and use practices associated with a given IoT Resource, which may include, among other things, what data the Resource collects, how it is used, who it is shared with, for how long the data is retained, etc.\nMore generally, IoT Resource Listings are a way of advertising the presence of IoT Resources in a given area (e.g., advertising the existence of a mobile app that people can download to help them navigate a building, a neighborhood, or a mall.\nor advertising the presence of a network of surveillance cameras with facial recognition).</p>\n<p>BY CLICKING \u201cAgree,\u201d ACCESSING AND/OR USING THE IOT PI, YOU ARE AGREEING TO THESE TERMS OF USE (THE \u201cTOU\u201d) ON BEHALF OF YOU AND YOUR ORGANIZATION TO THE EXTENT YOU ARE ACCESSING THE APPLICATION ON BEHALF OF AN ORGANIZATION.\nTHESE TOU ARE A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT WITH CMU WITH RESPECT TO THE IOT PI .\n</p>\n<p>IF THESE TOU ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE TO YOU AND YOUR ORGANIZATION, YOU MUST CLICK \"Disagree\" AND YOU, YOUR ORGANIZATION AND ITS USERS MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE IOT PI.</p>\n<p>Additional Terms.\nCertain features of the IoT PI may be subject to additional terms (\u201cAdditional Terms\u201d) presented in conjunction with the features.\nRegardless of how they are presented to you, you must agree to these Additional Terms before using the features of the IoT PI to which they apply.\nUnless otherwise specified in these Additional Terms, all Additional Terms are incorporated into this Agreement.\nIf you do not agree to these Additional Terms, then you may not use the features to which they relate.\nThis Agreement and Additional Terms apply equally but, if any Additional Term is inconsistent with any provision of this Agreement, the Additional Term will prevail for the IoT PI functionality or features to which the Additional Terms apply.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The IoT PI website is being provided by CMU as part of a research study under CMU\u2019s IRB ID STUDY2017_00000215 and use of the IoT PI website is further subject to accepting the study consent forms during the account set-up process.</p>\n<p>Account Set-Up.\nUser Account Names and Passwords.\nA user name and password will be required to access the IoT PI (currently available at https://www.iotprivacy.io), to request the creation of an IRR, to create IoT Resource Listings, to request the publication of these IoT Resource Listings in one or more IRRs, and to create IoT Resource Templates.\nPeople can request the creation of an account at https://www.iotprivacy.io/register.\nTo enable the account set-up, you must provide a user account name for each person at your organization who is intended to access the IoT PI.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>User accounts can be granted different roles: IRR owners/administrators or IRR contributors, or IoT Resource Template contributors.\nThese roles are all specific to a given IRR.\nThese roles entail different levels of access through the IoT PI.\nUsers agree not to share their user account names and passwords with others.</p>\n<p>IRR Owners/Administrators:&nbsp;To be an IRR owner/administrator, you will first agree to the study consent form provided.\nYou will then need to complete a request form, in which you will provide your name, contact email, organization name and type, and a description of the purpose for which you plan to use each registry you are requesting, including the area it will cover, namely the area where it will be allowed to publicize the presence of IoT Resources.\nThe information you provide may be used in part to vet your request, prevent abuse and to contact you.\nOnce an IRR is created for you by CMU, you automatically become the \u201cowner\u201d of the IRR.\nAs owner, you have administrator privileges for the IRR and may also give administrator privileges to other users to the extent they have agreed to the same IRB consent form, the same Terms of Use https://www.iotprivacy.io/terms-of-use&nbsp;and acknowledged the Privacy Policy https://www.iotprivacy.io/privacy-policy.\nIRR owners/administrators have overall responsibility for approving requests to publish IoT Resource Listings in their IRRs and establishing adequate procedures to manage content published in their IRRs.</p>\n<p>If you are an IRR owner/administrator you agree that you are the (data) controller (as defined under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (\u201cGDPR\u201d)) of information you publicize through the IRRs you own or manage.\nYou agree that you: (i) have provided adequate notice and obtained any necessary consents from data subjects required for personal data collected in connection with an IRR you own or manage, and (ii) abided by any privacy choices (including opt-out preferences) of data subjects relating to the personal data you collect.\n</p>\n<p>IRR Contributors: To be an IRR contributor, you will first agree to the study consent form provided.\nYou will need to create an IoT PI user account with a display name and a valid email address.\nThe information you provide may be used in part to vet your contributions, to prevent abuse and to contact you.\nIRR contributors can enter descriptions of IoT Resource Listings using a form that includes fields such as the location where the IoT Resource will be discoverable and the data it collects.\nThere are two ways to publish IoT Resource Listings: self-publication by IRR contributors and publication in an IRR through publication submissions.\nFor self-publication, each IRR contributor can publish IoT Resource Listings and is responsible for the content of their IoT Resource Listings.\nFor publication in an IRR, publication submissions may be vetted by the corresponding IRR owner/administrator, and different IRR owners/administrators may have different policies.\nNote that administrators of specific IRRs have the authority to decide whether or not a particular IoT Resource Listing gets published in that IRR, and CMU cannot guarantee that any particular IoT Resource Listing will be published.</p>\n<p>Once an IoT Resource Listing is published, it will be publicly discoverable through the IoT privacy infrastructure and in particular users using their IoTA Mobile App.\nSince their contents are not vetted by Registry owner/administrators, self-published IoT Resource Listings may be shown differently from IoT Resource Listings published in an IRR on IoTA Mobile App.\nIRR contributors are responsible for the descriptions of their IoT Resource Listings.\n</p>\n<p>Since the purpose of IoT Resource listings is to provide information to all users of the IoT privacy infrastructure, the display name associated with your user account will be made visible to IoT privacy infrastructure users, including IoTA Mobile App users, who view the IoT Resource Listings you have created and published.</p>\n<p>If you are an IRR contributor you agree that you are authorized to share any information you contribute to an IRR.\nYou agree that you will not include personal data, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, and IP addresses, in contributions you make to an IRR.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>IoT Resource Template Contributors: The IoT PI also enables users to create IoT Resource Templates, which include partial descriptions of IoT Resources.\nThese IoT Resource Templates can be shared with, re-used and edited by others to publicize the presence of identical or similar IoT Resources.\nAn IoT Resource Template includes an IoT Resource Template names, an IoT Resource Template description, links to privacy policies and privacy settings.\nTo be an IoT Resource Template contributor, you will first agree to the study consent form provided, the TOU and acknowledge the Privacy Policy https://www.iotprivacy.io/privacy-policy.\nYou will also need to create an IoT PI user account with a display name and a valid email address.\nSince the purpose of IoT Resource Templates is to provide partial descriptions of IoT Resources to other IoT PI users and enable these other IoT PI users to re-use and edit these templates to publicize the presence of identical or similar IoT Resources, the display name associated with your user account will be made visible to other IoT PI users who look at the IoT Resource Templates you have created.</p>\n<p>If you are an IoT Resource Template Contributor you agree that you are authorized to share any information you include in the IoT Resource Templates you create.\nYou agree that you will not include personal data, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, and IP addresses, in such templates and agree that you responsible for the information you provide in the IoT Resource Templates you create.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Content.\n\"Content\u201d means all information, data, text, photographs, graphics, video, messages, tags, or other materials accessed, posted and/or transmitted through the IoT PI.\n\"User Content\" is any Content provided by and/or originating from a user (regardless of whether IRR owner/administrator IRR contributor or IoT Resource Template contributor).\n\u201cIoT PI

Things Privacy Infrastructure Project is a system developed at the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, under the coordination of Prof.\nNorman Sadeh.\nIts purpose is to provide a tool to publicize the presence of IoT devices, IoT services, IoT apps (collectively referred to as \u201cIoT Resources\u201d) in a given area, such as a university campus, a building, a shopping mall, a room, a stadium, a city block, an entire neighborhood, or a larger geographical area.\nThe Internet of Things Privacy Infrastructure Project has two components: </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IoTA Mobile App, which helps users discover IoT Resources deployed in their vicinity by identifying and querying IoT Resource Registries that pertain to the user\u2019s current location.\nThe IoTA informs the user about the data collection and use practices associated with the IoT Resources it discovers.\nThe IoTA also enables users to discover and configure privacy settings that may be offered by IoT Resources (i.e.\ndata deletion, opting in or out of some data collection or sharing practices, or data access requests).\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IoT PI, which enables people and organizations to inform the public about the presence of IoT Resources deployed in different areas.\nIndividuals and organizations can request the creation of IRRs through the IoT PI.\n&nbsp;Individuals and organizations can use the IoT PI to create descriptions of IoT Resources (\u201cIoT Resource Listings\u201d) and request their publication in IRRs, enabling mobile users to discover them using their IoTA Mobile App.\nThe IoT PI also enables users to create partial descriptions of IoT Resources that others could use as a starting point to create IoT Resource Listings (\u201cIoT Resource Templates\u201d).\nThese IoT Resource Templates can be shared with, re-used and edited by others to publicize the presence of identical or similar IoT Resources.\n&nbsp;The IoT PI involves the collection of research data under the direction of Prof.\nNorman Sadeh (the Principal Investigator) in accordance with a research protocol approved by CMU\u2019s Institutional Review Board.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The research project related to the IoT PI is funded by the U.S.\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) under the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2019s Brandeis Privacy Initiative (Grant FA8750-15-2-0277) and by the U.S.\nNational Science Foundation under its Secure and Trustworthy Computing program (Grant SBE-1513957).\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>CMU collects data to provide the Services you request, addressing security issues and potential abuse, ease your navigation of Services supported by our IoTA Mobile App and our IoT PI, communicate with you, improve your experience using the Services and also collect data for research conducted under our project \u2013 the latter follows research protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board.\nSome of this data is provided by you directly, such as when you register for the Services.\nSome of the information is collected through your interactions with the Services.\nWe collect such data using technologies like cookies and other tracking technologies, error reports, and usage data collected when you interact with CMU Services running on your device.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The data we collect depends on the Services and features thereof that you use, and includes the following: </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Data Collected through the IoTA Mobile App: </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Profile Data: Your Email ID, username and password: to create an account that will enable you to use the IoTA Mobile App and that will enable us to communicate with you.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Location Data: &nbsp;Your Location Data is used to show you relevant IoT Resource Registries and IoT Resources, namely to identify IoT Resource Registries that might be publicizing the presence of IoT Resources near your location, identify nearby IoT Resources, identify the data collection and use practices of these IoT Resources, and to notify you of this information via the IoTA Mobile App.\nLocation data is not accessed or stored anywhere in our databases.\nThe IoTA Mobile App keeps track of the IoT Resources you have been near and the most recent date and time you were near each IoT Resource (\u201cProximity Data\u201d, a subcategory of Location Data).\nProximity Data enables us to provide you with personalized notifications of nearby IoT Resources and avoid sending you repetitive notifications, depending on your notification settings.\nProximity Data is only stored on your mobile device.\nis encrypted.\nand is deleted (1) when you change your notification settings (selecting between \u201calways\u201d, \u201cthe first time\u201d and \u201cnever\u201d) or (2) when you uninstall the IoTA mobile app from your device.\nProximity Data could be used to infer your location.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Motion &amp.\nFitness Activity Data : This data is used to minimize battery consumption on your mobile device and is only accessed when you grant \u201cLocation (always)\u201d and \u201cNotification\u201d permissions to the IoTA Mobile App on your mobile device.\nThis data is collected by your mobile device and only accessed by the IoTA Mobile App to determine when to refresh the data it displays and when to check whether there are new IoT Resources near you that you should be notified about.\nThis data is not stored by the IoTA Mobile App or anywhere in our databases.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Technical Data: &nbsp;Metadata that is used for the research purpose of understanding how you interact with our Mobile App.\nThis data will be analyzed to learn about the usability of the IoTA Mobile App.\nThis will include time spent using the app, navigation of different menu options, types of IoT Resources and data practices you look at, and crash reports.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Unique identifiers Used to Keep Track of User-Specific Privacy Decisions: &nbsp;These identifiers are used to keep track of your privacy decisions about options made available by IoT Resources, whether directly or via third party privacy options management functionality - when such options are available.\nThe unique identifiers are used by the IoT Resources themselves or by third party privacy options management functionality to communicate your decisions to our IoT PI.\nThey are also used by our IoT PI to communicate your decisions back to your IoTA Mobile App.\nExamples of privacy decisions include opting in, opting out, requesting deletion of your data, and more.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Your Privacy Decisions: Privacy decisions that you make using the IoTA Mobile App such as opting in or out of some data collection and use practices, requesting that your data be deleted or exercising other privacy choices made available by individual IoT Resources published in the IoT Privacy Infrastructure.\nThese decisions are directly communicated by you to the IoT Resource or to third party privacy options management functionality responsible for implementing them.\nPlease bear in mind that actual implementation of privacy decisions you make about any options made available by IoT Resources is not the responsibility of the IoT PI.\nInstead these decisions are implemented by the IoT Resources themselves, possibly via third party privacy options management functionality.\nSuch implementation is the responsibility of the IoT Resource owner, who is the Controller of any data collected by the IoT Resource.\nOur IoT PI collects your privacy decisions, in part for research purposes and in part to be able to show these decisions to you via your IoTA Mobile App.\nAs part of our research, we use your privacy decisions to support the development of models of your privacy preferences using machine learning.\nYour privacy decisions are uniquely identified and linked to your email ID.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Data Collected through the IoT PI &nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Profile Data: Email, username and password of IoT PI users (namely IRR contributors, IRR owners/administrators, IoT Resource Template contributors) to enable them to create an account and use the IoT PI.\nThis data is also used to communicate with IoT PI users and mitigate abuse.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Identity Data: First and last name, country (or countries) within which the area covered by an IRR falls for users who request an IRR, and organization for users who interact with the IoT PI on behalf of an organization (e.g., employee or member of an organization).\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Location Data: Browser location of IRR contributors and administrators/owners is accessed to center maps on pages for IoT Resource creation and IRR configuration.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>IoT Resource Listings: Information you contribute regarding IoT Resources.\nThis information may include resource names, locations, descriptions, links to privacy policies and privacy settings, and other information.\nResource listings only include personal information to the extent you enter such information as part of the resource listing.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>IoT Resource Templates : Information you contribute regarding IoT Resource Templates.\nThis information may include IoT Resource Template names, IoT Resource Template descriptions, links to privacy policies and privacy settings, and other information.\nIoT Resource Templates only include personal information to the extent you enter such information as part of the IoT Resource Template.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Unique identifiers Used to Keep Track of User-Specific Privacy Decisions: &nbsp;These identifiers are used to keep track of your privacy decisions about options made available by IoT Resources, whether directly or via third- party privacy options management functionality - when such options are available.\nThe unique identifiers are used by the IoT Resources themselves or by third party privacy options management functionality to communicate your decisions to our IoT PI.\nThey are also used by our IoT PI to communicate your decisions back to your IoTA Mobile App.\nExamples of privacy decisions include opting in, opting out, requesting deletion of your data, and more.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Technical Data: &nbsp;Metadata that is used for the research purpose of understanding how you interact with the IoT PI.\nFor instance, we may look at the number of times you click on \u201cmore information\u201d icons, the amount of time you spend in creating an IoT Resource listing or an IoT Resource Template, and other actions indicative of how you interact with the IoT PI.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Information stored by session cookies .\nWe use session cookies that allow you to be recognized within the IoT PI without requiring you re-authenticate from page to page.\nThese session cookies expire once you log out or after 2 hours of inactivity.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>HOW WE USE PERSONAL DATA </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to.\nMost commonly, we will use your personal data for the following lawful purposes: </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where we need such information to perform the contract (i.e.\nTerms of Use or End-User License Agreement) we are about to enter into or have

need them, the Cookies we use on the Services can be grouped into the following categories: </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strictly Necessary: These Cookies are necessary for the Services to work properly.\nThey include any essential authentication and authorization Cookies for the Services.\n</li>\n<li>Functionality: These Cookies enable technical performance and allow us to

multiple browsers or devices to access websites, you will need to manage your cookie preferences across these environments.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If you are using a mobile device to access the

https://www.allaboutCookies.org .\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Do Not Track </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) incorporate a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d (\u201cDNT\u201d) or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked.\nIf a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser\u2019s user.\nNot all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform.\nFor this reason, many website operators, including CMU, do not respond to DNT signals.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>CHILDREN\u2019S PRIVACY </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 18, DO

</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>In the event that your personal data is subject to the GDPR, we will only use your personal data for the original purpose for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another purpose and that purpose is compatible with the original purpose.\nIf we need to use your EU personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.\nWe require third parties to only use your EU personal data for the specific purpose for which it was given to us and to protect the privacy of your personal data.\nIf your personal data is no longer necessary for the legal or business purposes for which it is processed, we will generally destroy or anonymize that data.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>International Transfers of Personal Data </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EU, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented: </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>European Commission Standard Contractual Clauses: We may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in the EU.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Privacy Shield.\nWhere we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>For additional information on the mechanisms used to protect your personal data, please contact us at GDPR-info@andrew.cmu.edu.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>We may update
