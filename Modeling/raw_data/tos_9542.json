environment.\nAlthough due care is taken, we cannot guarantee the security of information provided to us via electronic means or stored electronically.</p>\n<p>13.3.\nPersonal information is only retained for as long as is necessary for any purpose for which it may be used or disclosed under the Privacy Act or as otherwise required by law.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Back to top</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n14.\nHow

provide access to the personal information held about you, we will tell you why.</p>\n<p>14.5 We will take reasonable steps to only hold personal information about you that is accurate, complete,
