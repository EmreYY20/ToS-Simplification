license from the website will likely be both the Customer and the End User of the product.\nHowever, sometimes the Customer making the purchase may not be the person that will be using the product e.g.\na Customer &nbsp;purchasing the product on behalf of a school where the product is to be used by the school\u2019s students.\nThe personal data of Users of the products and services are described below in the various sections for each of our products and services.</p>\n<p>With regard to Customer personal information:</p>\n<p>What data do we collect?</p>\n<p>Texthelp collects customer

22 : Last reviewed 27-02-2023</p>Policy SummaryTexthelp will:<ul>\n<li>Comply with both the law and best practice regarding information security and privacy</li>\n<li>Respect individuals\u2019 rights</li>\n<li>Be open and honest with individuals whose data is held</li>\n<li>Provide training and support for staff who handle personal data, so that they can act confidently and consistently</li>\n</ul>The Texthelp group of companies&nbsp.\nrecognizes that its first priority regarding information security and privacy is to avoid causing harm to individuals.\n&nbsp;Predominantly&nbsp;&nbsp;this means keeping information securely, on a need to know basis, in the right hands.This is the top-level policy and, as well as outlining the company\u2019s information security objectives and how to meet them, it also includes a requirement for all security related documents to be reviewed periodically to ensure conformity and applicability.It is the responsibility of all employees to comply with the requirements of this and all policies.Although Texthelp\u2019s ISO 27001 scope of certification, at this time, includes:<ul>\n<li>Texthelp Ltd</li>\n<li>Texthelp Inc</li>\n<li>Texthelp PTY</li>\n<li>Lingit A/S</li>\n<li>Wizkids A/S</li>\n</ul>This information security policy is a description of best practice and is applicable across the Texthelp group of companies.Objectives <p>\n</p>\n<p>Texthelp will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deliver a secure, reliable cloud service for users and other interested parties who need confidence and assurance the platform is fit for their purpose of sharing and working with sensitive information.</li>\n<li>Provide a digital paperless ISMS&nbsp;for staff (and other interested parties who need to access it), integrated into their day to day work practices to ensure it becomes a habit for good performance not an inhibitor to getting their work done</li>\n<li>Implement a system to identify and assess information security risks and manage a risk treatment plan&nbsp;to mitigate risk to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information it holds or processes.</li>\n<li>Mitigate the risk of unauthorized&nbsp;or accidental disclosure of confidential information by staff or external parties</li>\n<li>Ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the company\u2019s information assets at all times</li>\n<li>Minimize the impact of any security incidents</li>\n<li>Continually improve the company\u2019s ability to assess, detect, reduce, avoid and ameliorate information security risks and/or incidents</li>\n<li>Work to avoid a negative impact to Texthelp\u2019s reputation and brand</li>\n<li>Protect the information of all interested parties including the personal information of its customers.\nShould the Texthelp company be acquired by another company at some future time, this will include checks that the acquiring company will have data security controls at least as robust as Texthelp\u2019s in place to ensure the future safeguarding of existing customer data.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Comply with any legal, regulatory or contractual requirements in respect of the data it holds about individuals.\nThese are listed in the List of Legislative &amp.\nRegulatory Bodies;</li>\n<li>Follow best practice</li>\n<li>Seek to continually improve the company\u2019s Information Security Management System</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>GDPR Compliance &amp.\nInternational Data Transfers&nbsp;<p>Texthelp Billing &amp.\nContact Data and Customer/User data (name only) &nbsp;is stored in Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nThe Texthelp Group has entered into Standard Contractual Clauses with AWS to ensure we comply with the GDPR rules on international transfers.\n&nbsp;This complies with data protection requirements and GDPR legislation when transferring data belonging to EU/UK citizens outside the EU/UK.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n</p>Key Risks &amp.\nMitigations<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Texthelp has identified potential key risks, which this policy, in conjunction with the Risk Treatment Plan, is designed to address.\nThese risks are logged and monitored in the company's Risk Register.\n</p>Responsibilities <p>\n</p>Information Security Committee<p>The role and responsibilities of this committee will be to provide: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysis &amp.\nDesign - The committee is also responsible for the analysis and design of the ISMS to ensure a meaningful security policy as well as effective security solutions exist.</li>\n<li>Administration - To look after the day to day administration of access rights, passwords, etc.</li>\n<li>Monitoring - To continuously monitor the security status of the organization, and manage incident response procedures.</li>\n<li>Awareness communication - To ensure awareness communication is conveyed throughout the company to ensure ongoing security awareness and also to provide the necessary training programs.\n</li>\n<li>Provide executive custody and governance - represented by the information security Committee.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>Data Protection

agents of Texthelp will be required to have an Information Security Policy at least as stringent as this policy.<p>Third party agents will also be contractually required, where this is possible, to

who are customers or users of Texthelp software.</p>\n<p>Information about the internal business of Texthelp.</p>\n<p>Personal information about colleagues working for Texthelp.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Texthelp &nbsp;is committed to keeping this information confidential, in order to protect people and Texthelp.\n&nbsp;\u2018Confidential\u2019 means that all access to information must be on a need to know and properly authorized basis.\n&nbsp;You must use only the information you have been authorized to use, and for purposes that have been authorized.\n&nbsp;You should also be aware that under the Data Protection Act, unauthorized access to data about individuals is a criminal offence.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You must assume that information is confidential unless you know that it is intended by Texthelp &nbsp;to be made public.\n&nbsp;Passing information between staff members in our international office, or between Texthelp &nbsp;and a 3rd party marketing partner who is in compliance with our policy, or vice versa&nbsp;does not count as making it public, but passing information to another organization does count.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You must also be particularly careful not to disclose confidential information to unauthorized people or cause a breach of security.\n&nbsp;In particular you must:</p>\n<p>not compromise or seek to evade security measures (including computer passwords);</p>\n<p>be particularly careful when sending information between our international offices;</p>\n<p>not discuss confidential information, either with colleagues or people outside Texthelp;</p>\n<p>not disclose information \u2014 especially over the telephone \u2014 unless you are sure that you know who you are disclosing it to, and that they are authorized to have it.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If you are in doubt about whether to disclose information or not, do not guess.\n&nbsp;Withhold the information while you check with an appropriate person whether the disclosure is appropriate.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Your confidentiality obligations continue to apply indefinitely after you have stopped working for Texthelp

performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or &nbsp;subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the &nbsp;selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which &nbsp;the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other &nbsp;contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which &nbsp;together are assembled into a collective whole.\nA work that constitutes a Collection will &nbsp;not be considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>c.\n\"Creative Commons Compatible License\" means a license that is listed at &nbsp;https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by Creative

the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has &nbsp;received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License &nbsp;despite a previous violation.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>j.\n\"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to &nbsp;communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including &nbsp;by wire or wireless means or public digital performances.\nto make available to the &nbsp;public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from &nbsp;a place and at a

limitations or exceptions that are &nbsp;provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other &nbsp;applicable laws.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3.\nLicense Grant.\nSubject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby &nbsp;grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the &nbsp;applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>a.\nto Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to &nbsp;Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>b.\nto create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any &nbsp;translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or &nbsp;otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work.\nFor example, a &nbsp;translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to &nbsp;Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\".\n</p>\n<p>c.\nto Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections.\n&nbsp;and, &nbsp;</p>\n<p>d.\nto Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>e.\nFor the avoidance of doubt: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>i.\nNon-waivable Compulsory License Schemes.\nIn those jurisdictions in which the &nbsp;right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme &nbsp;cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such &nbsp;royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>ii.\nWaivable Compulsory License Schemes.\nIn those jurisdictions in which the &nbsp;right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme &nbsp;can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties &nbsp;for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\nand, &nbsp;</p>\n<p>iii.\nVoluntary License Schemes.\nThe Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, &nbsp;whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a &nbsp;collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, &nbsp;from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\nThe above &nbsp;rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or &nbsp;hereafter devised.\nThe above rights include the right to make such &nbsp;</p>\n<p>modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media &nbsp;and formats.\nSubject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor &nbsp;are hereby reserved.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4.\nRestrictions.\nThe license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and &nbsp;limited by the following restrictions: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>a.\nYou may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License.\n&nbsp;You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License &nbsp;with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.\nYou may not offer or &nbsp;impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the &nbsp;recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of &nbsp;the License.\nYou may not sublicense the Work.\nYou must keep intact all notices that &nbsp;refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work &nbsp;You Distribute or Publicly Perform.\nWhen You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, &nbsp;You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the &nbsp;ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that &nbsp;recipient under the terms of the License.\nThis Section 4(a) applies to the Work as &nbsp;incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the &nbsp;Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License.\nIf You create a Collection, &nbsp;upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the &nbsp;Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.\nIf You create an &nbsp;Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove &nbsp;from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>b.\nYou may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this &nbsp;License.\n(ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this &nbsp;License.\n(iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license &nbsp;version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., &nbsp;AttributionShareAlike 3.0 US)).\n(iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License.\nIf you &nbsp;license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply &nbsp;with the terms of that license.\nIf you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of &nbsp;the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the \"Applicable License\"), you must comply &nbsp;with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You &nbsp;must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each &nbsp;Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform.\n(II) You may not offer or impose any &nbsp;terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability &nbsp;of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under </p>\n<p>the terms of the Applicable License.\n(III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to &nbsp;the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work &nbsp;as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform.\n(IV) when You &nbsp;Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective &nbsp;technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the &nbsp;Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of &nbsp;the Applicable License.\nThis Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in &nbsp;a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to &nbsp;be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>c.\nIf You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You &nbsp;must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all &nbsp;copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You &nbsp;are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if &nbsp;supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or &nbsp;parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution &nbsp;Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, &nbsp;the name of such party or parties.\n(ii) the title of the Work if supplied.\n(iii) to the extent &nbsp;reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with &nbsp;the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing &nbsp;information for the Work.\nand (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an &nbsp;Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French &nbsp;translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by &nbsp;Original Author\").\nThe credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any &nbsp;reasonable manner.\nprovided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, &nbsp;at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the &nbsp;Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least &nbsp;as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors.\nFor the avoidance of &nbsp;doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of &nbsp;attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this &nbsp;License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, &nbsp;sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution &nbsp;Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express &nbsp;prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>d.\nExcept as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise &nbsp;permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work &nbsp;either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, &nbsp;mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be &nbsp;prejudicial to the Original Author\u2019s honor or reputation.\nLicensor agrees that in those &nbsp;jurisdictions (e.g.\nJapan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of &nbsp;this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, &nbsp;mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author\u2019s &nbsp;honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this &nbsp;Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to &nbsp;reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make &nbsp;Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5.\nRepresentations, Warranties and Disclaimer &nbsp;</p>\n<p>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, &nbsp;LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR &nbsp;WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, &nbsp;STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, &nbsp;WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR &nbsp;PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER &nbsp;DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, </p>\n<p>WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.\nSOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW &nbsp;THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT &nbsp;APPLY TO YOU.\n6.\nLimitation on Liability.\nEXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY &nbsp;APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY &nbsp;LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE &nbsp;OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF &nbsp;THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF &nbsp;SUCH DAMAGES.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>7.\nTermination &nbsp;</p>\n<p>a.\nThis License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any &nbsp;breach by You of the terms of this License.\nIndividuals or entities who have received &nbsp;Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their &nbsp;licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with &nbsp;</p>\n<p>those licenses.\nSections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n&nbsp;b.\nSubject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for &nbsp;the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\nNotwithstanding the above, &nbsp;Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop &nbsp;distributing the Work at any time.\nprovided, however that any such election will not &nbsp;serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, &nbsp;granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and &nbsp;effect unless terminated as stated above.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>8.\nMiscellaneous &nbsp;</p>\n<p>a.\nEach time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor &nbsp;offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the &nbsp;license granted to You under this License.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>b.\nEach time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the &nbsp;recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the &nbsp;license granted to You under this License.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>c.\nIf any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall &nbsp;not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, &nbsp;and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be &nbsp;reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and &nbsp;enforceable.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>d.\nNo term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented &nbsp;to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be &nbsp;charged with such waiver or consent.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>e.\nThis License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the &nbsp;Work licensed here.\nThere are no understandings, agreements or representations with &nbsp;respect to the Work not specified here.\nLicensor shall not be bound by any additional &nbsp;provisions that may appear in any communication from You.\nThis License may not be &nbsp;modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>f.\nThe rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were &nbsp;drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary &nbsp;and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of &nbsp;1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms &nbsp;Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).\n&nbsp;These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the &nbsp;License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of &nbsp;the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.\nIf the &nbsp;standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional &nbsp;rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included </p>\n<p>in the License.\nthis License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under &nbsp;applicable law.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5.\nUK Open Gazetteer Data Files &nbsp;</p>\n<p>UK place names data and UK counties free data obtained from

a nonconformance, Licensor may, at its sole discretion, pass to the Licensee all costs of modifications and/or repairs at Licensor\u2019s prevailing rates.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Limitations</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The foregoing warranties apply only to Licensee.\nLicensor shall provide warranty service only for the most current version of the

options is reasonably available in Licensor's judgment, terminate this Agreement.\n&nbsp.\nHowever, Licensor has no obligation for any claim of infringement based on (i) modifications of the Product not made by Licensor or (ii) the combination, operation, or use of the Product with any product, data, content or apparatus not supported by Licensor, in each case to the extent the Product would not otherwise infringe.\nThis section states the entire liability of licensor for any claim of infringement involving the Product.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>By Licensee</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Licensee will defend at its own expense any third party claim against Licensor that the Licensee URLs and/or content displayed on Licensee URLs infringe any;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>copyright or intellectual

states the entire liability of licensee for any claim of infringement involving the licensed product.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Assistance with Defense</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The foregoing indemnities are in addition to any rights otherwise under this Agreement, but shall be expressly contingent on the non-indemnifying party;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>notifying the indemnifying party in writing of any such claim, demand, action, or liability.\n</li>\n<li>cooperating in the defense or settlement thereof (at the indemnifying party\u2019s expense).\nand </li>\n<li>allowing the indemnifying party to control the defense or settlement of the same,</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>provided that any settlement reached by the indemnifying party shall also include settlement of the indemnified party\u2019s liabilities.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY </li>\n</ol>\n<p>In no event shall either party be liable for;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>incidental, consequential, exemplary, punitive, special or indirect damages (including but not limited to lost business profits).\n</li>\n<li>any amounts in excess of the actual direct damages caused by the specific product or service complained of.\nor </li>\n<li>any amounts in the aggregate in excess of the amount actually paid to Licensor by Licensee hereunder in the twelve (12) months preceding the date of the claim,</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>in each case even if such party has been advised of the possibility of the same.\nThis section does not limit Licensee\u2019s obligations to make payment of all amounts payable to Licensor hereunder.\nBoth parties acknowledge and agree that this Section 10 represents a reasonable allocation of risk and that, in the absence of these limitations of liability, the terms of this Agreement would be substantially different.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>TERM AND TERMINATION</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Term </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, this Agreement will be effective for the Term.\nUpon the expiration of the Term, this Agreement may be renewed for one or more additional terms by written agreement of the parties, such agreement to be reached a minimum of thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the then current term.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Termination for Cause </li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the event of any material breach of this Agreement, the non-breaching party may terminate this Agreement by giving thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the other party.\nprovided, however, that this Agreement shall not terminate if the other party has cured the breach prior to the expiration of such thirty (30) day period, or if such breach cannot be cured within such thirty (30) day period, the other party has taken substantial steps acceptable to the non-breaching party within such thirty (30) day period to cure the breach and thereafter cured such breach as soon as practicable.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Termination for Insolvency </li>\n</ol>\n<p>This Agreement shall terminate, without notice.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>upon the institution by

creditors.\nor </li>\n<li>upon either party's dissolution or ceasing to do business.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Return of Materials </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Upon termination of this Agreement for any

Product.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Effect of Termination </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Termination shall not relieve Licensee of any of its payment obligations accrued prior to the effective date of the termination, nor shall it relieve either party of any of its indemnification obligations herein.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Survival </li>\n</ol>\n<p>The provisions of Sections 1, 9, 10, 11, 12 and

principles set forth in Annex A.</p>\n<p>Data importer to indicate which option it selects: Option (i)</p>\n<p>i)&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nIt will not disclose or transfer the personal data to a third party data controller located outside the European Economic Area (EEA) unless it notifies the data exporter about the transfer and</p>\n<p>&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;i.&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nthe third party data controller processes the personal data in accordance with a Commission decision finding that a third country provides adequate protection, or</p>\n<p>&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;ii.&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nthe third party data controller becomes a signatory to these clauses or another data transfer agreement approved by a competent authority in the EU,

been given the opportunity to object, after having been informed of the purposes of the transfer, the categories of recipients and the fact that the countries to which data is exported may have different data protection standards, or</p>\n<p>&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;iv.&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nwith regard to onward transfers of sensitive data, data subjects have given their unambiguous consent to the onward transfer</p>\n<p>III.&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nLiability and third party rights</p>\n<p>a)&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Each party shall be liable to the other parties for damages it causes by any breach of these clauses.\nLiability as between the parties is limited to actual damage suffered.\nPunitive damages (i.e.\ndamages intended to punish a party for its outrageous conduct) are specifically excluded.\nEach party shall be liable to data subjects for damages it causes by any breach of third party rights under these clauses.\nThis does not affect the liability of the data exporter under its data protection law.</p>\n<p>b)&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nThe parties agree that a data subject shall have the right to enforce as a third party beneficiary this clause and clauses I(b), I(d), I(e), II(a), II(c), II(d), II(e), II(h), II(i), III(a), V, VI(d) and VII against the data importer or the data exporter, for their respective breach of their contractual obligations, with regard to his personal data, and accept jurisdiction for this purpose in the data exporter\u2019s country of establishment.\nIn cases involving allegations of breach by the data importer, the data subject must first request the data exporter to take appropriate action to enforce his rights against the data importer.\nif the data exporter does not take such action within a reasonable period (which under normal circumstances would be one month), the data subject may then enforce his rights against the data importer directly.\nA data subject is entitled to proceed directly against a data exporter that has failed to use reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able to satisfy its legal obligations under these clauses (the data exporter shall have the burden to prove that it took reasonable efforts).</p>\n<p>IV.&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nLaw applicable to the clauses</p>\n<p>These clauses shall be governed by the law of the country in which the data exporter is established, with the exception of the laws and regulations relating to processing of the personal data by the data importer under clause II(h), which shall apply only if so selected by the data importer under that clause.</p>\n<p>V.&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nResolution of disputes with data subjects or the authority</p>\n<p>a)&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nIn the event of a dispute or claim brought by a data subject or the authority concerning the processing of the personal data against either or both of the parties, the parties will inform each other about any such disputes or claims, and will cooperate with a view to settling them amicably in a timely fashion.</p>\n<p>b)&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree to respond to any generally available non-binding mediation procedure initiated by a data subject or by the authority.\nIf they do participate in the proceedings, the parties may elect to do so remotely (such as by telephone or other electronic means).\nThe parties also agree to consider participating in any other arbitration, mediation or other dispute resolution proceedings developed for data protection disputes.</p>\n<p>c)&nbsp.\nEach party shall abide by a decision of a competent court of the data exporter\u2019s country of establishment or of the authority which is final and against which no further appeal is possible.</p>\n<p>VI.&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nTermination</p>\n<p>a)&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;In the event that the data importer is in breach of its obligations under these clauses, then the data exporter may temporarily suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until the breach is repaired or the contract is terminated.</p>\n<p>b)&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nIn the event that:</p>\n<p>&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;i.&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nthe transfer of personal data to the data importer has been temporarily suspended by the data exporter for longer than one month pursuant to paragraph (a);</p>\n<p>&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;ii.&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\ncompliance by the data importer with these clauses would put it in breach of its legal or regulatory obligations in the country of import;</p>\n<p>&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of any warranties or undertakings given by it under these clauses;</p>\n<p>&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a final decision against which no further appeal is possible of a competent court of the data exporter\u2019s country of establishment or of the authority rules that there has been a breach of the clauses by the data importer or the data exporter.\nor</p>\n<p>&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;v.&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\na petition is presented for the administration or winding up of the data importer, whether in its personal or business capacity, which petition is not dismissed within the applicable period for such dismissal under applicable law.\na winding up order is made.\na receiver is appointed over any of its assets.\na trustee in bankruptcy is appointed, if the data importer is an individual.\na company voluntary arrangement is commenced by it.\nor any equivalent event in any jurisdiction occurs</p>\n<p>then the data exporter, without prejudice to any other rights which it may have against the data importer, shall be entitled to terminate these clauses, in which case the authority shall be informed where required.\nIn cases covered by (i), (ii), or (iv) above the data importer may also terminate these clauses.</p>\n<p>c)&nbsp.\nEither party may terminate these clauses if (i) any Commission positive adequacy decision under Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC (or any superseding text) is issued in relation to the country (or a sector thereof) to which the data is transferred and processed by the data importer, or (ii) Directive 95/46/EC (or any superseding text) becomes directly applicable in such country.</p>\n<p>d)&nbsp.\nThe parties agree that the termination of these clauses at any time, in any circumstances and for whatever reason (except for termination under clause VI(c)) does not exempt them from the obligations and/or conditions under the clauses as regards the processing of the personal data transferred.</p>\n<p>VII.&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nVariation of these clauses</p>\n<p>The parties may not modify these clauses except to update any information in Annex B, in which case they will inform the authority where required.\nThis does not preclude the parties from adding additional commercial clauses where required.</p>\n<p>ANNEX A</p>\n<p>DATA PROCESSING PRINCIPLES</p>\n<p>1.&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose limitation: Personal data may be processed and subsequently used or further communicated only for purposes described in Annex B or subsequently authorised by the data subject.</p>\n<p>2.&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data quality and proportionality: Personal data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.\nThe personal data must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are transferred and further processed.</p>\n<p>3.&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Transparency: Data subjects must be provided with information necessary to ensure fair processing (such as information about the purposes of processing and about the transfer), unless such information has already been given by the data exporter.</p>\n<p>4.&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security and confidentiality: Technical and organisational security measures must be taken by the data controller that are appropriate to the risks, such as against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, presented by the processing.\nAny person acting under the authority of the data controller, including a processor, must not process the data except on instructions from the data controller.</p>\n<p>5.&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rights of access, rectification, deletion and objection: As provided in Article 12 of Directive 95/46/EC, data subjects must, whether directly or via a third party, be provided with the personal information about them that an organisation holds, except for requests which are manifestly abusive, based on unreasonable intervals or their number or repetitive or systematic nature, or for which access need not be granted under the law of the country of the data exporter.\nProvided that the authority has given its prior approval, access need also not be granted when doing so would be likely to seriously harm the interests of the data importer or other organisations dealing with the data importer and such interests are not overridden by the interests for fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.\nThe sources of the personal data need not be identified when this is not possible by reasonable efforts, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.\nData subjects must be able to have the personal information about them rectified, amended, or deleted where it is inaccurate or processed against these principles.\nIf there are compelling grounds to doubt the legitimacy of the request, the organisation may require further justifications before proceeding to rectification, amendment or deletion.\nNotification of any rectification, amendment or deletion to third parties to whom the data have been disclosed need not be made when this involves a disproportionate effort.\nA data subject must also be able to object to the processing of the personal data relating to him if there are compelling legitimate grounds relating to his particular situation.\nThe burden of proof for any refusal rests on the data importer, and the data subject may always challenge a refusal before the authority.</p>\n<p>6.&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sensitive data: The data importer shall take such additional measures (e.g.\nrelating to security) as are necessary to protect such sensitive data in accordance with its obligations under clause II.</p>\n<p>7.&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Data used for marketing purposes: Where data are processed for the purposes of direct marketing, effective procedures should exist allowing the data subject at any time to \u201copt-out\u201d from having his data used for such purposes.</p>\n<p>8.&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Automated decisions: For purposes hereof \u201cautomated decision\u201d shall mean a decision by the data exporter or the data importer which produces legal effects concerning a data subject or significantly affects a data subject and which is based solely on automated processing of personal data intended to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to him, such as his performance at work, creditworthiness, reliability, conduct, etc.\nThe data importer shall not make any automated decisions concerning data subjects, except when:</p>\n<p>a) &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.\nsuch decisions are made by the data importer in entering into or performing a contract with the &nbsp;data subject, and </p>\n<p>ii.\nthe data subject is given an opportunity to discuss the results of a relevant automated decision &nbsp;with a representative of the parties making such decision or otherwise to make representations to that parties.</p>\n<p>or</p>\n<p>b) &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where otherwise provided by the law of the data exporter.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>ANNEX B</p>\n<p>DESCRIPTION OF THE TRANSFER</p>\n<p>(To be completed by the parties)</p>\n<p>Data subjects</p>\n<p>The personal data transferred concern
