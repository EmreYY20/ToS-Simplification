Privacy\nWe're serious about your privacy\n<p>In accordance with the Tangerine Privacy Code and the principles set out in the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (\"P I P E D APIPEDA\"), we're committed to protecting the privacy of all the personal information in our care.</p>\nThe information we collect\n<p>Our biometric programs, such as Voice ID, use sophisticated biometric verification technologies developed by some of the world's foremost companies in this area.\nBiometric verification uses one or more of a person's unique physiological or behavioural characteristics for the purposes of identification.\nThis technology verifies a user's claimed identity by comparing an encoded value with a stored value of the subject's biometric characteristic.\nCommon types of biometrics include fingerprint, palm print, iris scan and voice recognition.\nTangerine's Voice ID program uses voice recognition biometrics to produce a model of your voice which is then used to create a secure method for accessing your personal information when you call us.</p>\n<p>You enroll in the Voice ID program by recording your voice speaking in natural conversation with an Associate over the phone.\nBy doing so, you consent to us using your voiceprint to confirm your identity in case you ever have trouble logging in when you call us.</p>\n<p>We will only collect information that is pertinent and consistent with the purposes of the collection.</p>\nHow we use your voiceprint\n<p>Your voiceprint is a numeric sequence that represents the features of your voice.\nOnce you've enrolled in the program, if you ever have trouble entering your PIN when you call us, we'll compare your voice against this stored numeric sequence.\nIf they match, your identity is confirmed, and you're transferred to one of our Associates or to an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) self-service function.\nYour voiceprint will only ever be used to confirm your identity and replaces other methods of verification such as questions asked by one of our Associates.</p>\n<p>Your unique voiceprint can't be used to reverse engineer, reuse or recreate your voice.\nYour voiceprint is encrypted and kept in our secure database.\nYour voiceprint will only be accessible by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Our employees who need the information in the performance of their duties for us,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Our affiliates, to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>resolve your concerns about any related products and services with us</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>assist in other required investigations</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Service providers who need the information in the performance of their duties for us, and to satisfy their obligations to us, and,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Anyone who is otherwise authorized by law</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nIt's your choice\n<p>You can withdraw your consent for us to use your voiceprint at any time, but doing so will prevent you from using the Voice ID system in the future, unless you re-enroll.\nThis means you'll be identified using the verification questions asked by our Associates when you call to do telephone banking.</p>\n<p>If you choose to withdraw your consent for any reason, your voiceprint will be de-activated and retained as required or permitted by law.</p>\n<p>Back to Top</p> ",

commentary.</strong>\n</p>\n1.\nTIFL\u2019s Accountability\n<br>\n<p>TIFL is accountable for all personal information in its possession or control, including any personal information transferred to third parties for processing.\nTIFL has established policies and procedures to comply with this Privacy Code, and has designated one or more persons accountable for compliance.</p>\n2.\nIdentifying the Purposes of Collecting Personal Information\n<br>\n<p>TIFL will inform individuals of the purpose for which personal information will be used before or when they consent to its collection.</p>\n3.\nObtaining Consent\n<br>\n<p>TIFL will obtain consent before or when it collects, uses or discloses personal information about an individual.</p>\n<p>An individual can provide consent to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information about them expressly, implicitly, or through an authorized representative.\nAn individual can withdraw consent at any time, with certain exceptions.</p>\n<p>TIFL will collect, use or disclose personal information without an individual\u2019s consent only in limited circumstances as permitted by law.</p>\n4.\nLimits for Collecting Personal Information\n<br>\n<p>TIFL limits the amount and type of personal information it collects.\nTIFL will collect personal information only for the identified purposes or as otherwise permitted by law.</p>\n5.\nLimits for Using, Disclosing and Keeping Personal Information\n<br>\n<p>TIFL will use or disclose personal information only for the reasons it was collected, unless an individual gives consent to use or disclose it for another reason.</p>\n<p>Under certain circumstances, TIFL may have a legal duty or right to disclose personal information without consent.</p>\n<p>TIFL will keep personal information only as long as necessary for the identified purposes.</p>\n6.\nKeeping Personal Information Accurate\n<br>\n<p>TIFL will keep the personal information in its possession or control accurate, complete, current and relevant, based on the most recent information available to TIFL.</p>\n<p>Individuals may challenge the accuracy and completeness of personal information about them and have it amended as appropriate.</p>\n7.\nSafeguarding Personal Information\n<br>\n<p>TIFL protects personal information with safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.</p>\n8.\nMaking Information about Policies and Procedures Available\n<br>\n<p>TIFL will be open about the procedures used to manage personal information.\nIndividuals will have access to information about these procedures through this Privacy Code, by contacting our Investment Fund Associates or by contacting the Privacy Office.\nThe information will be available in a format that is easy to understand.</p>\n9.\nProviding Access to Personal Information\n<br>\n<p>When an individual requests it, when possible, TIFL will advise the individual what personal information TIFL has in its possession or control about the individual, what it is being used for, and to whom it has been disclosed.</p>\n<p>When an individual requests it, TIFL will give an individual access to personal information about them which is in the possession or control of TIFL.\nIn certain situations, however, TIFL may not be able to give individuals access to all of their personal information.</p>\n10.\nHandling Complaints and Questions\n<br>\n<p>Individuals may challenge TIFL\u2019s compliance with this Privacy Code.\nComplaints and inquiries should be directed to our Investment Fund Associates or sent to the Privacy Office.</p> Principle 1\nTIFL\u2019s Accountability\n<p>\n<strong>TIFL is accountable for all personal information in its possession or control, including any personal information transferred to third parties for processing.\nTIFL has established procedures to comply with this Privacy Code, and has designated one or more persons to be accountable for compliance.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>1.1 Senior management of TIFL will have ultimate accountability for protecting personal information.\nSenior management has delegated the day-to-day management of procedures involving personal information protection to one or more persons.</p>\n<p>1.2 TIFL\u2019s Privacy Office is responsible for overall personal information protection and TIFL\u2019s compliance with this Privacy Code.\nIn addition, Investment Fund Associates are able to respond to most inquiries about the protection of personal information.</p>\n<p>1.3 Tangerine Investment Funds Limited will allow the following categories of employees of TIFL\u2019s parent, Tangerine Bank, to access individuals\u2019 personal information in TIFL\u2019s control:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sales and Service Personnel;</li>\n<li>Marketing Personnel;</li>\n<li>Audit Personnel;</li>\n<li>Security Personnel;</li>\n<li>IT Personnel;</li>\n<li>Operations Personnel;</li>\n<li>Legal Compliance Personnel;</li>\n<li>Risk Management Personnel.\nand</li>\n<li>Credit and Lending Personnel.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p>1.4 TIFL is also accountable for personal information that has been transferred to a third party for processing.\nTIFL\u2019s policy for safeguarding personal information transferred to third parties is set out in Section 7.4 of this Privacy Code.</p>\n<p>1.5 To practice the principles of this Privacy Code, TIFL:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>1.5.1 has established procedures to protect the privacy of personal information;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>1.5.2 has established procedures to receive and respond to questions and complaints;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>1.5.3 gives the public access to this Privacy Code.\nand</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>1.5.4 has trained TIFL staff to understand and follow TIFL\u2019s procedures.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>TIFL also oversees compliance with this Privacy Code through regular audits and other compliance procedures.\nSenior management reports to a committee of its Board of Directors regarding compliance with this Privacy Code.</p>\n<br> Principle 2\nIdentifying the Purposes of Collecting Personal Information\n<p>\n<strong>TIFL will identify the purposes of collecting personal information, before or when consent is provided.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>2.1.\nExcept as noted below, when an individual applies for a product or service, TIFL will make the individual aware of the purposes for which TIFL is requesting the personal information.\nIf TIFL identifies other purposes for which the personal information may be used, TIFL will seek the individual\u2019s consent prior to starting these uses.\nTIFL will explain that it is the individual\u2019s right to refuse permission for TIFL to use personal information for any such other purposes.</p>\n<p>In some cases TIFL will not explain those purposes or obtain the individual\u2019s consent.\n(See Section 3.4 and Section 5.1 for details.)</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>2.2.\nTIFL will clearly identify the purposes for which it is collecting personal information in writing, verbally (either in person or over the telephone), or by any other means it communicates with individuals.</p>\n<p>2.3.\nIndividuals can ask for information about the purposes for which TIFL collects personal information when they phone or write to the Privacy Office.</p>\n<p>2.4.\nUnless additional purposes are identified to an individual before or at the time of collection, TIFL will collect personal information (which may include credit, employment and other financially related information) for the following purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>to help identify new Clients;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to determine the suitability of products or services for an individual or the eligibility of an individual for products and services;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to set up and manage TIFL\u2019s products and services offered by approved distributors that meet an individual\u2019s needs;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to offer products and services to meet those needs;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to provide ongoing service.\nand</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to meet legal and regulatory requirements, such as requirements under the Income Tax Act and credit reporting requirements.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p>2.5.\nTIFL takes care to explain purposes which are not as obvious as others.\nThe purposes for collecting a name or address are obvious and do not need to be explained, but the purposes for collecting other information may not be as self-evident.<br>TIFL may collect, disclose and use personal information for some or all of the following purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>references are used to verify information on an application;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>your date of birth (DOB) and other identifying information may be collected and used to verify your identity and to protect you and TIFL from error or fraud.\nTIFL may also collect and use personal information obtained from credit bureaus, credit reporting agencies and other financial institutions in order to help verify your identity;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a Social Insurance Number (SIN) is collected and used because the Income Tax Act requires it for an individual\u2019s income tax reporting.\nIn addition, a SIN may be used to match credit bureau information to help verify the identity of a Client;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>personal information is exchanged with credit bureaus, credit reporting agencies, credit insurers, and other financial institutions to determine eligibility for financial products.\nThe credit reporting agencies that provide your credit information to us are Equifax Canada Inc.\n(Equifax.ca) and TransUnion Canada Inc.\n(transunion.ca).\nYou can contact them to access, rectify or obtain a copy of your credit report;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>personal information is used by TIFL to determine initial and ongoing eligibility for financial products and to notify Clients of such products by mail, email or phone;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>personal information may be collected, used and disclosed to investigate Client complaints;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>personal information may be collected and used to ensure that any of your instructions can be properly verified;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>personal information is shared, to the extent permitted by law, with Tangerine Bank for the purposes of serving you better.\nFor example, we include in your Account statements, a statement for each of your Accounts held at TIFL and Tangerine Bank;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>personal information may be collected, used and disclosed to investigate specific transactions or patterns of transactions for the purpose of detecting unauthorized or illegal activities;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>if you open an Account to be operated on behalf of a third party, personal information of that third party will be collected from you in accordance with Anti-Money Laundering legislation.\nand</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>personal information may be used by TIFL and disclosed to TIFL\u2019s affiliates to satisfy regulatory reporting requirements and international banking standards for financial institutions.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p>2.6.\nThe way we analyze your personal information may involve automated decisions.\nThis involves processing your personal information using software that can evaluate your personal circumstances and other factors to address risks or outcomes.\nWe may use this method to make decisions about you relating to credit checks, identity and address checks, monitoring your Account(s) for fraud or other financial crime, or for other reasons that we\u2019ll disclose to you.\nWe may use automated decision making if it\u2019s necessary for us to provide you with a particular product (for example, we may use it to decide on the types of services that are suitable for you), to prevent fraud or financial crime, or if it\u2019s reasonable to ensure that we\u2019re treating our Clients fairly.</p> Principle 3\nObtaining Consent\n<p>\n<strong>TIFL will obtain consent before or when it collects, uses or discloses personal information about an individual.\nAn individual can provide consent to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information about them expressly, implicitly or through an authorized representative.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>TIFL will collect, use or disclose personal information without an individual\u2019s consent only in limited circumstances as permitted by law.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Subject to certain legal and contractual restrictions and reasonable notice, an individual can refuse or withdraw their consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information about them at any time.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>3.1.\nTIFL will obtain consent before or when it collects, uses or discloses personal information.\nGenerally, TIFL will seek consent to use and disclose personal information at the same time it collects the information.\nIn some circumstances, TIFL may identify a new purpose and seek consent to use and disclose personal information after it has been collected.</p>\n<p>3.2.\nTIFL will explain to individuals in plain language how personal information will be used or disclosed before they give their consent.</p>\n<p>3.3.\nConsent to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information can be expressed, implied, or given through an authorized representative of the individual.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>individuals can express consent verbally, such as when information is collected over the telephone, in writing, such as when completing and signing an application or electronically, such as when applying through a computer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>individuals can imply their consent, for example, by using a TIFL product or service.\nIn such a case, TIFL may assume that the individual consents to the use of the personal information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>individuals can also give consent through an authorized representative, such as a legal guardian or a person with Power of Attorney.\nThis may be necessary, for example, if TIFL cannot obtain express consent from an individual who is a minor, seriously ill, or mentally incapacitated.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p>3.4.\nTIFL may collect, use or disclose personal information without the individual\u2019s knowledge and consent only in limited circumstances as permitted by law.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>TIFL may collect, use and disclose personal information without the individual\u2019s knowledge or consent if it is clearly in the individual\u2019s best interests to do so and consent cannot be sought in a timely manner.\nAn example of such a circumstance is when an individual is seriously ill.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>TIFL may collect, use and disclose personal information without individuals\u2019 knowledge or consent in certain circumstances where the information is publicly available.\nAn example would be the name, address and phone number of a subscriber to a telephone directory that is available to the public where the subscriber can refuse to have their personal information appear in the telephone directory.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p>3.5.\nSubject to certain legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice, an individual may refuse or withdraw consent at any time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>TIFL will inform individuals of the consequences of refusing or withdrawing consent when individuals seek to do so.\nRefusing or withdrawing consent for TIFL to collect, use or disclose personal information could mean that TIFL cannot provide the individual with a product, service or information of value to the individual.<br>For example, if an individual does not allow TIFL to share certain personal information with a mutual fund company, TIFL may be unable to provide the individual with the products offered by that mutual fund company.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>TIFL, however, will not unreasonably withhold products, services or information from individuals who refuse to give consent or who withdraw consent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>TIFL is required by law to collect certain types of personal information in order to verify the identity of its Clients.\nIf an individual does not allow TIFL to collect and use this information, or if the Client later attempts to withdraw their consent, TIFL may not be able to open an Account or maintain the Account on behalf of that Client.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br> Principle 4\nLimits on the Collection of Personal Information\n<p>\n<strong>TIFL limits the amount and type of personal information it collects.\nTIFL will collect personal information only for purposes it has already identified to the individual or as permitted by law.\nTIFL will collect personal information using procedures which are fair and lawful.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>4.1.\nTIFL will collect only the amount and type of information needed for the purposes documented by TIFL and identified to the individual.</p>\n<p>4.2.\nTIFL will collect personal information about an individual primarily from that individual.\nExcept as permitted by law, TIFL will only collect personal information from external sources if individuals have consented to such collection.</p>\n<p>4.3.\nWhen you

from a minor, or an individual who is seriously&nbsp;ill.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We may collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent only in limited circumstances as permitted by law.\nFor&nbsp;example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We may collect, use and disclose personal information without your knowledge or consent if it is clearly in your best interest to do so and consent cannot be sought in a timely manner.\nAn example of such a circumstance is when an individual is seriously&nbsp;ill.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tangerine may collect, use and disclose personal information without your knowledge or consent in accordance with law or upon the lawful request of a government institution or part of a government institution.\nAn example would be when a government institution lawfully requests the information for the enforcement of federal or provincial Canadian law or laws of a foreign&nbsp;jurisdiction.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can refuse to consent to our collection, use or disclosure of personal information, or you may withdraw your consent to our further collection, use or disclosure of your personal information at any time by giving us reasonable notice, subject to limited exceptions.\nThis includes withdrawing your consent for the use of your SIN for identity verification&nbsp;purposes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We will inform you of the consequences of refusing or withdrawing consent.\nRefusing or withdrawing consent for Tangerine to collect, use or disclose personal information could mean that we cannot provide you with a product and/or service.\nFor example, if you do not allow us to obtain a credit report, we may not be able to lend money to&nbsp;you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We may have legal, regulatory or contractual obligations to collect, use or disclose certain of your personal information, in which case you may not withdraw your consent.\nFor example, during the term of a loan, you may not withdraw your consent to our ongoing collection, use or disclosure of your personal information in connection with the loan you have with us or have&nbsp;guaranteed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We will not unreasonably withhold products, services or information from individuals who refuse to give consent or who withdraw&nbsp;consent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tangerine is required by law to collect certain types of personal information in order to verify your identity.\nIf you do not allow us to collect and use this information, or if you later attempt to withdraw your consent, we may not be able to open or maintain an Account for&nbsp;you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Withdrawal of consent is not permitted in relation to a credit product where we must collect and report information after credit has been granted.\nThis is to maintain the integrity of the credit reporting&nbsp;system.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We will act on your instructions as quickly as possible but there may be certain uses of your information that we may not be able to stop&nbsp;immediately.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can opt out and withdraw consent.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you wish to withdraw your consent or update your marketing communication preferences, contact us toll-free at&nbsp;1-888-826-4374.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To opt out of email communications, click on the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d link

personal&nbsp;information\n<p>Tangerine limits the amount and type of personal information it collects.\nWe will collect personal information only for purposes that have been already identified to you or as permitted by&nbsp;law.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>We will only collect the amount and type of information needed for the purposes documented by us and identified to&nbsp;you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We will collect personal information about you primarily from you.\nExcept as permitted by law, Tangerine will only collect personal information from external sources if you have consented to such collection (for example, a Refer-a-Friend&nbsp;Program).</p>\n</li>\n</ol> SECTION 5\nPrinciple \u2013 Limits on using, disclosing and keeping personal&nbsp;information\n<p>We will use or disclose personal information only for the reasons it was collected, unless consent is given to use or disclose it for another purpose.\nUnder certain exceptional circumstances, we may have a legal duty or right to disclose personal information without your knowledge or&nbsp;consent.</p>\n<p>We will keep personal information only as long as necessary for the identified purposes.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>We may disclose personal information without consent when required or permitted by law.\nExamples of such disclosure&nbsp;include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>subpoenas, search warrants and other court and government&nbsp;orders;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>debt collection or demands from other parties who have a legal right to personal information;&nbsp;and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>disclosure of personal information to a lawyer (or, in Quebec, a notary or an advocate) who represents Tangerine to protect Tangerine\u2019s&nbsp;interests.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In any of the circumstances referred to above, we will protect your interests by making sure&nbsp;that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>orders or demands appear to comply with the laws under which they were&nbsp;issued;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>when permitted by law, we may notify you that an order or demand has been&nbsp;received.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We will collect health records only for specific purposes explained to you, such as establishing the effective date of a Power of Attorney or for creditor insurance purposes, as insurance providers require this personal information to assess insurance risk and to establish and administer the insurance&nbsp;coverage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the event we provide personal information to a third party service provider for processing located in a foreign jurisdiction, we will be bound by the laws and regulations of that jurisdiction and may disclose personal information in accordance with those laws and&nbsp;regulations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We will destroy, erase or make anonymous any personal information no longer needed for its identified purposes or for legal requirements, in accordance with our records retention&nbsp;policies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you fill out forms and applications online or in our Mobile Banking app, we may save your progress as a draft for up to 30 days.\nWhere possible, this means that if you can\u2019t complete the form or need to switch devices, you don\u2019t need to start over the next time you open the form.\nAfter that period, the information you entered will be deleted.</p>\n</li>\n</ol> SECTION 6\nPrinciple \u2013 Keeping personal information&nbsp;accurate\n<p>We will keep the personal information in our possession or control accurate and complete based on the most recent information available to us.\nFrom time to time, Tangerine may contact you to ask you to confirm your contact information and your marketing communication&nbsp;preferences.</p>\n<p>You may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information and have it amended as&nbsp;appropriate.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>We will make reasonable efforts to minimize the possibility of using inaccurate, incomplete or outdated personal information to make a decision about&nbsp;you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We will make reasonable efforts to keep personal information in our possession and control accurate and current if the information is used on an ongoing&nbsp;basis.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We will rely on you to keep your personal information accurate, complete and current.\nIf you demonstrate to us that personal information relating to you is inaccurate, incomplete, or out of date, we will revise or delete the personal information.\nIf necessary, we will disclose the revised personal information to any third parties to whom we had disclosed wrong or outdated information in order to permit them to revise their&nbsp;records.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If we do not agree to revise the personal information as requested by you, you may challenge our decision.\nWe will make a record of this challenge, and, if necessary, disclose the challenge by you to any third parties to whom we have disclosed the personal&nbsp;information.</p>\n</li>\n</ol> SECTION 7\nPrinciple \u2013 Safeguarding personal information\n<p>We will protect personal information with safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the&nbsp;information.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>We will safeguard personal information in our possession or control from loss or theft and from unauthorized access, disclosure, duplication, use or&nbsp;modification.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The safeguards employed by Tangerine to protect personal information will vary depending on the sensitivity, amount, distribution, format and storage of the personal information.\nWe store most of your information&nbsp;electronically.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We will safeguard personal information in our possession or control through security measures.</p>\n<p>For&nbsp;example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>physical security, such as secure locks on filing cabinets and restricted access to&nbsp;offices;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>organizational security, such as controlled entry in data centres and limited access to relevant information;&nbsp;and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>electronic security, such as passwords, personal identification numbers and&nbsp;encryption.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We may transfer personal information to third parties for processing.\nWe will require these third parties to safeguard all personal information in a way that is consistent with our principles and as required by law.\nWhen we contract with third parties, they are given only the information necessary to perform the services as set out in the contract.\nThe third parties are prohibited from storing, analyzing or using the personal information transferred by Tangerine for any other purpose.\nThe third parties are required to protect personal information transferred by Tangerine in a manner that is consistent with our privacy&nbsp;principles.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We will use care when disposing of or destroying personal
