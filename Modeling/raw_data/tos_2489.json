such use that the User makes of the same, nor shall the Owner be responsible for the User's achieving its purposes of use of the Service.\n</p> Content provided by the User <p>Users are responsible for their own content and that of third parties that they share through this Application, that they upload and post on or through this Application, or that they transfer by any other means.\nUsers

Application consists merely in providing Users with technological tools and assistance that helps them with the management of certain legal aspects of their own activities.</p>\n<p>It remains the exclusive responsibility of the User to ensure their operations are in accordance with the applicable rules.\nThe Service, in fact, should be understood as an instrument of mere support of the User and under no circumstances replace the advice given by an expert.</p>\n<p>In particular, with regard to the generation of Templates, which is carried out autonomously by the User, who remains solely responsible with regard to the verification of compliance with the Template to their activities and the provisions of law.</p>\n<p>It's the exclusive responsibility of the User to, in addition, verify the correspondence of the Template to the characteristics of their own activities such as, purely by way of example, the factual treatment of personal data of their users.</p>\n<p>In case of non-compliance of the Templates with the law and/or activity of the User, the User is obliged to refrain from using the Service.</p>\n<p>The User is authorized by this Application to use the Templates for the duration of the Service only.\nTherefore, when the Service ends, the User is obliged not to use and not to reproduce the Template provided by the Owner in any way.<br>Any reproduction in any

iubenda and its Users.</p> Purchase Purchasing process <p>Any order placed is an offer to purchase the Service.\nOrders are subject to availability and are accepted at the discretion of the Owner.\nUsers must select the desired Service, choosing the type and duration that best suit them, and check-out only after having carefully verified the information contained in the Order Summary

acceptance of the Order.\nThe contract shall be concluded at the time of the Order Confirmation by the Owner to the email address provided by the User.\nThe Owner reserves the right not to confirm an order, should one or more of the Services purchased be unavailable.\nIn this case, the Owner will notify the User about the unavailability of the Services purchased within 5 working days from order \u2013 to the email address associated with the purchase \u2013 and will provide for a refund of any amounts paid by the User.<br> To place an order, Users must register on the site providing the requested data.\nThe indicated prices include taxes, fees and charges of the law applicable.\nThe Owner reserves the right to offer discounts and various promotions throughout the year.\nFor more details on current promotions, the User is asked to contact the Owner via the contact information contained herein.</p> Recurring subscription <p>Some of the Services offered by this Application are

the time of purchase.\nThe renewed subscription will last for an equal period of time as the original service period.\nUsers may cancel automatic renewal at any time by changing their preferences for the payment method used.\nIf the User cancels an automatic renewal, then this Application may be forced to cancel their subscription when it runs out.</p> Automatic update of subscription plans <p>Some subscription plans available on this Application may be automatically updated in the event that the defined use thresholds as set forth in the User\u2019s current plan are exceeded.\nIn these cases, the subscription plan will be automatically updated to the level that fits the User\u2019s needs in order to ensure the continuity of the provision of the Service.</p>\n<p>The methods of payment used correspond to the payment method the User has chosen for subscribing to the original plan.\nThe User is obliged to check that these payment methods are valid in order to allow the automatic update of the subscription plan to function properly.\nIf the payment methods chosen by the User result unfit or unsuitable for use, the Owner may be forced to suspend the provision of the Service.</p>\n<p>The User is free to turn off this automatic upgrade feature through the Service interface or by contacting the Owner.\nIn this case, however, if the User exceeds the maximum use thresholds as set forth in the chosen subscription plan and fails to independently perform the update to the respective necessary plan, the Owner might be forced to suspend the provision of the Service.<br>\nIn any case, the Owner will attempt to do its best to alert the User via email upon approaching the maximum use thresholds and, therefore, about the need to update the current subscription plan.</p> Disabling the service, withdrawal and refund <p>Users may discontinue the Service at any time using the tools provided in the interface of this Application or by contacting the Owner directly.</p>\n<p>When disabled, Users are not allowed to claim for payments already made even if these relate to unused portions of the Service purchased.</p>\n<p>The Owner reserves the right, however, in its sole discretion and without involving charges or obligation to Users generally, to grant reimbursement in very exceptional cases after evaluating the specific circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p>In accordance with the right of withdrawal, the User may, within 14 days from the date of activation or payment of the Service, make a refund request, by sending notice to the Owner via the contact information provided in this document and including any information necessary to identify the purchase to which the claim relates.</p>\n<p>Refunds will be made within 14 days after receipt of the request using the same payment method involved during the original purchase.<br>For more information or for assistance regarding a refund request, the User is asked to contact the Owner via the contact information provided on this Application.</p> Methods of payment <p>This Application uses third-party tools for its payment processing and is not connected with any of the provided payment information \u2013 such as the credit card \u2013 in any way.<br>If the owner of any of such third-party tools refuses to authorize a payment, the Owner cannot provide the Service and will therefore not be liable for any delay or failure to deliver.</p> Duration <p>The duration of the Service is indicated at the moment of payment of the price and confirmed in the Order Confirmation email sent by the Owner.</p> Changing the payment plan <p>Users are free to change the chosen payment plan at any time.<br> In case the User modifies their current payment plan, the portion of the previous plan that has not yet been used shall be converted into a bonus which can be applied to the plan the User is switching to, on a pro-rata basis and in the form of a free period.<br> If a currency conversion is required, the exchange rate criteria set forth in the specific paragraph of the present document shall apply.</p> Currency conversion <p>The exchange rate is the one established by the payment processor.\nIn lack of such a rate, this Application will use the rate established by the European Central Bank at the moment of the relevant transaction.</p> The Service is provided \u201cas is\u201d <p>The Service is provided by the Owner \u201cas is\u201d, with no express or implied warranty for accuracy or availability.</p> Service interruption <p>The Owner reserves the right to add and remove

processing <p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes.\nNote: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (\u201copt-out\u201d), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases.\nThis, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;</li>\n<li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;</li>\n<li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;</li>\n<li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;</li>\n<li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.\n</p> Place <p>The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located.<br>\n<br>\nDepending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a country other than their own.\nTo find out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data, Users can check the section containing details about the processing of Personal Data.</p>\n<p>If broader protection standards are applicable, Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data.<br>\n<br>\nIf any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with the Owner using the information provided in the contact section.</p> Retention time <p>Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for.</p>\n<p>Therefore:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personal Data collected for purposes related to the

order of an authority.<br>\n<br>\nOnce the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted.\nTherefore, the right of access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.</p> The purposes of processing <p> The Data concerning the User is collected to allow the Owner to provide its Service, comply with its legal obligations, respond to enforcement requests, protect its rights and interests (or those of its Users or third parties), detect any malicious or fraudulent activity, as well as the following: Hosting and backend infrastructure and Traffic optimization and distribution.\n</p>\n<p>For specific information about the Personal Data used for each purpose, the User may refer to the

cookies and similar technologies.<br>\n<br>Upon the final user\u2019s first visit, the solution displays a banner through which the notice is served and the consent options are made available.\nIn particular, the final user can accept or refuse the installation of cookies and personalize the consent\u2019s preferences.<br>\n<br>If the Cookie Preference Log (\u201cCPL\u201d) is enabled, the consent preferences for the installation of cookies expressed by final users are stored in the CPL and can be retrieved at any time.<br>\n<br>When the final user navigates on a website/application where our Cookie Solution is installed, a technical cookie is injected which contains the following information:<br>\n<br>* Cookie Policy id number;<br>* consent date and time;<br>* consent content (accept/reject);<br>* how the consent has been given (banner dismissal, button click etc.).<br>\n<br>Depending on the configuration chosen, such technical cookie can be stored either on the iubenda.com domain (if the option enableRemoteConsent is active), or on the client\u2019s domain (default setting).<br>\n<br>From the above information, iubenda retrieves aggregate counters per day which indicate the number of consents given vs.\nthe totality of the consents requested, including the indication of how the consent is given.<br>\n<br>Furthermore, iubenda as data controller, processes the following access data which is strictly necessary for the technical provision of the service:<br>\n<br>* IP address;<br>* Web browser info (User Agent/type of device);<br>* Referrer (page viewed by the User) and all the information possibly available on the http header.<br>\n<br>The information outlined above, is sent to Bunny CDN which, in turn, forwards it to Akamai CDN.\nThis forwarding is done, in the case of users in the European Union, without transmitting their IP address.<br>\n<br>Further information about Akamai CDN and Bunny CDN can be found in the section \"Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data\" in the present document.<br>\n<br>The Cookie Solution is also designed to apply the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) standards, if the CCPA option is activated.\nWhen accessing a website or app, the solution displays via the banner a notice at collection of personal information which may include a DNSMPI link (\u201cDo Not Sell My Personal Information\u201d).<br>\n<br>Pursuant to the CCPA, the category of personal information collected by iubenda through the Cookie Solution is: internet information.<br>\n<br>The personal

that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity and therefore confirm the personal

disproportionate effort.</p>\n<p>Should we deny your request, we will explain you the reasons behind our denial.</p>\n<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.\nIn such cases, we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the request.\nIn either case, we will communicate our choices and explain the
