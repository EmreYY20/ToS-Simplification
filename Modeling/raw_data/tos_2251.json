<strong>\"Receiving Party\"</strong>) non-public, proprietary, or confidential information of the Disclosing Party (<strong>\u201cConfidential Information\u201d</strong>).\nConfidential Information includes any information that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure, including non-public business, product, technology and marketing information.\nConfidential Information does not include any information that: (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of the Receiving Party's breach of this Section 13.\n(ii) is or becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a third-party source, provided that such third party is not and was not prohibited from disclosing such Confidential Information.\n(iii) was in the Receiving Party's possession prior to the Disclosing Party's disclosure thereof.\nor (iv) was or is independently developed by the Receiving Party without using any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information.</p>13.2 Protection and Use of Confidential Information<p>The Receiving Party shall: (i) protect and safeguard the confidentiality of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care as the Receiving Party would protect its own Confidential Information, but in no event with less than a commercially-reasonable degree of care.\n(ii) only use the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, and only permit it to be accessed or used, for the purpose of exercising its rights or performing its obligations under these Terms, for the purpose of exploring a business relationship (or changes to the business relationship) between the parties, or for any other purpose consistent with the Privacy Policy.\nand (iii) not disclose any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information to any person or entity, except to the Receiving Party's service providers or financial/legal advisors who need to know the Confidential Information and are bound to confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those in these Terms.</p>13.3 Compelled Access or Disclosure<p>If the Receiving Party is required by applicable law or legal process to disclose any Confidential Information, it shall, prior to making such disclosure, use commercially-reasonable efforts to notify the Disclosing Party of such requirements to afford the Disclosing Party the opportunity to seek, at the Disclosing Party's sole cost and expense, a protective order or other remedy.</p>13.4 Injunctive Relief<p>Each of the parties to these Terms acknowledges that the other party will be irreparably harmed if Confidential Information of the other is distributed in breach of this Section, and that such other party would not have an adequate remedy at law in the event of such an actual or threatened breach.\nTherefore, each of the parties agrees that the other party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief against any actual or threatened breaches of this Section by the other party without the necessity of showing actual damages or showing that monetary damages would not afford an adequate remedy.</p>14.\nGoverning Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver14.1 Governing Law<p>You agree that: (i) we will be deemed solely domiciled in the State of California.\nand (ii) our Service will be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California.\nThese Terms will be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.\nThe parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce.\nNotwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1-16) ( \u201c<strong>FAA</strong>\u201d) governs the interpretation and enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement in Section 14.2 and preempts all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law.\nIf the FAA is determined not to apply to any issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under and governed by the law of your state of residence.\nThe application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\nYou agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in San Francisco, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration Agreement below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm.\nYou agree that San Francisco, California is the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration

PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.</strong> This section 14.2 (the \u201c<strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>\u201d) applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and us that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (a) these Terms, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof.\n(b) access to or use of our Service, including receipt of any advertising, marketing, or other communications from us.\n(c) any transactions through, by, or using our Service.\nor (d) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with us, directly or indirectly, as a user or consumer (\u201c<strong>Claim</strong>\u201d or collectively, \u201c<strong>Claims</strong>\u201d).\nThe Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your consent to these Terms.</p>\n<p>If you are a new user, you can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement within thirty (30) days of accepting these Terms by emailing us at legal@airtable.com with your first and last name and stating your intent to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement.\nOpting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect the binding nature of any other part of these Terms, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought.</p>\n<p>For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at legal@airtable.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.\nIn the unlikely event that we have not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any Claim through binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS (the \u201c<strong>Rules</strong>\u201d), except as provided herein.\nJAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com, where the Rules are available.\nIn the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement shall control.\nThe arbitration will be conducted in the U.S.\ncounty where you live or San Francisco, California, unless you and we agree otherwise.\nIf you are using Airtable for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.\nIf you are an individual using Airtable for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS.\n(ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.\nand (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process.\nAny judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nYou and we agree that the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.\nThe arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, is unconscionable or illusory or any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.</p>\n<p>NOTHING IN THIS SECTION WILL BE DEEMED AS PREVENTING US FROM SEEKING INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FROM THE COURTS AS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE ACTUAL OR THREATENED INFRINGEMENT, MISAPPROPRIATION, OR VIOLATION OF OUR DATA SECURITY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.\nOR PREVENTING YOU FROM ASSERTING CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY AND SO LONG AS THE MATTER REMAINS IN SUCH COURT AND ADVANCES ON ONLY AN INDIVIDUAL (NON-CLASS, NON-COLLECTIVE, AND NON-REPRESENTATIVE) BASIS.</p>\n<p>IF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO BE VOID, UNENFORCEABLE, OR UNLAWFUL, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, THE VOID, UNENFORCEABLE, OR UNLAWFUL PROVISION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, SHALL BE SEVERED.\nSEVERANCE OF THE VOID, UNENFORCEABLE, OR UNLAWFUL PROVISION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, SHALL HAVE NO IMPACT ON THE REMAINING PROVISIONS OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, WHICH SHALL REMAIN IN FORCE, OR THE PARTIES\u2019 ABILITY TO COMPEL ARBITRATION OF ANY REMAINING CLAIMS ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS PURSUANT TO THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.\nNOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IF THE CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER IS FOUND TO BE VOID, UNENFORCEABLE, OR UNLAWFUL, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, BECAUSE IT WOULD PREVENT YOU FROM SEEKING PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, THEN ANY DISPUTE REGARDING THE ENTITLEMENT TO SUCH RELIEF (AND ONLY THAT RELIEF) MUST BE SEVERED FROM ARBITRATION AND MAY BE LITIGATED IN A CIVIL COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.\nALL OTHER CLAIMS FOR RELIEF SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION UNDER THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT SHALL BE ARBITRATED UNDER ITS TERMS, AND THE PARTIES AGREE THAT LITIGATION OF ANY DISPUTE REGARDING THE ENTITLEMENT TO PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF SHALL BE STAYED PENDING THE OUTCOME OF ANY INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION.</p>14.3 Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver<p>WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED OUR SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES\u2019 INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nTHIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON\u2019S CLAIMS.\nYOU AND WE AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).\nANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER USERS.\nYOU AND WE AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.</p>15.\nU.S.\nGovernment and Other Governmental Entity Rights<p>This Section 15 applies if you are a \u201c<strong>Governmental Entity</strong>\u201d, defined as the United
