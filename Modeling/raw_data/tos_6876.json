ownership rights in content or intellectual property that you share with the website, such as your account information and content you submit to the website.\nNothing in these terms gives you any ownership rights in the operator\u2019s content or intellectual property, either.</p>\n<p>Between you and the operator, you remain solely responsible for content you submit to the website.\nYou agree not to wrongly imply that content you submit to the website is from, sponsored by, or approved by the operator.\nThese terms do not obligate the operator to store, maintain, or provide copies of content you submit.</p>\n<p>Content you submit to the website belongs to you, and you decide how to license it to others.\nBut at a minimum, you license the operator to provide content that you submit to the website to other users of the website.\nThat special license allows the operator to copy, publish, and analyze content you submit to the website.</p>\n<p>When content you submit is removed from the website, whether by you or by the operator, the operator\u2019s special license ends when the last copy disappears from the operator\u2019s backups, caches, and other systems.\nOther licenses you give for your content may continue after your content is removed.\nThose licenses may give others, or the operator itself, the right to share your content through the website again.</p>\n<p>Others who receive content you submit to the website may violate the terms on which you license your content.\nYou agree that the operator will not be liable to you for those violations or their consequences.</p>\n<p>Your Responsibility</p>\n<p>You agree to reimburse the operator for all the costs of legal claims by others related to your breach of these terms, or breach of these terms by others using your account.\nBoth you and the operator agree to notify the other side of any legal claims you might have to reimburse the operator for as soon as possible.\nIf the operator fails to notify you of a legal claim promptly, you won\u2019t have to reimburse the operator for costs that you could have defended against or lessened with prompt notice.\nYou agree to allow the operator to take over investigation, defense, and settlement of legal claims you would have to reimburse the operator for, and to cooperate with those efforts.\nThe operator agrees not to enter any settlement that admits you were at fault or requires you to do anything without your permission.</p>\n<p>Disclaimers</p>\n<p>You accept all risk of using the website and it content.\nAs far as the law allows, the operator provides the website and its content as is, without any warranty whatsoever.</p>\n<p>The website may hyperlink to and integrate websites and services run by others.\nThe operator does not make any warranty about services run by others, or content they may provide.\nUse of services run by others may be governed by other terms between you and the one running service.</p>\n<p>Limits on Liability</p>\n<p>The operator will not be liable to you for breach-of-contract damages operator personnel could not have reasonably foreseen when you agreed to these terms.</p>\n<p>As far as the law

feedback and suggestions for the website.\nSee Contact.</p>\n<p>You agree that the operator will be free to act on feedback and suggestions you provide, and that the operator won\u2019t have to notify you that your feedback was used, get your permission to use it, or pay you for it.\nYou agree not to submit feedback or suggestions that you believe might be confidential or proprietary, to you or others.</p>\n<p>Termination</p>\n<p>Either you or the operator may end this agreement at any time.\nWhen this agreement ends, your permission to use the website also ends.</p>\n<p>The following sections continue after this agreement ends: Your Content, Feedback, Your Responsibility, Disclaimers, Limits on Liability, and General Terms.</p>\n<p>Disputes</p>\n<p>The governing law will govern these terms and all legal proceedings related to these terms or your use of the website.\nIf the operator doesn\u2019t say what the governing law is, it\u2019s the law under which the operator\u2019s legal entity is formed.\nIf the operator doesn\u2019t have a legal entity, it\u2019s the law of the state where the operator is based.</p>\n<p>Both sides agree to bring legal any proceedings related to this agreement only in the national and any national-subdivision courts located in the forum for disputes.\nIf the operator doesn\u2019t say what the forum for disputes is, it\u2019s the city with state and federal courts in the state of the governing law that is closest to where the operator is based.\nIf the operator isn\u2019t based in that state, the forum for disputes is the capital of that state.</p>\n<p>Neither you nor the operator will object to jurisdiction, forum, or venue in those courts.</p>\n<p>If the governing law allows, both sides waive their rights to trial by jury.</p>\n<p>Both sides agree to bring any legal claims related to this agreement as individuals, not as part of a class action or other representative proceeding.</p>\n<p>General Terms </p>\n<p>If a section of these terms is unenforceable as written, but could be changed to make it enforceable, that section should be changed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.\nOtherwise, that section should be removed, and the others should be enforced as written.</p>\n<p>You may not assign this agreement.\nThe operator may assign this agreement to any affiliate of the operator, any other company that obtains control of the operator, or any other company that buys assets of the operator related to the website.\nAny attempt to assign against these terms has no legal effect.</p>\n<p>Neither the exercise of any right under this agreement, nor waiver of any breach of this agreement, waives any other breach of this agreement.</p>\n<p>These terms, plus the terms on any page incorporating them by reference, are all the terms of agreement between you and the operator about use of the website.\nThis agreement entirely replaces any other agreements about your use of the website, written or not.</p>\n<p>Contact</p>\n<p>You may notify the operator under these terms, and send questions to the operator, using the contact information they provide.</p>\n<p>The operator may notify you under these terms using the e-mail address you provide for your account on the website, or by posting a message to the homepage of the website or your account page.</p>\n<p>Changes</p>\n<p>The operator may update the terms of service for the website.\nThe operator will post all updates to the website.\nFor updates with substantial changes, the operator agrees to e-mail you if you\u2019ve created an account and provided a valid e-mail address.\nThe operator may also announce updates with special messages or alerts on the website.</p>\n<p>Once you get notice of an update to these terms, you must agree to the new terms in order to keep using the website.</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "created_at": "2022-11-15 05:18:56.694455", "updated_at": "2022-11-15
