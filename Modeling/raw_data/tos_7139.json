these objectives, SlideShare provides a process for submission of complaints concerning content posted by our Users.\nOur policy and procedures are described and/or referenced in the sections that follow.</p>\n<p>Please note that whether or not we disable access to or remove content, SlideShare may make a good faith attempt to forward the written notification, including the complainant\u2019s contact information, to the User who posted the content and/or take other reasonable steps to notify the User that SlideShare has received notice of an alleged violation of intellectual property rights or other content violation.\nIt is also our policy, in appropriate circumstances and in our discretion, to disable and/or terminate the accounts of Users, or groups as the case may be, who infringe or repeatedly infringe the rights of others or otherwise post unlawful content.</p>\n<p>Please note that any notice or counter-notice you submit must be truthful and must be submitted under

removes content upon receipt of a valid DMCA notification.\nScribd notifies the uploading member at the email address on file immediately upon the content\u2019s removal.\nScribd members can appeal a DMCA notification through a process called counter-notification.</p>\n<p>If you believe that a DMCA notification sent to Scribd was in error, you must send Scribd a communication that contains the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.</li>\n<li>A statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.</li>\n<li>The subscriber\u2019s name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that the subscriber consents to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if the subscriber\u2019s address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Scribd may be found, and that the subscriber will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under subsection (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person.</li>\n<li>A physical or electronic signature of the subscriber.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Scribd will forward your counter-notification to the original complainant.\nScribd is not authorized to mediate or adjudicate your dispute with the complainant.</p>\n<p>Once the complainant receives your counter-notification, they can choose to resolve the issue with you directly, voluntary rescind their complaint, or ignore your counter-notification.\nScribd can then restore the content to the site once the complainant rescinds their notification or if they ignore your counter-notification for more than fourteen (14) days,</p>\n<p>Counter-notifications can be sent by mail to:</p>\n<code>Scribd, Inc.<br>Attn: Scribd DMCA copyright infringement notification<br>460 Bryant Street, #100<br>San Francisco, CA
