Conditions (referred to as the \u201cSurvey Terms\u201d) set forth the terms of an Agreement by which You, (the \u201cParticipant\u201d) and Privax Limited, with its registered office at \"110 High Holborn, 7th Floor, London, WC1V 6JS England, ID No.\n07207304, and its affiliates (\u201cPrivax\u201d), may participate from to time in any subsequent Privax online product surveys, and as further defined in section 4 below (\u201cSurvey\u201d).\nIn the event You are younger than 18 years of age, you may not be a Participant.\nPrivax reserves the right to change these Survey Terms, modify or end the Survey program, at any time without notice.</li>\n<li>2.\nParticipant is responsible for all local sales tax, VAT, levies, bank charges and any other applicable taxes or charges that may apply to any remuneration (defined in section 6 below as \u201cReward\u201d) that may be received by Participant for his/her participation in a Survey.</li>\n<li>3.\nThese Survey Terms govern the Participant\u2019s option to participate in a Survey and Privaxs corresponding obligation to pay the agreed fee to the Participant for such Survey participation.</li>\n<li>4.\nSurvey refers to the gathering of feedback from the Participant relating to Privax and its competitors\u2019 products and services.\nThe Survey(s) may help to generate ideas concerning the enhancement of the end user experience which may ultimately benefit Privax\u2019s (and its parents\u2019 and affiliates\u2019) wider-customer base.\nSuch Surveys shall be conducted either by means of the telephone or through an online interface.</li>\n<li>5.\nAvailable Survey(s), including the relevant Reward amount, shall be announced via email to the Participant.\nIt is the Participant\u2019s decision whether or not to participate in any such Survey.</li>\n<li>6.\nFor each properly completed Survey, Privax shall provide the Participant a single compensatory reward (\u201cReward\u201d).\nThe Reward is the sole and exclusive compensation available to the Participant and therefore the Participant is not entitled to any other remuneration or reimbursement, including for possible expenses, or otherwise in relation to the Survey.</li>\n<li>7.\nBy accepting the Survey Terms, the Participant authorizes Privax to gather and process their personal data in accordance with the applicable Privacy Policy and in these Survey Terms, for the period of duration of this Agreement until either of the parties of the Agreement will terminate it, the Participant\u2019s personal data to the following extent: first name, surname, email address, telephone number or other personal data provided by the Participant to Privax for the purposes of carrying out the Survey, the Survey assessment and sending of informative messages by Privax concerning the Survey, as well as the assessment interviews performed by Privax and to administer the Reward.\nUpon acceptance of the Survey Terms, a confirmation email will be dispatched to the email address of the Participant with relevant information and link to the applicable Privax Privacy Policy.\nThe Participant\u2019s provision of his/her personal data is voluntary.\nIn the event that the Participant does not provide the necessary personal data, this will have no effect (negative or otherwise) on their existing relationship with Privax, if any, but in the event that the Participant does not provide this personal data, it will not be possible for them to participate in the Survey or claim the Reward.\nThe Participant can terminate this Agreement at any time by providing an email notice to dpo@Privax.com containing the request to terminate this Agreement.</li>\n<li>8.\nBy accepting the Survey Terms, the Participant acknowledges that Privax, in accordance with the applicable Privax Privacy Policy and these Survey Terms will use the Participant\u2019s email address and telephone number for the purposes of Privax communicating with the Participant in connection with the Survey, in particular, send informative messages from Privax to the Participant concerning the Survey, its organization, proceedings and other communication necessary in order to carry out the Survey and facilitate the Participant\u2019s involvement in the Survey.\n</li>\n<li>9.\nAny information provided to the Participant, whether directly or to which access is gained, during or as a result of the Survey shall be kept confidential by the Participant.\nThe Participant shall not engage in the dissemination or publication of any such confidential information as this might subject Privax to damage to Privax or be detrimental to Avast\u2019s goodwill.\nThis duty of confidentiality is perpetually binding upon the Participant.\nThe Participant shall not use the confidential facts and information to their advantage or to the advantage of third parties.\nIf the Participant breaches the confidentiality provisions of this Section, the Participant shall pay Privax a contractual penalty of USD 25,000.\nThe payment of the contractual penalty does not affect Privax\u2019s claim for additional damages.</li>\n<li>10.\nIn the event any documents, instructions, discs or other media, lists, guides, aids, plans, software and other materials, items and recorded information are provided to the Participant in relation to the Survey (\u201cMaterials\u201d), the Participant shall return to Privax all such Materials upon Survey completion.</li>\n<li>11.\nThe Participant acknowledges that due to the fact that Privax is a member of the Avast corporate group, which operates on a global scale, their personal data may be transferred to other Privax affiliates (Avast affiliates) located in countries outside of the European Economic Area, which may provide a different level of protection to personal data than the country in which they are located.\nAs a data subject under applicable data protection law, the Participant has the right to information about the processing of their personal data, the right of access to personal data, and the right to rectification and erasure of personal data or restriction of processing.\nThe Participant also has the right to object to the processing of personal data as well as the right to data portability.\nThe Participant also has the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority.\nIn the event that the Participant has any questions about how Privax uses their personal data or wishes to exercise a right on your personal data under applicable law, you may contact Privax at dpo@privax.com.\nIt is also possible to send paper mail to Privax parent company, Avast Software s.r.o., Pikrtova 1737/1a, 140 00, Prague 4, Czech Republic, marked with \"Attention: PRIVACY\" in the address.\nPrivax has appointed a Data Protection Officer whom you can contact by sending an email to dpo@privax.com.By accepting these Survey Terms, the Participant acknowledges the applicable Privax Privacy Policy (as specified above) and confirms that they have read it.</li>\n<li>12.\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the Czech Republic.\nAll disputes arising from this Agreement will be resolved by the Czech courts having local jurisdiction and jurisdiction in rem.</li>\n</ul> Need to talk to someone?

Application Events<br>\n<br>Events such as auto-connection, uninstall event, etc.\ntogether with an internal identifier (\u201capplication event identifier\u201d) To plan product development and analytics<br>\n<br>Example: How many users do we have? Is a new client-side feature we introduced popular? Are people uninstalling after our latest release? Crash reports generated and sent by the user<br>\n<br>We might collect data like your e-mail, app version or internal identifiers described above.\nTo help troubleshoot the issue.\nWe don\u2019t send any privacy-sensitive data automatically - you need to explicitly allow sending this back to us and check prior to what data is being sent before you share it with us.<br>\n<br>Please note that if you provide us together with information above also your personal data, e.g.\nwithin an ad hoc crash report that you decide to send to us, we could add this information to the service data and might be able to connect it with you.<br>\n<br>Example: App is crashing on some specific device.\nThis is how customer care support can help with device-specific issues.\n<p>\n<b>We store client\u2019s service data for 2 years</b>, after which time it is deleted on a rolling basis \u2014 data created on Jan 3rd, 2019 gets deleted on Jan 3rd, 2021, for example.</p>\n<p>Note: if you are using an older version of HMA, our apps may be configured to collect your username.\nWhile we have set our servers to immediately dump this information for all versions of clients, this is still a potential risk to your privacy.\nThe only way to resolve this is to upgrade your VPN app/service to the latest versions.</p> Account creation and management <p>When you create an account with us (note: this is necessary in order for you to use the VPN service), we will need some information about you.\nThis is the personal data that is created and stored for the management of your account:</p> Account data What we use it for Email address To send you purchase receipts, communications, and occasional product news Username (only for legacy versions) To manage your account and facilitate your login into the service.\nWe do not collect this information anymore.\nUsernames are used only with older versions of our VPN clients.\nActivation code To activate your subscription Subscription renewal date To tell us until when the account is valid <p>All of the above data is stored for as long as you use our service, as it is necessary for us to provide it.\nHowever, your Account Data is not paired with your activity usage.\nYou can see all of this data by logging into our Privacy Preference portal.</p> Billing and Payment <p>We rely on third-party payment processors to handle your product purchases.\nYou can find out which provider we are working with for the point of purchase you chose (for example our website, an app store, etc) by looking at your transactional email or receipt.</p>\n<p>This is the list of payment processors we cooperate with and their privacy policies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2Checkout - https://www.2checkout.com/legal/privacy/</li>\n<li>Google Play - https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US</li>\n<li>Apple iTunes - https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These providers are in the position of independent controllers and may collect a variety of information about you to complete the purchase.\nAll of them are PCI-compliant or the equivalent and are prohibited from using your personal data for anything but facilitating your payment and subscription management or as otherwise described in their applicable terms of service and privacy policy.</p>\n<p>Some of that billing data may be shared with us in order to detect and prevent fraud, help with customer support, or used as a record of your payment for accounting, taxation, and invoicing purposes.\nThis data is what we call \u201cbilling data\u201d and it includes your name, address, email address, the product (subscription you purchased) and for how long, and payment information.</p>\n<p>Your payment provider will process your credit card number, but it is not shared with us.</p>\n<p>On our side, billing data is stored for as long as you continue to use our service, and for up to 10 years after that.\nIf legal obligations change, or we need to resolve disputes and enforce our agreements, we may be obliged to keep this data longer than that.</p> Communication The Email <p>If you contact us by email, it will be stored for 6 months, unless required by law or other exceptional circumstances.\nWe do this to speed up our turn around on support and to follow up.\n</p>\n<p>If you are a user of our service or you have subscribed on our website, we will send you such commercial communications through this channel in the form of newsletters, or blog notifications.\nPlease note, if you don\u2019t want to be on our mailing list, you may use the \u201cUnsubscribe\u201d link available in every communication we send you.</p> Livechat <p>When you use our Livechat functionality, we also store the message for 6 months.\nOur Livechat functionality is provided by Zopim (a ZenDesk subsidiary), which may also collect some data subject to their security policy and privacy policy.</p>\n<p>Please note that if you provide us with your personal data we might be able to connect the collected service data with you.</p> Third-party tools used for analytics <p>To analyze application events from our VPN clients in order to understand how our services function, or how stable or successful they are, we rely on our own analytics tools as much as possible.\nHere are the third-party tools we use, how we use them, and their privacy policies:</p> Microsoft App Center on macOS.\n<p>Microsoft App Center (former HockeyApp) on older versions of our macOS and iOS apps: This was used to do beta distribution, crash reporting, user metrics, feedback, and more.\nThis tool belongs to Microsoft and you can find their privacy policy here.</p> Google Firebase Analytics on iOS and Android <p>Firebase helps us to understand how people interact with certain aspects of our service.\nWhile Firebase normally relies on Android Advertising ID or iOS Identifier for Advertisers, this is not the case of our service because we\u2019ve opted to use our own anonymizing identifiers instead.</p>\n<p>As this tool is not necessary for service functioning, you can opt-out of providing us with this anonymized application performance data in our application settings.</p> Google Fabric Crashlytics on iOS and Android <p>This Google tool helps us to improve application stability, pinpoint things that don\u2019t work, and improve your experience.\nIts implementation doesn\u2019t contain any information that can personally identify you.</p>\n<p>Both Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics are subject to Google\u2019s privacy policies</p> Deprecated Analytics <p>If you\u2019re still on older versions of our service, the following analytics are embedded in them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facebook Analytics on older versions of our Android apps: we used to use this to know how many people opened an app, how much time they spent in it, and other information about how they interacted with them.\nYou can find Facebook\u2019s privacy policy here.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We highly recommend that you upgrade to later versions.</p> Extensions Privacy Policy <p>As an optional part of the VPN service, we offer the following free extensions.</p>\n<p>Please read Common Information for overall information about who are we.\nFor other products and services please visit Extensions Privacy Policy, and for information on how we

Unblocker <p>The proxy extension is provided as a free tool for online privacy protection.\nBecause of that, we need to gather different data to protect our product from abuse.</p> What personal data Free HMA VPN Proxy Unblocker processes? <p>If you use the free HMA VPN Proxy Unblocker for Chrome and Firefox browsers, this is the personal data that gets collected:</p> Service data What we use it

network.<br>\n<br>Example: If someone attempts to attack our servers, we may report the attacker to their ISP or law enforcement.\n<p>We delete all of this data <b>every 30 days</b> on a rolling basis so data created on January 3rd gets deleted on February 2nd, for example.</p>\n<p>On the client extension side, we collect data to understand how people are using the extension, troubleshoot it, and plan development.\nNone of this can be used to specifically identify you.</p> Client data What we use it for User Agent<br>E.g.Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh.\nIntel Mac OS X 10_14) For user support, troubleshooting, and product development planning<br>\n<br>Example: Help us troubleshoot issues with specific configurations.\nApplication Events<br>\n<br>E.g.\nUser has used Panic Mode feature,

CCleaner (including Defraggler, Recuva and Speccy) and HMA Solutions that end users purchase directly from us through our online retail stores or through Google Play.\n&nbsp;If your purchase qualifies, and you follow all the instructions in this Cancellation and Refund Policy within 30 days of the date of purchase, we will terminate your subscription and refund 100% of the price you paid for the then current Subscription Term.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>We also allow you to cancel your subscription and request a refund (prorated for the unexpired or unused portion of the Subscription Term) if we provide notice to you that we are amending the End User License Agreement we entered into with you in respect of such subscription and/or Solution (the \u201cEULA\u201d), and you object to such amendment within 30 days of the date of such notice.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If your subscription is conditioned on you paying a fee or charge, and if we have not received payment by the 15th

us.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Requesting a Cancellation and Refund from Us.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Before you start, please read all the restrictions and limitations described in this Cancellation and Refund Policy.\n&nbsp;If you qualify for a cancellation and refund on your purchase, and you purchased the subscription directly from us through our online retail store or from Google Play, then please follow the instructions below:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Products Purchased from Us and Subscriptions You Terminate for Notified Amendments to the EULA.\n&nbsp;To request a cancellation and refund for a subscription you purchased from us through our online retail stores, or to terminate a subscription because you object to an amendment to the EULA we have notified to you, please find the confirmation email or invoice we sent directly to you in connection with your purchase, because it will tell you which Avast company you will need to contact (which may not be the brand name on the Solution) and will contain certain other information you must provide us in order to request your cancellation and refund.\n&nbsp;Then, click on the link below and follow the instructions on the linked

subscription and/or Solution you purchased from a physical bricks-and-mortar store, the iTunes app store or any other reseller (not mentioned above), rather than directly from us, please contact the reseller regarding its cancellation and refund policy and any request for a refund.\n&nbsp;We do not grant refunds on those purchases.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Restrictions Regarding Hardware.\n&nbsp;If you purchased hardware (for example, Avast Omni hub) you must first return the hardware before initiating the refund process.\n&nbsp;Please contact our support team&nbsp;for explanation and assistance

entered into with respect to a prior version of the Solution.</p>\n<p>Vendor may amend this Agreement at any time by notice provided to you in accordance with this Agreement, and your continued use of any affected Solution at any point at least 30 days after the notice date will constitute your acceptance of the amendment of this Agreement.\nVendor may require that you accept the amended Agreement in order to continue using any affected Solution you have previously acquired.\nIf you decline to accept the amended Agreement, Vendor may terminate your use of such affected Solution, in which case you may obtain a refund for the portion of the subscription fee you have paid for the unexpired or unused portion of the Subscription Period by following the instructions found here.</p> 1.\nLicense

long the subsequent Subscription Period will last.</p>\n<p>2A.2 Unless otherwise cancelled, the Distributor will attempt to take payment from you (using your saved credit card or bank account details), for the subsequent Subscription Period, up to thirty (30) days in advance of the renewal date.</p>\n<p>2A.3 To the extent payment is unable to be taken on the first attempt, the Distributor

will receive a confirmation email which shall include all the key information in respect of your automatic renewal and the duration of the subsequent Subscription Period.</p>\n<p>2A.5 You are entitled to switch-off the auto-renewal of your subscription using the process notified to you during the order process for the subscription, meaning that your subscription will come to an end when the then current Subscription Period expires.\nOnce you have elected to cancel the auto-renewal of your subscription, auto-renewal will remain cancelled unless you subsequently agree to a new subscription.</p>\n<p>2A.6 If your subscription auto-renews, you may cancel that renewal no later than 30 days following such renewal date.\nIf the Distributor has taken payment for the next Subscription Period (\u201c<i>Renewal Payment</i>\u201d) then you will receive a full refund of the Renewal Payment.</p> 3.\nUpdates <p>Vendor, from time to time during the Subscription Period and without your separate permission or consent, may from time to time deploy an upgrade or update of, or replacement for, any Solution (\u201c<i>Update</i>\u201d), and as a result of any such deployment you may not be able to use the applicable Solution or Device (or certain functions of the Device) until any such Update is fully installed or activated.\nEach Update will be deemed to form a part of the \u201cSolution\u201d for all purposes under this Agreement.\nUpdates may include both additions to, and removal of, any particular features or functionality offered by a Solution or may replace it entirely, and Vendor will determine the content, features and functionality of the updated Solution in its sole discretion.\nVendor is not required to offer you the option to decline or delay Updates but, in any event, you may need to download and permit installation or activation of all available Updates to obtain maximum benefit from the Solution.\nVendor may stop providing support for a Solution until you have accepted and installed or activated all Updates.\nVendor in its sole discretion will determine when and if Updates are appropriate and has no obligation to make any Updates available to you.\nVendor in its sole discretion may stop providing Updates for any version of the Solution other than the most current version, or Updates supporting use of the Solution in connection with any versions of operating systems, email programs, browser programs and other software with which the Solution is designed to operate.</p> 4.\nOwnership rights <p>4.1.\nThe Solutions and Documentation are the intellectual property of Vendor and are protected by applicable copyright laws, international treaty provisions and other applicable laws of the country in which the Solution is being used.\nThe structure, organization and computer code of any Software and firmware are valuable trade secrets and confidential information of Vendor.\nTo the extent you provide any comments or suggestions about the Solution to Vendor, you grant Vendor the right and license to retain and use any such comments or suggestions for any purpose in its current or future products or services, without further compensation to you and without your approval of such retention or use.</p>\n<p>4.2.\nExcept as stated in this Agreement, your possession, use of a Solution does not grant you any rights or title to any intellectual property rights in the Solution or Documentation.\nAll rights to the Solution and Documentation, including all associated copyrights, patents, trade secret rights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, are reserved by Vendor.</p> 5.\nRestrictions <p>5.1.\nYou may not copy or use the Solution or the Documentation except as set forth in Section 2 of

PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.\nNO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WILL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n<p> 11.4.\nIf you and Vendor do not resolve any Dispute by informal negotiation, any other effort to resolve the Dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act (\u201c<i>FAA</i>\u201d), 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1 et seq., and the substantive laws of the State of New York (without regard to choice of laws principles).\nExcept as provided in Section 11.5 below, you are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in litigation as a party or class member) all Disputes in court before a judge or jury.\nInstead, all Disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right to judicial review under the FAA.\nAny court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator\u2019s award.</p>\n<p>\n11.5.\nThe arbitration requirement of this Section 11 is subject to the following exceptions:</p>\n<p>11.5.1.\nYou may litigate any Dispute in small claims court, in the county or other similar political subdivision in which you reside, if the Dispute meets all requirements to be heard in the small claims court.\nIf you initiate a claim in small claims court, you are responsible for all court costs and fees.</p>\n<p>11.5.2.\nAll Disputes concerning any alleged misappropriation of your or Vendor\u2019s intellectual property will be resolved in court.</p>\n<p>11.5.3.\nIf you are a consumer and live in the European Union, Norway, Iceland or Lichtenstein, you may be entitled to address your Dispute

resolutions relating to online purchases of goods and services between consumers and traders based in the European Union, Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein.\nYou will find the ODR Platform by following this link: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/.</p>\n<p>11.6.\nAny arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the \u201c<i>AAA</i>\u201d) in accordance with the AAA\u2019s \u201cConsumer Arbitration Rules\u201d effective September 1, 2014, including the \u201cCosts of Arbitration (Including AAA Administrative Fees)\u201d effective September 1, 2014

consumer (you) and others to the business (Vendor).\nIf your claim is US$75,000 or less, Vendor will pay all of those specified fees and costs, including those allocated to the consumer.\nVendor does not agree to bear any other costs.\nIf your claim is more than US$75,000, the Consumer Procedures will govern payment.</p>\n<p>11.6.2.\nExcept as provided in below, the AAA\u2019s Consumer Procedures will be applied to any Dispute between the parties.\nHowever, pursuant to Consumer Arbitration Rule R-1(e), a party may raise the proper application of the Consumer Arbitration Rules to an arbitrator for a final decision.\nThis Agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with the Consumer Procedures.\nYou will commence arbitration only in the county or other similar political subdivision in which you reside.\nThe arbitration proceedings will be conducted by conference call.\nHowever, if the proceedings are conducted pursuant to the AAA Consumer Procedures, the arbitrator(s) will have the discretionary authority to require a face-to-face hearing upon the request of a party.</p>\n<p>11.6.3.\nYou and the Vendor agree that the use of the AAA to administer arbitration is not integral to the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate Disputes.\nIf the AAA will not or cannot conduct an arbitration, you and Vendor will negotiate in good faith to agree on a sole arbitrator who will resolve the Dispute as provided in the Consumer Procedures.\nIf the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, a court of competent jurisdiction may appoint an arbitrator, who will follow the AAA\u2019s Consumer Procedures.</p>\n<p>11.6.4.\nIf one or more parts of this Section 11 are found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a Dispute, then, and only in that circumstance, those parts will be severed and the Dispute will be resolved subject to all remaining parts of this Section 11 and all other provisions of this Agreement.\nIf such severance results in all or some parts of a Dispute proceeding in a court of law, exclusive jurisdiction for any such court proceeding will be the courts sitting in the county of New York, New York, U.S.\nFor purposes of any such court proceeding, you consent to, and will not challenge, the New York, New York courts\u2019 personal jurisdiction over you, and you further waive objection based upon improper venue or forum non conveniens and will not seek transfer to another district or jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>11.7.\nNotwithstanding the preceding paragraphs of this Section 11, if you acquired a Solution for other than personal or household use, the arbitration proceedings, including the payment of costs, will be administered in accordance with the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules (the \u201c<i>Commercial Procedures</i>\u201d).\nThe Commercial Procedures are appropriately applied to any Dispute between the parties, and you will not advocate otherwise in any proceeding.\nHowever, this Agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with the Commercial Procedures.</p> 12.\nGeneral <p>\n12.1.\nNotice.\nVendor may at any time deliver any notice to you via electronic mail, pop-up window, dialog box or other means, even though in some cases you may not receive the notice unless and until you launch a Solution.\nAny such notice will be deemed delivered on the date Vendor first makes it available through a Solution, irrespective of when you actually receive it.</p>\n<p>12.2.\nQuestions About This Agreement.\nIf you have any questions regarding this Agreement or wish to request any information from Vendor, please.</p>\n<p>12.2.1.\nWrite to Avast Software s.r.o., Pikrtova 1737/1a, Prague 4, Postal Code 140 00, Czech Republic (tel.: +420 274 005 777).\nor</p>\n<p>12.2.2.\nContact Vendor by

jurisdiction that may not be waived by contract.\nThis Agreement, the Applicable Conditions and the Documentation, to the greatest extent reasonably practicable, will be construed to be consistent with each other, but in the event of a conflict they will govern in the following order of precedence: (i) the Applicable Conditions.\n(ii) this Agreement.\nand (iii) the
