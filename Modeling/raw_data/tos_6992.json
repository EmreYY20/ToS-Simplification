and Conditions <p>Effective April 26, 2021</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This document sets forth the terms and conditions (\u201cTerms\u201d) between Nexstar Media Inc.\n(\u201cNexstar\u201d) and Client with respect to the Client\u2019s purchase of advertising inventory on the Properties.\nThese Terms are an integral part of each Order as if fully set forth and incorporated therein.\nBy submitting an Order, you represent and warrant that you agree to enter into and perform the obligations set forth in these Terms and your willingness to be bound by the terms set forth herein and the Order.</p>\n<p>1.\nDefinitions.</p>\n<p>a.\nAdvertisement means any advertisement placed on a Property and all content included in the advertisement, including but not limited to photographs, audio,

placed on the Property(ies).<br>\nc.\nAgency/Buying Service means any Person who purchases the placement of any Advertisement on behalf of an Advertiser for placement on the Property(ies).<br>\nd.\nClient means the Advertiser and, if applicable, any Agency/Buying Service engaged by Advertiser, jointly and severally.<br>\ne.\nContract means any Order and these Terms.<br>\nf.\nOrder means each and every proposal, order, confirmation, invoice or other ordering document between Nexstar and Client.<br>\ng.\nPage means each individual, identifiable webpage

a governmental authority.<br>\ni.\nProgram means any program broadcast on a Station or MVPD channel.<br>\nj.\nProperty/Properties means any platform owned, serviced or used by Nexstar, including but not limited to any Program, the Internet, web sites, mobile applications, social media, distribution platforms, publications, any connected device or destination, and all other delivery platforms or methods of distribution, whether now known or hereafter devised, on which Client\u2019s advertising is placed, including (i) those Properties which are not owned by Nexstar but for which Nexstar has

the date on which any Advertisement is broadcast or published on a Property.<br>\nl.\nStation means any television station owned by Nexstar or one of its subsidiaries.</p>\n<p>2.\nContract.\nThe Order and these Terms represent the entire contract (\u201cContract\u201d) between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, negotiations, contracts and understandings between the parties, both oral and written.\nAny amendment to these Terms must be in writing and signed by Nexstar.\nThe terms of this Contract apply to the parties hereto and all of their successors or assigns.\nIf there is any conflict between the terms of the Order and these Terms, the terms of the Order will apply.\nIf any part of the Contract is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such term shall be excluded from the Contract and the remainder of the Contract will remain enforceable and in effect.</p>\n<p>3.\nOrder and Payment.\nNexstar reserves the right to increase or change the rates in any Order at any time for any Advertisement subject to demand and availability.\nIn the event Nexstar provides notice of any rate change, Client may terminate this Contract within ten (10) days of receipt of such notice.\nNexstar will bill Client monthly unless otherwise stated in the Order.\nThe Order invoice shall include the charges to Client for placement of the Advertisement on the Property(ies).\nClient must dispute any invoice in writing within 10 days of receipt, and any failure to do so within such 10-day period shall be deemed a waiver by Client of any claim relating to such disputed invoice.\nAdvertiser and Advertiser\u2019s Agency/Buying Service, jointly and severally, are obligated to pay Nexstar in full within 30 days after receipt without any deduction or right of set-off.\nPayment by Advertiser to Advertiser\u2019s Agency/Buying Service does not constitute payment to Nexstar, and failure of Advertiser\u2019s Agency/Buying Service to receive funds from Advertiser does not relieve such Agency/Buying Service of its obligations to timely make all payments due.\nFailure to pay in accordance with these terms may result in a monthly service charge of 1.5% (or the maximum amount permitted by law) on all unpaid balances not received within 30 days from receipt of invoice.\nNexstar may terminate any Order if

collection of all amounts due and owing by Client.</p>\n<p>4.\nPlacement.\nNexstar will provide Client with the use of commercial inventory on its specified Properties as mutually agreed in the Order to which these Terms are attached.\nNexstar will have sole determination of the placement of all Advertisements within a Program or Page.\nPlacements are not guaranteed.\nNexstar specifically disclaims (i) any obligation to place Client\u2019s Advertisement at a specific time or place, unless specifically agreed otherwise in writing in the Order, (ii) the scheduling of such Advertisement near competitive products and like advertisers, unless specifically agreed otherwise in writing in the Order and (iii) any overlays appearing on the Advertisement (e.g., EAS notifications, viewer tools, information and actions that a viewer or third party may activate, and the like).\nNexstar does not guarantee ratings for any Advertisement unless specifically set forth in the Order and shall have no obligation to provide Client with ratings information.\nClient agrees that placement of any Advertisement in any Program will result in such Advertisement being displayed via multichannel video programming distributors (\u201cMVPDs\u201d), virtual (OTT) MVPDs, video-on-demand, mobile applications and all other platforms on which the Program is broadcast.</p>\n<p>5.\nTelevision Inventory Preemptions.\nFrom time-to-time, preemptions of advertising may occur in any Program or on any Station for any reason.\nClient agrees that Nexstar may replace any preempted Advertisement with a \u201cMakegood\u201d in similar inventory.\nNexstar\u2019s rate cards (which are subject to change) and date of order entry will be the sole determinant of inventory clearance and preemption status (e.g., a grid 5 advertisement entered on May 5 will clear before a grid 5 advertisement entered on May 10.\na grid 4 advertisement regardless of date of entry will clear before all grid 5 advertisements, etc.) In the event Nexstar is unable to provide a Makegood, Nexstar may provide a credit not to exceed the amount paid by Client for such preempted Advertisement.\nSuch credit shall be Client\u2019s sole remedy for any preemption not made good.</p>\n<p>6.\nProgram Substitutions.\nNexstar makes no representations or guarantees regarding any Program.\nIn the event Client purchased a specific Program, Nexstar may substitute another Program for any Program purchased by Client if such original Program is no longer available.\nAny such replacement Program will be of comparable quality with comparable demographics (as determined by Nexstar in its sole discretion) and/or in the same time period and day as originally ordered.</p>\n<p>7.\nDigital Impressions.\nIn the event a digital Order guarantees delivery of a certain number of impressions, Nexstar will use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) deliver the impressions in accordance with the delivery obligations set forth in the Order and (ii) deliver the impressions starting with the start date and ending with the end date set forth in the Order.\nBecause the estimates are forecasts, Nexstar makes no guarantee regarding the levels of impressions for any individual Advertisement.\nUnless otherwise provided in the digital Order, (i) Nexstar will maintain impression delivery statistics and Advertiser acknowledges that impression delivery statistics provided by Nexstar are the official and definitive measurements of Nexstar\u2019s performance on any impression delivery obligations provided in an Order, and (ii) no other measurements or usage statistics (including those of Advertiser or any third party) shall be accepted by Nexstar or have any effect on an Order.\nIn the event the impression obligation set forth in an Order is reached prior to the end of the term of an Order, Nexstar may cease distribution of the Advertisement.\nThe impression obligation will be deemed reached if at least 90% of the impressions are delivered.\nIf there is a shortfall in delivery of impressions of more than 10% at the end of any specified period, Nexstar may provide, as Advertiser\u2019s sole remedy, \u201cMakegood\u201d impressions in the same or a comparable manner or class of time, or alternatively Nexstar may provide a credit.</p>\n<p>8.\nOrder Errors.\nUnless errors in the Order are brought to Nexstar\u2019s attention within three (3) business days of acceptance, the Contract is deemed accepted as written.\nNo verbal cancellation or changes to a Contract are permitted.\nBroadcast Orders may only be cancelled in writing no later than two weeks prior to each such Advertisement\u2019s Publication Date.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, a Client may request revisions to the Publication Dates and/or substitute new creative no later than two weeks prior to each such Advertisement\u2019s Publication Date.\nNo further changes will be accepted after such date.</p>\n<p>9.\nAdvertisement Standards.\nAll Advertisements furnished by Client must conform to Nexstar\u2019s standards as well as any advertising and technical guidelines provided by Nexstar to Advertiser.\nClient represents and warrants that all Advertisements furnished to Nexstar under this Contract (i) will comply with applicable federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and industry standards, (ii) will contain proper sponsorship identification under the Communications Act and FCC rules, (iii) will comply with applicable rules and policies of the Federal Trade Commission and any other government

with the party\u2019s collection, sharing, use and storage of data related to end users, their computing or mobile devices, and/or their interactions with the advertising materials.\nand (vii) comply with all applicable best industry standards in connection with the advertising materials, including but not limited to, those set forth by the Digital Advertising Alliance, Interactive Advertising

agents, programs, or programming routines.\nClient agrees to furnish advertising substantiation material to Nexstar promptly upon request.</p>\n<p>10.\nDelivery/Right of Rejection.\nClient is responsible for timely furnishing, at Client\u2019s sole cost and expense, all Advertisements to Nexstar by the deadline established.\nNexstar shall not be liable for its inability to deliver or place any Advertisement not timely received and Client will remain liable for payment of the reserved placement.\nNexstar has the right to reject any Advertisement in its sole discretion.\nNexstar will attempt to timely notify Client of such rejection.\nIn the event Nexstar provides a notice of rejection to Client of any Advertisement, Client is solely responsible for timely providing new creative to Nexstar.\nIf Client fails to timely furnish an appropriate new Advertisement, Nexstar, in its sole discretion, may schedule promotional or public service announcements in place of Client\u2019s rejected Advertisement with a courtesy identification to Advertiser.\nNo action by Nexstar under this paragraph will relieve Client of its obligations to make all payments provided for in the Order.\nLog time and Advertisement deadlines vary throughout the week and year.\nplease see your Account Executive for specific scheduling deadlines.</p>\n<p>11.\nIntellectual Property Rights.\nClient hereby represents and warrants that Advertiser owns, controls or has obtained all intellectual property rights (including all copyrights and music licensing rights and payments therefore) in and to
