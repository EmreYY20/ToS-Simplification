Tracking Technologies Table</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\nWhat Are \u2018Cookies\u2019?\n<p>Cookies are small files with pieces of information, normally consisting of just letters and numbers, which websites use when users visit them.</p>\n<p>Software on the users\u2019 devices (for example, a web browser) can store cookies and send them back to the website the next time they visit, to make a specific function of the website work and to provide information about the user\u2019s activities on the website.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nFor What Purposes Are Cookies Being Used?\n<p>Cookies are used in numerous ways.\nFor example, when analyzing traffic to a website or tracking users\u2019 browsing behavior.\nCookies are widely used as they allow a website to recognize a user\u2019s device.\nCookies and other similar technologies help websites to remember the visitors and their activities, for example, the user\u2019s login details, or the goods users wish to buy when they add goods to their online basket or proceed to the checkout on an internet shopping website.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nWhat Are \u2018Session\u2019 and \u2018Persistent\u2019 Cookies?\n<p>\u201cSession Cookies\u201d are removed from your device once you close your browser session.</p>\n<p>\u201cPersistent Cookies\u201d last for longer periods on your device \u2013 after you close your browser session.</p>\n<p>A user can delete previously set persistent cookies manually or configure the browser settings to delete cookies, as further described below.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nWhat Are \u2018First-party\u2019 and \u2018Third-party\u2019 Cookies?\n<p>First-party cookies are set directly by the website that the user is visiting.\nFor the purpose of this Policy, these are cookies that are set directly by this Website.</p>\n<p>Third-party cookies are set by a domain other than the one visited by the user.\nFor the purpose of this Policy, these are cookies that are set by service providers of this Website.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nWhat Are \u2018Similar Technologies\u2019?\n<p>Functions usually performed by a cookie can be achieved by other means.\nThis could include, for example, using certain characteristics to identify devices so that visits to a website can be analyzed.</p>\n<p>Any technology that stores or accesses information on the user\u2019s device is relevant for this purpose, and therefore it includes, for example, HTML5 local storage, Local Shared Objects and fingerprinting techniques.</p>\n<p>Additionally, technologies like scripts, tracking pixels and plugins, wherever these are used \u2013 are also considered as similar technologies.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nDoes Digital Turbine Use Tracking Technologies?\n<p>Yes, we do.</p>\n<p>We use both Session Cookies and Persistent

activities.\nThe same rule goes for all Tracking Technologies that we use.</p>\n<p>We have created a detailed Tracking Technologies table page, which is attached as an <strong>\n<u>Appendix A</u>\n</strong> to this Policy and is available <u>here.</u> The table will provide you with a clear and comprehensive image of the Tracking Technologies that we use.</p>\n<p>When a Tracking

providers by Digital Turbine, as designated in Appendix A, and the transfer of data to them for this purpose.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nDoes Digital Turbine Need to Obtain My Consent for Using Tracking Technologies?\n<p>Yes, however only with respect to the Tracking Technologies that are not strictly essential for the operation of this Website, as further indicated in <strong>\n<u>Appendix A</u>\n</strong>.\nFor essential Tracking Technologies Digital Turbine does not need your consent.</p>\n<p>If you do not agree to accept our cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are not strictly essential for the operation of this Website, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with as similar level of services as we can.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nCan I Manage My Tracking Technologies Preferences?\n<p>Every browser allows you to manage your Tracking Technologies preferences, usually found in the \u201cHelp\u201d or \u201cSettings\u201d sections of the web browser.</p>\n<p>Here are some links to some commonly used web browsers: (a) Google Chrome.\n(b) Microsoft Edge.\n(c) Mozilla Firefox.\n(d) Microsoft Internet Explorer.\n(e) Opera.\n(f) Apple
