parties involved from scamming claims and/or art theft.\n</p>\n<p> A character is defined as a creature with a particular backstory and a unique design illustrated by a reference image.\nA unique design is defined as a full-body image of a creature with a particular, complex set of markings not found in nature.\nFurry Paws will consider a copyright violation of a character to have occurred if:\n</p>\n<p>a.\nA character is used for a breeding without permission from the character owner</p>\n<p>b.\nA character duplicates the existing unique design of a previously existing character</p>\n<p>c.\nA particular backstory is plagiarized</p>\n<p> Artistic Materials may only be sold for real life currencies on the \u201cUSD Art Sales Board\u201d.\nAll other Artistic Materials must be sold on the \u201cArt Sales Board\u201d for in-game currencies only.\nIn order to sell on the \u201cUSD Art Sales Board\u201d, a player must obtain a \u201cPlayer Recommended Artist\u201d (PRA) status.\nThis may be obtained by submitting an application through the ModBox.\nTo be eligible for this status a player must be at least level 10, have no previous warnings for art issues, and have a positive player rating in the game.\nAdditionally, activity on the \u201cArt Sales Board\u201d, non-art related player warnings, and contributions to the site Image Bank may also be considered.\n</p>\n<p> The PRA is NOT A SITE RECOMMENDATION as to who you should buy from.\nThe PRA status will be given at the sole discretion of the admin of the site.\nPRA status is a privilege, not a right, and may be revoked at any time for any reason.\nIf a user's PRA is revoked, they cannot re-apply to obtain a PRA for at least 6 months.\nIf an account with a PRA status is sold to\nanother user, the PRA status and any ratings will be revoked.\nIt is the responsibility of the user who earned the PRA to submit a modbox report regarding the sale of the account prior to completing the sale of the account.\nFailure to do so may result in a warning.\n</p>\n<p> Any and all sales of Artistic Materials on FP that is done for USD, or any other real life currencies, are not the responsibility of FP.\nHowever, FP has a zero tolerance policy for scamming, and should we find what we consider to be conclusive evidence of scamming having occurred, we will IP ban and freeze the offending player(s).\nShould you decide to purchase art on FP with USD, we recommend that you do the following:</p>\n<p>a.\nPrior to sending payment, message the artist on FP with details of the commission.\nWe strongly advise that you follow the\npractices outlined in the in-game currency sales section above.</p>\n<p>b.\nUpon sending payment through the payment site, include a copy of the FP message with your payment</p>\n<p>c.\nIf work/art piece fails to be completed you must go though the payment site used to get a refund.\nHowever if Messages showing that both parties agree the work/art piece would be delivered by a certain date, proof of payment is provided, and the artist cannot show that the art was delivered, repercussions for scamming will be investigated by the Mod team.\nIf no evidence is provided which indicates that a clear timeline was agreed upon, the commissioner must just wait, with a maximum wait time of 30 days from commission date at that time.\nAfter that point, if the commissioner can show Suitable Evidence that the agreement between the commissioner and artist was violated, repercussions can be taken but a refund will not be the responsibility of FP.</p>\n<p>Any transaction that is not directly covered by the above outline will be at the discretion of the Mod Team to allow and will be at the seller's/buyer's own risk if they proceed.</p>
