place, the lower is the potential for misuse and theft.\n</p>\n<p> We only store data that\u2019s absolutely necessary for the operation of the service, and we store it for the shortest amount of time possible.\nAll messages are always transmitted in end-to-end encrypted form and are only stored on the server until successful delivery.\nOnce a message has been delivered to the recipient, it is immediately and irreversibly deleted on the server.\nIt\u2019s not required to provide personal information in order to use Threema.\nWe don\u2019t store IP addresses, and we don\u2019t keep message logs.\nFor further details, please refer to our privacy policy.\n</p>\n<p> With Threema, the user applies the encryption, not the service provider.\nThe decryption of a message is only possible with the recipient\u2019s private key.\nThis private key was generated by the recipient, and we don\u2019t have access to it.\nIt is therefore technically impossible for us to decrypt users\u2019 messages.\n</p>\n<p> Threema GmbH is not required to store communication metadata (\u201cdata retention\u201d), as it does not exceed the revenue limits set by the Federal Act on the Surveillance of Post and Telecommunications (B\u00dcPF) (version in effect since 01.03.2018) and the accompanying decree V\u00dcPF.\n</p>\n<p> However, Threema GmbH must provide information that it already has upon judicial order.\nTherefore, we make a point of processing and storing as little information about our users as possible.\n</p>\n<p> Here is how we handle requests for information about our users from authorities: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>According to article 26 paragraph 2 of the V\u00dcPF, we only deal with inquiries placed through the PTSS according to the procedure mandated by the V\u00dcPF, and that fully meet the formal requirements according to legal examination.\n</li>\n<li>Foreign authorities have to make an official request for legal assistance in accordance with the Federal Act on International Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters.\nwe don\u2019t deal with direct inquiries by foreign authorities.\n</li>\n<li>If the legal requirements are fully met, we can provide the following information associated with a given Threema ID: <ul>\n<li>Hash of phone number, if provided by the user</li>\n<li>Hash of email address, if provided by the user</li>\n<li>Push token, if a push service is used</li>\n<li>Public key</li>\n<li>Date (without time) of Threema ID creation</li>\n<li>Date (without time) of last login</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Here\u2019s a statistic of all requests by authorities that we have received since 2014: </p> Year Requests by Swiss authorities Requests by foreign authorities with Swiss legal assistance Requests that have met the formal requirements
