amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (collectively, the \u201cCPRA\u201d) and applies solely to the personal information and Fidelity companies that are subject to the CPRA.\nAs used in this section, \u201cpersonal information\u201d means information that meets the definition of \u201cpersonal information\u201d as set forth in the CPRA and is not otherwise excluded from the scope of the CPRA.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Fidelity companies and the CPRA</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Depending on the Fidelity company with which you have a relationship or otherwise interact, the nature of your relationship and interactions with that Fidelity company, and the products and services provided to you through that relationship, some or all of the personal information that the Fidelity company collects or maintains is covered by one or more of the exemptions described below (see the section below entitled \u201cCPRA Exemptions\u201d).\nAs a result, in some cases, the applicable Fidelity company may have no obligation under the CPRA to accept any CPRA requests, and in other cases, it may have no obligation to honor a particular CPRA request, because of the nature of the personal information that the Fidelity company collects or maintains.\nHere are some examples of CPRA exemptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If your relationship and interactions with a Fidelity company consist solely of personal financial services (e.g., maintaining one or more personal brokerage accounts), the personal information collected and processed about you is subject to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (\u201cGLBA\u201d) and therefore your CPRA request will not be honored by the Fidelity company.</li>\n<li>If you participate in a workplace retirement plan, or other employee benefit plan sponsored by or provided through your employer, that is serviced or administered by a Fidelity company, <strong>CPRA requests should be directed to your employer</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Your Rights Under the CPRA</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The CPRA gives certain rights to California residents and imposes certain obligations on those businesses that are subject to the CPRA.\nAs required by the CPRA, set forth below is a description of certain rights that California residents generally have under the CPRA.\nAs used below, a \u201cconsumer\u201d means a resident of the State of California and a \u201ccovered business\u201d means a business that is subject to the CPRA.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Right to Know/Right to Access.\nA consumer has the right to request that a covered business that collects a consumer\u2019s personal information disclose to that consumer the categories and specific pieces of information the business has collected.\nA consumer also has the right to request that a covered business that collects a consumer\u2019s personal information disclose to that consumer the following:\n<ol>\n<li>The categories of personal information it has collected about that consumer</li>\n<li>The categories of sources from which the personal information is collected</li>\n<li>The business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling or sharing (if applicable) personal information</li>\n<li>The categories of third parties to whom the covered business discloses personal information</li>\n<li>The specific pieces of personal information that the covered business has collected about that consumer</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>These disclosures are not required to include any information about activity that occurred prior to January 1, 2022.\nPlease also note that a covered business is not required to honor more than 2 of these requests from the same consumer during any 12-month period.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Right to Delete.\nA consumer has the right to request that a covered business delete any personal information that the business has collected from the consumer, subject to certain exceptions.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Right to Correct.\nA consumer has the right to request that a covered business correct inaccuratepersonal information that a business maintains about a consumer.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Right to Opt-Out of Sale/Sharing.\nIf a covered business sells or shares personal information, a consumer has the right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of their personal information by the business.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information.\nIf a covered business uses or discloses sensitive personal information for reasons other than those set forth in the CPRA, a consumer has the right to limit the use or disclosure of sensitive personal information by the business.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Non-Discrimination.\nA consumer has the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by the covered business for the exercise of privacy rights conferred by the CPRA.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Categories of personal information we may collect about you</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In general, if

based on the following criteria: (1) the length of time that the data is needed for the purposes for which it was created or collected, (2) the length of time the data is needed for other operational

information we may collect about you\u201d section above, with the categories of third parties listed in the section above entitled \u201c<strong>How we share information about you with third parties\u201d</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Other information about our handling of personal information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Please note that we do not \u201csell\u201d or \u201cshare\u201d (as defined in the CPRA) personal information about you to any third party and have not done so at any time during the 12-month period preceding the date this privacy policy was last updated.\nIn addition, we do not sell or share personal information of minors under 16 years of age.</p>\n<p>Because we do not sell or share personal information, Fidelity companies do not have any obligation under the CPRA to accept CPRA requests requesting that the Fidelity companies not sell or share a consumer\u2019s personal information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>CPRA Exemptions</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Please note that certain types of personal information collected or maintained by a covered business are exempt from the CPRA.\nFor example, a covered business has limited obligations, or in some cases, no obligations, under the CPRA with regard to the following types of personal information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personal information collected, processed, sold, or disclosed pursuant to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (Public Law 106-102) and implementing regulations, or pursuant to the California Financial Information Privacy Act (Division 1.4 [commencing with Section 4050] of the California Financial Code)</li>\n<li>Medical information governed by the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act or protected health information that is collected by a covered entity or business associate pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, some businesses are not subject to the CPRA, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A business that does not do business in the State of California</li>\n<li>A business that is not organized or operated for the profit of financial benefit of its shareholders or other owners</li>\n<li>A business that does not determine the purposes and means of the processing of consumers\u2019 personal information</li>\n<li>A business that has annual gross revenue of $25,000,000 or less</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Furthermore, under the CPRA, there are a number of situations where a covered business under the CPRA may refuse to honor a CPRA request to delete a consumer\u2019s personal information and is allowed to continue to maintain the personal information.\nSome examples include situations where retention of the personal information is reasonably necessary to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete the transaction for which the personal information was collected, provide a good or service requested by the consumer or reasonably anticipated within the context of the covered business\u2019s ongoing business relationship with the consumer, or otherwise perform a contract between the Fidelity company and the consumer</li>\n<li>Help to ensure security and integrity to the extent the use of the personal information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for those purposes</li>\n<li>Debugging to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality</li>\n<li>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise that consumer\u2019s right of free speech, or exercise another right provided by law</li>\n<li>To enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on the consumer's relationship with the business and compatible with the context in which the consumer provided the information</li>\n<li>Comply with a legal obligation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note that the description of the CPRA set forth in this privacy policy is a summary of only certain aspects of the CPRA and is not and should not be considered a complete description of the CPRA.\nIn addition to what is described above, the CPRA includes other exemptions that apply to particular types of personal information and particular businesses, as well as additional situations where a covered business is not required to honor a consumer\u2019s request to delete the consumer\u2019s personal information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Submitting a CPRA Request</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>If you wish to submit a CPRA request to any of the Fidelity companies listed in this privacy policy, you may initiate your request through one of the options provided on our</strong> California Privacy Rights Request Page.\nBefore submitting your request, please ensure you have reviewed all the CPRA exemptions, including those described above under the section above entitled \u201c<strong>CPRA Exemptions</strong>\u201d.</p>\n<p>You should generally expect to receive a response within 45 days of the date we receive your request.\nHowever, in some instances, we may require an additional 45 days to process your request in which case we will notify you and explain why the extension is necessary.</p>\n<p>We will need to verify your identity before we can process your request.\nThrough the request process, we will make you aware of any information that you will need to provide to us to process your request.\nYou may have to confirm that you are a California resident and verify your identity or the identities of those authorized to submit requests on your behalf.\nAdditionally, the information you provide will be used to help verify your identity.</p>\n<p>To understand how you can designate an authorized agent with the ability to make a request under the CPRA on your behalf, please refer to our California Privacy Rights Request page.</p>\n<p>Fidelity companies covered by this privacy policy received 12 CCPA requests for disclosure of personal information (request to know) and 18 CCPA requests for deletion of personal information (request to delete) between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021.\nFidelity companies responded to each of these requests in an average of 10.46 days.\nHowever, because of exemptions under the CPRA, Fidelity companies did not comply with any of these requests.</p>\n&nbsp.\n<p>\n<strong>Fidelity Companies Covered by this Privacy Policy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Fidelity Investments
