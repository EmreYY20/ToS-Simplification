<small>(Effective Date: January 19, 2016)</small> General <p> Mudfish Networks and its affiliates (hereinafter, \"we\", \"us\" or \"our\") are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.\n</p>\n<p> This Privacy Policy (together with our Terms and Conditions of Use) governs our collection, processing and use of your Personal Information.\nWe define \"Personal Information\" as information which identifies you personally, e.g.\nyour name, address and e-mail address etc.\n</p>\n<p> The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you of: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>the kinds of Personal Information which we may collect about you and how it may be used.\n</li>\n<li>our use of information regarding IP Addresses and our use of cookies.\n</li>\n<li>any disclosure of Personal Information to third parties.\n</li>\n<li>your ability to correct, update and delete your Personal Information.\nand </li>\n<li>the security measures we have in place to prevent the loss, misuse, or alteration of Personal Information under our control.\n</li>\n</ol> Anonymity <p> While we always anonymize your true IP address while using the Services, remember that no VPN provider can control what other apps collect from your device or what cookies other websites or third parties place in your browser.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Our product will never store, log, or share your true IP address, and we always delete your true IP address after your VPN session is closed.\n</li>\n<li> We never associate your email, true IP address, username, or unique mobile ID with your browsing information or online activities when you are using Mudfish.\n</li>\n<li> We never share your personal information with unaffiliated third parties other than service providers that we use for internal technology and business operations (such as website hosting, payment processing, data analysis, information technology, customer service, and email delivery).\n</li>\n<li> We only use your information to provide you with amazing products and services that we are constantly working to improve.\n</li>\n</ul> Automatically Collected Information <p> When you use our Services, we collect information about you or your device automatically.\nHere's a fuller explanation of the types of information we collect when you use our Services: </p>\n<li> When you visit our websites: <ul>\n<li> We and our third party service providers may automatically collect information from your device, sometimes by placing cookies, beacons, and similar technologies in your browser and on emails that we send you.\nWe may use this information, for example, to ensure that the Services function properly, to determine how many users have visited certain pages or opened messages or newsletters, or to prevent fraud.\nIf you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site.\nYou may also wish to refer to http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html.\nKeep in mind though, if you do not accept cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services.\n</li>\n<li> Your IP address may be collected when you visit our websites.\nCollecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites and other online services.\nWe use IP addresses for internal purposes such as calculating usage levels and diagnosing server problems.\nWe

operating system version, browser type, language, wireless network, and mobile network information.\nThis information does not identify you, and we use it to provide and improve the Services,

or proxy IP address.\nWe may also use your IP address to derive your approximate location in order to effectively provide the Services.\nAgain, your true IP address is stored only for the duration of your VPN session and is cleared after your session is closed.\nWe do not associate your true IP address with your online activities and we do not store or log your true IP address after the end of your session.\n</li>\n<li> When you launch Mudfish, we also collect device-specific information, such as the hardware model, operating system version, browser type, language, wireless network, and mobile network information.\nThis information does not identify you, and we use it to provide and improve the Services, troubleshoot, and perform analytics on our services.\n</li>\n<li> When you use Mudfish to access the internet, we collect only anonymous, aggregate data about which websites you visit and which apps you use.\nWe do not attribute any specific website visits or app usage to any specific user.\nWe collect this information to: <ol>\n<li> Perform analytics on our services, including measuring whether our users are able to successfully access certain websites or apps.\n</li>\n<li> Troubleshoot service issues and improve service quality.\n</li>\n<li> Place generic ads in front of specific apps or websites.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li> International

assist us in better understanding our visitors' interests in our Site and how to better serve those interests.\nThe information collected by our service provider(s) may be linked to and combined with information that we collect about you while you are using the Mudfish service.\nOur service provider(s) is/are contractually restricted from using information they receive from our Site other than to
