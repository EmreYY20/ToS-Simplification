other products and services, either directly, such as via email or mail, or via other channels, including social media platforms and websites.\nSometimes, you might tick a box to let us know you would like to receive marketing, and sometimes we might gather from your interactions and relationship with us, that you would like to hear about our other products and services.\nYou can always opt out of marketing by following the instructions on the message, email or letter you receive or by reaching out to our customer services team on the contact details below</li>\n<li>to develop and improve our

that does not identify you to anyone receiving the insight and trend information</li>\n<li>where permitted, authorised or required by an applicable law, such as to Australian Government agencies,

to protect your information as carefully as we do.\nSometimes, this may also include our own subsidiaries.</p>\n<p>Where you undertake a transaction processed by us on behalf of an agency or merchant, we may also share some information back with that third party to complete the transaction or keep them informed.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Overseas use and disclosure:</b>\n</p>\n<p>When you send letters or parcels overseas, we may send personal information to countries outside Australia to facilitate the delivery.\nThis information may be handled in line with the laws and customs of those

the laws of another country.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, we use systems or service providers located in other countries.\nWhen we do this, we will ensure your personal information is managed in a way that is consistent with Australian privacy law and this Privacy Statement, even if we need to undertake to comply with the applicable laws of those other countries.</p>\n<p>We use service providers in other

how we handle information, including your personal information.\nThese include:</p>\n<p>The Archives Act \u2013 As a Government Business Enterprise, Australia Post has obligations under the Archives Act 1983, which requires us to keep information for varying lengths of time.</p>\n<p>Australian Postal Corporations Act \u2013 The Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 includes limitations on how we use information as well as some permitted situations where we may disclose articles and their contents, such as where reasonably necessary for law enforcement activities.</p> Children\u2019s privacy <p>Australia Post believes it is important to provide added protection for children.\nWe encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children to participate in and monitor their online activity.</p>\n<p>When we provide a product or service that intentionally collects personal information from children, such as a police check, we will use reasonable efforts to confirm parent or guardian consent prior to the collection and use of personal information.\nThe way we do this may vary depending on the information, product, service, or event that the child wishes to participate in.\nConsent may take a variety of forms such as printing and submitting a permission form by mail, or online consent such as by ticking an online check box that parental or guardian consent has been obtained.</p>\n<p>Parents or guardians may, subject to any applicable laws, request that information collected from their child be deleted.<br>\n&nbsp;</p> Access to personal information <p>You have a right to request access to your personal information, and we want to make it easy for you to do so.\nThe information you would like access to may be on your MyPost account, or easily accessible by

laws, we will respond to your request within a reasonable time \u2013 usually within 30 days.\nWe ask that you identify, as clearly as possible, the type/s of information requested.\nIn some cases, we may need to verify your identity before we share information with you.</p>\n<p>We may not be able to provide access to all your personal information.\nIn some situations, the law permits us to refuse your request to provide you with access to your personal information.\nFor example, where giving access to your information would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of other individuals, or would pose a serious threat to the life, health, or safety of any individual or to public health or public safety.<br>\n&nbsp;</p> Correction of personal information <p>Ensuring your personal information is accurate and up to date is crucial for the delivery of many of our services, and you have a right to request the correction of your personal information.\nWe try to make this easy for

customer services team on the contact details listed below.</p> Complaints and how complaints are handled <p>We understand that from time to time, you may have queries or concerns about how we handle
