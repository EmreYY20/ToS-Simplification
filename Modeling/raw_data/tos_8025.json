natural person.\nAn identifiable natural person can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an

operation or set of operations performed on data such as the collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction of said data.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>3.\nCollecting and processing personal data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The scope of how we collect and process your personal and non-personal data or other information depends on the way you interact with us or our technologies and services:</p>\n<p>\u00b7 &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nAs a visitor of www.admitad.com</p>\n<p>\u00b7 &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nAs a publisher or an advertiser of the Admitad affiliate network</p>\n<p>\u00b7 &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nAs a user of our publishers\u2019 and/or advertisers\u2019 websites</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;As a job applicant to Admitad.</p>\n<p>With this Privacy Policy, we want to inform you of which information we receive and use at every stage.<br>We use personal data only to administer and provide our technologies and services.\nWe store personal and any other kind of data strictly in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy legislation and our contractual duties and will prevent unauthorized access to data to the best of our abilities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>4.\nNewsletters</strong>\n</p>\n<p>With the following information, we will inform you of the contents of our newsletter and the procedure for the registration and dissemination of newsletters, and the evaluation of statistics thereof, as well as your right to object to the procedure.\nBy subscribing to our newsletter, you agree to the receipt of the newsletter and the procedures described.</p>\n<p>We send out newsletters, emails, and other electronic notifications with promotional information (hereinafter \u201cNewsletter\u201d) subject to the recipient\u2019s consent or legal permission.</p>\n<p>Registering for our newsletter is handled through a so-called double opt-in procedure, which means you will receive an email after you register, in which you will be asked to confirm your registration once again.\nRegistrations for the newsletter are recorded to prove adherence to the precise registration process according to legal requirements.\nThis includes storing the time of logon and confirmation.\nFurthermore, changes to the data stored by Mindbox, a third-party service, are also recorded.</p>\n<p>The newsletters can be sent by Admitad or Mindbox.</p>\n<p>Mindbox is a newsletter platform of the Dutch company Mindbox.Cloud B.V.\n(a Dutch private limited company) located at Strawinskylaan 613, 1077XX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.</p>\n<p>The email addresses of our newsletter recipients and further data described in the context of this information are stored on Admitad\u2019s and Mindbox\u2019s respective servers.\nMindbox uses this information to send out and evaluate the newsletters on our behalf.\nIn addition, Mindbox can use this data to optimize or improve its services, e.g., for the technical optimization of the dissemination and the presentation of the newsletter or for economic purposes to determine from which countries the recipients come.\nHowever, Mindbox does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to contact them independently or transfer data to third parties except in cases prescribed by Mindbox\u2019s Privacy Policy (https://mindbox.cloud/documents/privacy-policy/).</p>\n<p>To register for the newsletter, we only need your email address.\nAny other voluntarily provided information about you is only used to personalize the newsletter.\nYou can change the personal data you share with us at any time.</p>\n<p>There are cases when we direct newsletter recipients to Mindbox\u2019s websites.\nFor instance, our newsletters contain a link with which newsletter recipients can access newsletters online (for example, in case of problems displaying the newsletter in the email program).</p>\n<p>You may terminate the receipt of our newsletter at any time, which means you revoke your consent to receive it.\nBy doing so, your consent to the dissemination of the newsletter via Mindbox and statistical analysis thereof expires at the same time.\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to cancel the dissemination of the newsletter via Mindbox or the statistical evaluation thereof through other means.\nYou may withdraw your consent to receive our newsletter at any time by changing the notification settings in your account.\nIn addition, you can find a link to unsubscribe from our newsletter at the bottom of each newsletter.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.\nLegal Basis</strong>\n<br>The processing of your personal data relies on the following legal bases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your consent, if you have given us such consent (Art.\n6 (1) (a) of GDPR)</li>\n<li>The initiation or execution of a contract with you (Art.\n6 (1) (b) of GDPR)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The fulfillment of legal obligations (Art.\n6 (1) (c) of GDPR)</li>\n<li>The implementation of our legitimate interests (Art.\n6 (1) (f) of GDPR).&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nData protection and transmission to third parties</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Admitad takes all technical and organizational security measures required to protect your personal data from loss, unauthorized disclosure, or other forms of misuse.\nData is stored in a safe environment that is not open to public access.\nYour personal data may be encrypted before transmission in certain cases (e.g., processing your login data).\nThis means that communication between your device and our servers will include recognized encryption measures if your browser supports doing so.</p>\n<p>Our staff has been trained in privacy matters and responsibly handling personal data and information to which they gain access.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that should you contact us via email, the confidentiality of the information therein may not be ensured.\nThird persons may have access to the contents of emails.</p>\n<p>For Admitad to execute its business processes in a convenient and optimal manner, it may be necessary for certain data to be processed by trusted third parties and reliable partners.\nThese third parties may:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Process payments</li>\n<li>Fulfill orders</li>\n<li>Send emails</li>\n<li>Manage communications (e.g., newsletters, security notifications, chat, etc.)</li>\n<li>Host websites</li>\n<li>Conduct other related activities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>on behalf of Admitad.\nHowever, Admitad only shares data that is needed to serve the specific purpose for which the third parties are engaged.\nAdmitad ensures that these third parties are under similar obligations to maintain privacy and confidentiality as Admitad\u2019s own employees and that they will handle your information in the way and to the extent Admitad is permitted to.\nAdmitad does not allow any third party to use your information for any purposes for which the information was not collected.</p>\n<p>Admitad will only disclose your personally identifiable information (PII) outside the country you live in if it is necessary for the intended purpose of processing.\nHowever, as a member of the worldwide Admitad group of companies, each local Admitad entity may maintain or perform data processing operations in countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) or in countries without an adequate level of data protection if doing so is required for the fulfillment of our obligations or the underlying contract with you.\nFurthermore, subcontractors of Admitad, which Admitad engages to act on its behalf concerning the processing of your PII, may be domiciled in such areas.</p>\n<p>To secure the transfer and processing of PII under chapter 5 of GDPR, Admitad has implemented and requested the required technical and organizational measures and has entered into the appropriate contractual frameworks with Admitad Group companies and subcontractors, which ensure that the data recipient has implemented an adequate level of data privacy in its organization as required by GDPR.\nThis includes the signing of Data Processing Agreements and European Union standard contractual clauses issued by the EU Commission.\nThese precautions are appropriate safeguards as stipulated by Article 46 GDPR and local data protection laws in effect, ensuring that your information will be treated securely, confidentially, and under the applicable data protection laws.</p>\n<p>If Admitad is acquired by or merges with a third party, we reserve the right, in either of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from you as part of such a merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.\nIn the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors\u2019 rights generally, we may not be able to control how your information is treated, transferred, or used.</p>\n<strong>7.\nTransfer to Third Countries</strong>\n<p>Data is transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area.\nWe only transfer personal data to third countries where the EU Commission has confirmed an adequate level of protection or where we can ensure the careful handling of personal data by employing contractual agreements or other suitable guarantees, such as certifications or proven compliance with international security standards.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Our affiliated companies may be&nbsp;located outside the EU (https://www.admitad.com/en/site/about/contacts/)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.\nUser

observing applicable privacy legislation, we will erase your data without any action required by you if retention of your data is no longer necessary for the purpose pursued or retention is no longer allowed for any legal reason.\nWe may restrict processing instead of erasing your data where it is legally not allowed to erase (e.g., legal obligations to maintain your personal data).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.\nAmendments</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may modify this Privacy Policy and our data security provisions at any time, particularly if new laws and/or regulations need to be adopted or if we regard amendments as reasonable.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.\nQuestions/Contacts</strong>\n</p>\n<p>For all questions and requests related to the security of your personal data, please
