certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active).<br>\n<br> We use Google's online AdWords marketing tool \"AdWords\" to place ads on the Google advertising network (eg in search results, in videos, on websites, etc.) so that they are displayed to users who have a suspected interest in the ads.\nThis allows us to more specifically display ads for and within our online offering so that we only present ads to users that potentially match their interests.\nFor example, if a user sees ads for products he's been looking for on other online offerings, that's called remarketing.\nFor these purposes, upon access to our and other websites where the Google Advertising Network is active, Google will immediately execute a Google code and become so-called (re) marketing tags (invisible graphics or code, also known as \"web beacons\") incorporated into the website.\nWith their help, the user can store an individual cookie, ie a small file (instead of cookies, comparable technologies can also be used).\nIn this file is noted which websites the user visited, for what content he is interested and what offers the user has clicked, as well as technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visit time and other information on the use of the online offer.<br>\n<br> Furthermore, we receive an individual \"conversion cookie\".\nThe information obtained through the cookie is used by Google to generate conversion statistics for us.\nHowever, we only hear the anonymous total number of users who clicked on our ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page.\nHowever, we do not receive any information that personally identifies users.<br>\n<br> The data of the users are pseudonym processed within the Google advertising network.\nFor example, Google does not store and process users' names or e-mail addresses, but processes the relevant data in a cookie-related manner within pseudonymous user profiles.\nThat is, from the perspective of Google, the ads are not managed and displayed to a specifically identified person, but to the cookie owner, regardless of who that cookie owner is.\nThis does not apply if a user has explicitly allowed Google to process the data without this pseudonymization.\nThe information collected about users is transmitted to Google and stored on Google's servers in the United States.<br>\n<br> For more information about Google's data usage, hiring and disparaging options, please read Google's Privacy Policy (https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads) and Google's Ads Ads Settings (https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated).\n</p>\nBing Ads\n<p> Based on our legitimate interests (ie interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art.\n6 (1) lit.\nDSGVO), we base our online offer on the conversion and tracking tool \"Bing Ads\" Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA.\nMicrosoft stores cookies on the users' devices in order to allow users to analyze the use of our online offer as long as users have accessed our online offer via a Microsoft Bing ad (so-called \"conversion measurement\").\nMicrosoft and we can thus recognize that someone clicked on an ad, was redirected to our online offer, and reached a previously determined landing page (called the \"conversion page\").\nWe only hear the total number of users who clicked on a Bing ad and were then redirected to the conversion page.\nNo IP addresses are stored.\nNo personal information on the identity of the users is given.<br>\n<br> Microsoft is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000KzNaAAK&amp;status=Active).<br>\n<br> If users do not want to participate in the Bing Ads tracking process, you may opt out of setting a cookie

to communicate with customers, prospects and users active there and to inform them about our services.<br>\n<br> We point out that data of the users outside the area of the European Union can be processed.\nThis may result in risks for the users because e.g.\nenforcement of user rights could be made more difficult.\nWith respect to US providers certified under the Privacy Shield, we point out that they are committed to respecting EU privacy standards.<br>\n<br> Furthermore, the data of the users are usually processed for market research and advertising purposes.\nThus, e.g.\nuser profiles are created from the user behavior and the resulting interests of the users.\nThe usage profiles can in turn be used to e.g.\nPlace advertisements inside and outside the platforms that are allegedly in line with users' interests.\nFor these purposes, cookies are usually stored on the computers of the users, in which the user behavior and the interests of the users are stored.\nFurthermore, in the usage profiles, data can also be stored independently of the devices used by the users (in particular if the users are members of the respective platforms and logged in to them).<br>\n<br> The processing of the personal data of users is based on our legitimate interests in an effective information of users and communication with users in accordance with.\nArt.\n6 para.\n1 lit.\nf.\nDSGVO.\nIf the users are asked by the respective providers for a consent to the data processing (that is, they declare their agreement, for example, by ticking a check box or confirming a button), the legal basis of the processing is Art.\n6 para.\na., Art.\n7 GDPR.<br>\n<br> For a detailed description of the respective processing and the possibilities of contradiction (opt-out), we refer to the following linked information of the provider.<br>\n<br> Also in the case of requests for information and the assertion of user rights, we point out that these can be claimed most effectively from the providers.\nOnly the providers have access to the data of the users and can directly take appropriate measures and provide information.\nIf you still need help, then you can

contents of a newsletter are concretely described, they are authoritative for the consent of the users.\nIncidentally, our newsletter contains information about our services and us.\nDouble opt-in and logging: Registration for our newsletter is done in a so-called double-opt-in procedure.\nThis means you will receive an e-mail after logging in to ask for confirmation of your registration.\nThis confirmation is necessary so that nobody can register with external e-mail addresses.\nThe registration for the newsletter will be logged in order to prove the registration process according to the legal requirements.\nThis includes the storage of the login and the confirmation time, as well as the IP address.\nLikewise, changes to your data stored with the shipping service provider will be logged.\nCredentials: To subscribe to the newsletter, it is sufficient to provide your e-mail address.\nOptionally, we ask you to give a name in the newsletter for personal address.\nThe dispatch of the newsletter and the associated performance measurement are based on a consent of the recipients acc.\nArt.\n6 para.\n1 lit.\na, Art.\n7 DSGVO in connection with \u00a7 7 Abs.\n2 Nr.\n3 UWG or if

Ponce De Leon Ave # 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA.\nThe privacy policy of the email service provider can be viewed here: https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/.\nThe Rocket Science Group LLC is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European data protection standards

processing agreement acc.\nArt.\n28 (3) sentence 1 DSGVO.\nThe service provider may use the data of the recipient in a pseudonymous form, ie without assignment to a user, to optimize or improve their own services, eg for the technical optimization of shipping and the presentation of newsletters or for statistical purposes.\nHowever, the service provider does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to address them themselves or to pass the data on to third parties.\n<b> NEWSLETTER - SUCCESS MEASUREMENT\n</b>\nThe newsletters contain a so-called \"web beacon\", ie a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from the server when the newsletter is opened by our server or, if we use a shipping service provider.\nThis call will initially collect technical information, such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and time of retrieval.\nThis information is used to improve the technical performance of services based on their specifications or audience and their reading habits, based on their locations (which can be determined using the IP address) or access times.\nStatistical surveys also include determining if the newsletters will be opened, when they will be opened and which links will be clicked.\nFor technical reasons, this information can be assigned to the individual newsletter recipients.\nHowever, it is neither our goal nor, if used, that of the shipping service provider to observe individual users.\nThe evaluations serve us much more to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users.\nA separate revocation of the success measurement is unfortunately not possible, in this case, the entire newsletter subscription must be terminated.\n<b> HOSTING AND E-MAIL\n</b>\nThe hosting services we use are designed to provide the following services: infrastructure and platform services, computing capacity, storage and database

solution that allows us to manage so-called website tags through a single interface (including integrating Google Analytics and other Google marketing services into our online offering).\nThe tag manager itself (which implements the tags) does not process users' personal data.\nWith regard to the processing of users' personal data, reference is made to the following information about Google's services.\nUsage Policy: https://www.google.com/analytics/tag-manager/use-policy/.\n<b> GOOGLE ANALYTICS\n</b>\nBased on our legitimate interests (ie interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art.\n6 (1) lit.\nDSGVO), we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC (\"Google\").\nGoogle uses cookies.\nThe information generated by the cookie about the use of the online offer by the users are usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.\nGoogle is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active).\nGoogle will use this information on our behalf to evaluate the use of our online offer by users, to compile reports on the activities within this online offer and to provide us with further services related to the use of this online offer and the internet usage.\nIn this case, pseudonymous usage profiles of the users can be created from the processed data.\nWe only use Google Analytics with activated IP anonymization.\nThis means that the IP address of the users will be shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area.\nOnly in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there.\nThe IP address submitted by the user's browser will not be merged with other data provided by Google.\nUsers can prevent the storage of cookies by setting their browser software accordingly.\nUsers may also prevent the collection by Google of the data generated by the cookie and related to its use of the online offer and the processing of such data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the following link: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.\nAs an

hiring and disparaging options, please read Google's Privacy Policy (https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads) and Google's Ads Ads Settings (https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated).\nThe personal data of users will be deleted or anonymized after 14 months.\n<b> GOOGLE ADWORDS AND CONVERSION MEASUREMENT\n</b>\nWe use the services of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 on the basis of our legitimate interests (ie interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online service within the meaning of Art.\n6 (1) lit.\nDSGVO) , USA, (\"Google\").\nGoogle is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active).\nWe use Google's online AdWords marketing tool \"AdWords\" to place ads on the Google advertising network (eg in search results, in videos, on websites, etc.) so that they are displayed to users who have a suspected interest in the ads.\nThis allows us to more specifically display ads for and within our online offering so that we only present ads to users that potentially match their interests.\nFor example, if a user sees ads for products he's been looking for on other online offerings, that's called remarketing.\nFor these purposes, upon access to our and other websites where the Google Advertising Network is active, Google will immediately execute a Google code and become so-called (re) marketing tags (invisible graphics or code, also known as \"web beacons\") incorporated into the website.\nWith their help, the user can store an individual cookie, ie a small file (instead of cookies, comparable technologies can also be used).\nIn this file is noted which websites the user visited, for what content he is interested and what offers the user has clicked, as well as technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visit time and other information on the use of the online offer.\nFurthermore, we receive an individual \"conversion cookie\".\nThe information obtained through the cookie is used by Google to generate conversion statistics for us.\nHowever, we only hear the anonymous total number of users who clicked on our ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page.\nHowever, we do not receive any information that personally identifies users.\nThe data of the users are pseudonym processed within the Google advertising network.\nFor example, Google does not store and process users' names or e-mail addresses, but processes the relevant data in a cookie-related manner within pseudonymous user profiles.\nThat is, from the perspective of Google, the ads are not managed and displayed to a specifically identified person, but to the cookie owner, regardless of who that cookie owner is.\nThis does not apply if a user has explicitly allowed Google to process the data without this pseudonymization.\nThe information collected about users is transmitted to Google and stored on Google's servers in the United States.\nFor more information about Google's data usage, hiring and disparaging options, please read Google's Privacy Policy (https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads) and Google's Ads Ads Settings (https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated).\n<b> BING ADS\n</b>\nBased on our legitimate interests (ie interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art.\n6 (1) lit.\nDSGVO), we base our online offer on the conversion and tracking tool \"Bing Ads\" Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA.\nMicrosoft stores cookies on the users' devices in order to allow users to analyze the use of our online offer as long as users have accessed our online offer via a Microsoft Bing ad (so-called \"conversion measurement\").\nMicrosoft and we can thus recognize that someone clicked on an ad, was redirected to our online offer, and reached a previously determined landing page (called the \"conversion page\").\nWe only hear the total number of users who clicked on a Bing ad and were then redirected to the conversion page.\nNo IP addresses are stored.\nNo personal information on the identity of the users is given.\nMicrosoft is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000KzNaAAK&amp;status=Active).\nIf users do not want to participate in the Bing Ads tracking process, you may opt out of setting a cookie by browser setting or using the Microsoft opt-out page: http://choice.microsoft.com/en-us/opt-out.\nFor more information about privacy and cookies on Microsoft Bing Ads, please refer to the Microsoft Privacy Policy: https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement.\n<b> ONLINE PRESENCES IN SOCIAL MEDIA\n</b>\nWe maintain online presence within social networks and platforms in order to communicate with customers, prospects and users active there and to inform them about our services.\nWe point out that data of the users outside the area of the European Union can be processed.\nThis may result in risks for the users because e.g.\nenforcement of user rights could be made more difficult.\nWith respect to US providers certified under the Privacy Shield, we point out that they are committed to respecting EU privacy standards.\nFurthermore, the data of the users are usually processed for market research and advertising purposes.\nThus, e.g.\nuser profiles are created from the user behavior and the resulting interests of the users.\nThe usage profiles can in turn be used to e.g.\nPlace advertisements inside and outside the platforms that are allegedly in line with users' interests.\nFor these purposes, cookies are usually stored on the computers of the users, in which the user behavior and the interests of the users are stored.\nFurthermore, in the usage profiles, data can also be stored independently of the devices used by the users (in particular if the users are members of the respective platforms and logged in to them).\nThe processing of the personal data of users is based on our legitimate interests in an effective information of users and communication with users in accordance with.\nArt.\n6 para.\n1 lit.\nf.\nDSGVO.\nIf the users are asked by the respective providers for a consent to the data processing (that is, they declare their agreement, for example, by ticking a check box or confirming a button), the legal basis of the processing is Art.\n6 para.\na., Art.\n7 GDPR.\nFor a detailed description of the respective processing and the possibilities of contradiction (opt-out), we refer to the following linked information of the provider.\nAlso in the case of requests for information and the assertion of user rights, we point out that these can be claimed most effectively from the providers.\nOnly the providers have access to the data of the users and can directly take appropriate measures and provide information.\nIf you still need help, then you can contact us.\n- Facebook (Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square,
