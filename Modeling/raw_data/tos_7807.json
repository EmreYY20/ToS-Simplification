\u2013 types <p>As we have mentioned, cookies represent a technology that saves data and collects them from the devices which you use to visit our Website or use the Service.</p>\n<p>Aside from cookies on the Website and within the Service, we and the providers of the tools and services that we use apply other technologies that allow to save information in your system/web browser through data storage (Session Storage, Local Storage, IndexedDB) as well as Tags.</p>\n<p>See below for a description of the types of cookies and similar technologies.</p> TECHNOLOGY TYPE DESCRIPTION of application Session cookies Session cookies are created in the system-user browser each time a user session is created, i.e.\nafter the browser connects with the site.<br> Session cookies expire after the user session expires \u2013 e.g, after the web browser window is closed.\nThe information contained in session cookies are then automatically deleted.\nPersistent cookies Persistent cookies are created in the system \u2013 in the user\u2019s browser after the first visit on the site or after completing a certain action.<br> Unlike session cookies, persistent cookies are not deleted upon the end of the user\u2019s session.\nPersistent cookies are deleted by the user\u2019s browser automatically after a&nbsp;specific period.\nThey can also be deleted manually by the user.\nSession Storage Data storage with the same function as cookies but with much larger data capacity (cookies have limitations connected with their quantity and the quantity of the data they can contain).\nInformation from Session Storage is recorded and read only if clearly requested by the server, and sent to the website user\u2019s browser.\nThe data gathered in Session Storage are deleted just like session cookies \u2013 after the browser window is closed.\nLocal Storage Data storage for information that are kept permanently in the system/web browser of the user until deleted.\nData saved in Local Storage are not automatically available through the web server presenting a particular site but by relevant scripts (java script, flash) placed on the website or sent to the user\u2019s browser from other servers (e.g.\nthrough placement of a&nbsp;partial code coming from another web server \u2013 Facebook, Twitter, Google social media icons).\nIndexedDB Data storage representing an internal database of a web browser that is used to store large data quantities.\nThe storage makes it possible to store data in a&nbsp;structured form and as files.\nData stored as objects to which access is limited only for specific data sources \u2013 the domains or subdomains from which they were saved.\nTags Partial codes of the analytical tools that permit saving cookies or other technologies in the domains of those tools.\nMost tags simply describe the content of the page, but certain types of tags contain programmatic elements or inject dynamic content like video or audio files into the page.\n<p>The usage of third-party cookies and similar technologies on our Website and within the Service takes place on the terms set out in privacy policies of providers who generate such cookies or similar technologies.\nThese third-party services are outside of our control.\nThe providers may, at any time, change their terms of services, purpose of use of cookies and other similar technologies.\nThe current list of our partners whose services we use or whose technologies we place on the Website or in the Service and information about is available here.</p>\n<p>For instance, in the area of the Website we use the services provided by HotJar Ltd., which involve providing aggregate information in the form of a heatmap and conversion path, recording the User\u2019s movements on the site, conducting research and surveys on our websites.\nThe privacy protection rules for the HotJar service are available on https://www.hotjar.com/privacy.\nAccording to the privacy protection rules, HotJar\u2019s service does not entail collecting and processing any User information considered as Personal Data.</p> 3 Why do we use cookies and similar technologies? <p>We use cookies and similar technologies to improve performance and offer our Website, Service and Mobile App users further functionality improvements.\nAnalysis of the data saved based on the use of cookies and similar

allowed Company to save such a referral cookie.\nThe Affiliate is not entitled to the Commission for the purchases of the Service through their own referral link - this means that the Affiliate will not receive the Commission for the purchase of the Service made by the Affiliate himself/herself, their corporation, employer or the like or any other entity which controls, is controlled by or is under&nbsp;common control with, the Affiliate.&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes also any purchases made not under Affiliate\u2019s name but with the use of Affiliate\u2019s payment medium (e.g.\ncredit card,

(depending on the Affiliate\u2019s domicile/residence).\nIf on the last day of the month the balance owing in the account is less than the aforesaid limit, the Commission will be accumulated in the

unless the Affiliate provides the Company with accurate and complete contact and tax details.</li>\n<li>The Affiliate acknowledges and agrees that all the sums of Commissions payable under the Program are calculated jointly for the purpose of fulfillment of tax obligations.\n</li>\n<li>The Company reserves the right to change the Commission rate and Service prices at any time.\nAny Commissions accrued after such a change will be at the new rate.\n\u2028</li>\n</ol> VI.\nRefunds/Chargebacks/Fraud\u2028 <ol>\n<li>Any customer refunds, reversals or credit card chargebacks owed by the Company to the referred customer will result in the appropriate Commission amount being deducted from the Affiliate's account balance <strong>(\"Deducted Commission\")</strong>.\nIf the Commission from that sale has already been paid to the Affiliate, the amount will be deducted from future payments of the Commissions.\nIf the Commission owed to the Affiliate in the next month is not sufficient to

any Commission earned.</li>\n<li>If an account of customer referred by Affiliate is terminated due to practices or actions that GetResponse considers to be abusive, prohibited or that violate

referring the terminated customer.\nIf the number of terminated customer accounts referred by Affiliate is abnormal or GetResponse may reasonably suspect that it is a part of fraudulent activity, GetResponse shall have the right, at its sole discretion, to forfeit not only Commissions earned for referring terminated customers, but all Commissions earned (regardless of whether paid or outstanding) by Affiliate during the term of Agreement.\nAs regards settlement rules section 1 and 2 above shall apply accordingly, i.e.\nGetResponse is entitled in particular to deduct relevant
