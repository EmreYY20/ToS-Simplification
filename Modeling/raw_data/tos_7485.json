1.3.\nUser account In order to access and use certain sections and features of the AbcSubmit Services, you must first register and create an account with AbcSubmit (\u201cUser Account\u201d).<p>\n</p>\n<p>If anyone other than yourself accesses your User Account and/or any of your User Platforms\u2019 settings, they may perform any actions available to you (unless as specifically stated otherwise on the AbcSubmit Services), make changes to your User Platform(s) and User Account, and accept any legal terms available therein, make various representations and warranties and more \u2013 and all such activities will be deemed to have occurred on your behalf and in your name.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we strongly encourage you to keep the log-in credentials of your User Account confidential, and allow such access only to people you trust \u2013 as you will be solely and fully responsible for all activities that occur under your User Account and/or User Platforms (including for any representations, warranties and undertakings made therein), whether or not specifically authorized by you, and for any damages, expenses or losses that may result from such activities.</p>\n<p>You must provide accurate and complete information when registering your User Account and using the AbcSubmit Services, to which you are the sole and exclusive rights holder.\nWe strongly encourage you to provide your own (or your company\u2019s) contact and billing details, including your valid e-mail address, as we may use it to identify and determine the actual and true owner of the User Account and/or User Content (as defined below) submitted to us.</p>\n<p>In case of a dispute on User Account ownership, we reserve the right to determine ownership to a User Account based on our reasonable judgment, whether or not an independent investigation has been conducted by us.\nHowever, if we cannot make such determination (as we may deem in our sole discretion), we reserve the right to avoid doing so and/or suspend a User Account until the parties disputing such ownership, reach a resolution, without liability to you or to any other party.\nWe may request documentation (e.g.\ngovernment-issued ID, a business license) that may assist us in determining ownership.\nAmong others, we may consider the principles set forth below.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>AbcSubmit will consider the owner of a User Account, User Platform and/or User Content created and/or uploaded to the relevant AbcSubmit Service, as the person or entity who has access to the e-mail address then listed in AbcSubmit\u2019s records for such User Account under which such User Platform or User Content was created.</li>\n<li>If any Paid Services (as defined in Section 5 below) were purchased via a User Account, AbcSubmit will consider the owner of such User Account and/or the relevant User Platform and/or User Content created thereunder, may be considered to be the person or entity whose billing details were used to purchase such Paid Services (\u201cBilling Information\u201d).\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, when applicable if a User Platform was connected to an external domain name (either imported or purchased as part of certain Paid Services, as defined below), and such domain\u2019s registration information is publicly available via the WHOIS database provided on the www.whois.net website or on AbcSubmit\u2019s database, AbcSubmit will consider the owner of such User Platform as the person or entity registered as the registrant of such domain thereunder.\nIn the event that an individual and an organization are both registered as the registrant or the registrant organization of such domain, AbcSubmit will consider the organization as the actual owner of the domain, and therefore as the owner of the User Platform connected to such domain.\nIn event the Billing Information indicates one person as the owner of the User Platform and the domain registration indicates a different owner, AbcSubmit shall consider the person registered as the owner of the domain connected to the AbcSubmit Account as the owner of the User Platform.</li>\n<li>Notwithstanding the forgoing, AbcSubmit shall have the right to determine the ownership of User Content and/or a User Website as it chooses, including by ignoring the indications set forth above, in event AbcSubmit deems, at its sole discretion, that the situation justifies such determination, all based upon the factual situation as determined by AbcSubmit.</li>\n</ol> To use certain of our services, you need to create a user account.<p>\n</p>\n<p>You should keep your username and password protected and safe, and only allow people you trust to access your account or website settings.</p>\n<p>All activities that occur under your user account or website are your responsibility.</p>\n<p>The account information you provide us must be your own (or your company\u2019s), and be accurate and complete.</p>\n<p>When a user account is disputed, we may determine the ownership of such user account.</p> 2.\nYour obligations\n2.1.\nYou represent and warrant that: <ol>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>you are at

the applicable Fees using the payment method you have on file with AbcSubmit, within two (2) weeks before such renewal period commences.\nIn the event of failure to collect the Fees owed by you, we may in our sole discretion (but shall not be obligated to) retry to collect on a later time, and/or suspend or cancel your User Account, without further notice.\nIf your Paid Service is subject to a yearly or multiple-year subscription period, AbcSubmit will endeavor to provide you a notice prior to the renewal of such Paid Service at least thirty (30) days in advance of the renewal date.</p>\n<p>You may turn-off the auto-renewal option or cancel your Paid Services at any time via your User Account by migrating to a Free paid plan.</p>\n<p>Certain domains are subject to a different renewal policy as detailed in the Domains Registration Agreement.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, you are and shall be solely responsible to verify and ensure the successful renewal of the AbcSubmit Services you use (whether or not such AbcSubmit Services are subject to automatic subscription renewals).\nAccordingly, you shall be solely responsible with respect to any discontinuation of any AbcSubmit Services previously purchased by you, including due to a cancellation, failure to charge the applicable recurring Fees, or due to any AbcSubmit Services not being subject to automatic subscription renewals.\nYou acknowledge and agree that you shall not have any claims against AbcSubmit in relation to the discontinuation of any AbcSubmit Services or Third Party Services, for whatever reason.</p>\nTo make sure you don\u2019t lose your domain or experience interruptions with your website at the end of your subscription period, we\u2019ll&nbsp;<b>automatically renew it</b>.<p>\n</p>\n<p>Some services whether on purpose or mistake may not automatically renew.\nYou should make sure that your subscriptions are renewed in time.</p> 5.4.\nMoney-Back Guarantee If you are not satisfied with AbcSubmit Services that are subject to a Fee for a period of service or subscription commitment and which is your initial purchase of such service, you may provide notice of cancellation for any reason within thirty (30) days of having first ordered or activated such AbcSubmit Services (the \u201cRefund\u201d and \u201cRefund Period\u201d).\nThe Refund is applicable only to the initial purchase of AbcSubmit services which is an upgrading of a free website by purchasing a Premium Plan (as offered on the AbcSubmit Website).\nThe Refund is not applicable to any additional purchases, upgrades, modification or renewals of AbcSubmit Services.\nIf you reside in a jurisdiction which requires a longer Refund Period, we will of course be happy to accommodate such requirements in accordance with all applicable laws.\nIf AbcSubmit receives such notice within such Refund Period, AbcSubmit will refund to you the amount AbcSubmit charged you for such AbcSubmit Services, in currency you were originally charged in, and cancel them accordingly.\nPlease note that the Refund amount may be different than the amount you were charged due to currency changes and third party fees.\nAbcSubmit will not be responsible for any differences caused by change of currency exchange rates or fees you were charged by third parties.\nAfter the Refund Period, the Fees paid by you are non-refundable and non-cancellable.\nIn addition, if we find that a notice of cancellation has been given in bad faith or in an illegitimate attempt to avoid payment for services actually received and enjoyed, we reserve our right to still charge the User who provided such notice for any AbcSubmit Services actually received, as permitted by law.<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Please note</b>: Certain services purchased on or through the AbcSubmit Services may be non-refundable.\nThese include Third Party Services such as domains, business tools and applications.\nThe terms of each purchased service or application are indicated on the AbcSubmit Website and/or as part of or during the process of purchasing such services or applications.\nIt is your obligation to verify your ability to cancel a service prior to purchasing it.\nAbcSubmit will not refund any amounts paid for non-refundable Paid Services, applications or Third Party Services.</p>\nWe are happy to offer a 30-day money-back guarantee for our monthly or annual paid services when first purchased.\nThis may be extended according to the law.<p>\n</p>\n<p>Please carefully check the terms of each service before buying, since some services are non-refundable.</p> 5.5.\nChargebacks If, at any time, we record a decline, chargeback or other rejection of a charge of any payable Fees on your AbcSubmit account (\u201c<b>Chargeback</b>\u201d), this will be considered as a breach of your payment obligations hereunder, and your use of the AbcSubmit Services may be automatically disabled or terminated.<p>\n</p>\n<p>In the event a Chargeback is performed, your User Account may be blocked without the option to re-purchase or re-use it, and any data contained in such User Account, including any domains, applications and Third Party Services may be subject to cancellation and Capacity Loss (as defined in Section 6.3 below).</p>\n<p>Your use of the AbcSubmit Services will not resume until you re-subscribe for any such AbcSubmit Services, and pay any applicable Fees in full, including any fees and expenses incurred by AbcSubmit and/or any Third Party Services for each Chargeback received (including Fees for AbcSubmit Services provided prior to the Chargeback, handling and processing charges and fees incurred by the payment processor).</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding a payment made to AbcSubmit,&nbsp;<b>we encourage you to first contact our Customer Support team before filing a Chargeback or reversal of payment</b>, in order to prevent the AbcSubmit Services from being cancelled and your User Account being blocked, and to avoid the filing of an unwarranted or erroneous Chargeback, which may result in your being liable for its applicable Fees, in addition to re-payment of all the Fees applicable to the AbcSubmit Services purchased (and charged-back) by you.</p>\n<p>We reserve our right to dispute any Chargeback received, including by providing the relevant credit card company or financial institution with any information and documentation proving that the User responsible for such Chargeback did in fact authorize the transaction and make use of the services rendered thereafter.</p>\nChargebacks may bring us to cancel your account, so we urge you to avoid causing them.<p>\n</p>\n<p>Please contact our Customer Support team before filing a chargeback.\nYou will be responsible for any incorrect fees, losses and expenses that follow.</p> 6.\nCancellation\n6.1.\nCancellation by User You may discontinue to use and request to cancel your User Account and/or any AbcSubmit Services at any time, in accordance with the instructions available on the AbcSubmit Services.\nThe effective date and

(e.g., Paid Services) or Third Party Services to you.\nIf you violate any of these terms or fail to make timely payments, we may suspend or cancel your account.\n6.3.\nLoss of Data, Content and Capacity If your User Account or any AbcSubmit Services or Third Party Services related to your User Account are cancelled (whether at your request or at AbcSubmit\u2019s discretion), it may cause or
