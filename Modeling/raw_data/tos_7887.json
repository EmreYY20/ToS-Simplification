must deposit funds prior to placing an Order and you are not permitted to place an Order unless you have enough funds in your Gemini Account to satisfy your Order (i.e., all Orders are pre-funded).\nWhen you place an Order, the full amount of funds required (including any fees) are placed on hold in your Gemini Account until your Order fills, expires, or is canceled.\nAny unfilled portion of your Order will remain on hold until it fills, expires, or is canceled.&nbsp;You agree that it is your responsibility to cancel any Order (in whole or in part) that you do not want to be filled.\nYou understand that you may not be able to cancel an Order prior to it filling (in whole or in part) and that we are not liable to you for the completion of an Order after you have submitted

application (the \u201cMobile Application\u201d and each, a \u201cMobile Order\u201d) are subject to each and every other provision of this User Agreement unless otherwise modified by this subsection.\nYou also agree and understand that Mobile Orders are handled differently than Orders placed via our API or the Gemini ActiveTrader\u2122 interface, both of which interact directly with our Exchange.\nSpecifically, you further agree and understand that all Mobile Orders either: (i) execute against a principal market maker that is a Gemini Service Provider and affiliate (the \u201cLiquidity Provider\u201d), or (ii) are placed and, if conditions allow, executed on your behalf on our Exchange by the Liquidity Provider as an agency broker.\nYou also agree and understand that the Liquidity Provider reserves the right to reject any Mobile Order for any reason, including, but not limited to, rejecting a Mobile Order if it determines that it is unable to execute against it as a principal market maker because underlying market conditions, pricing, or other circumstances and risk factors have changed.\nSimilarly, you agree and understand that the Liquidity Provider may reject any Mobile Order if it is unable to execute it on your behalf on our Exchange as an agency broker due to the market price moving such that the Mobile Order cannot be executed at or better than the specified price, the Mobile Order exceeds the maximum Mobile Order size limit on our Exchange, or Downtime.\nIn any event, and absent unexpected technological interruptions or Downtime, a Mobile Order will not be pending for more than 60 seconds.\nthat is, you will generally receive either a notice of execution or a notice of rejection within 60 seconds of placing a Mobile Order.\nYou further

gives rise to certain potential or actual conflicts of interest.\nWithout limitation, these conflicts include the fact that we have not established and do not intend to establish relationships with unaffiliated liquidity providers, for purposes of the Mobile Application, regardless of whether the terms and fees offered by such unaffiliated liquidity providers are more favorable to users of the Mobile Application.\nIn addition, we may share various resources with the Liquidity Provider, including, but not limited to, office space, personnel, and systems.You agree and understand that all Mobile Orders are subject to our&nbsp;Mobile Fee Schedule&nbsp;and that fees for Mobile Orders are not the same as, and may be higher than, fees for Orders placed via our API or the Gemini

be paid to, the Liquidity Provider.You agree and understand that Mobile Orders may impact the liquidity conditions that may otherwise be available on our Exchange and that should the volume or frequency of Mobile Orders increase or decrease, liquidity in our Exchange may similarly increase or decrease.Order Placement by Website ApplicationYou agree and understand that orders placed via our

applicable, and that the affiliation between the Liquidity Provider and Gemini gives rise to certain potential or actual conflicts of interest.\nWithout limitation, these conflicts include the fact that we have not established and do not intend to establish relationships with unaffiliated liquidity providers, for purposes of the Web Application, regardless of whether the terms and fees offered by such unaffiliated liquidity providers are more favorable to users of the Web Application.\nIn addition, we may share various resources with the Liquidity Provider, including, but not limited to,

ProvidersYou are permitted to use our API via a third-party order execution management system (\u201cOEMS\u201d) service provider or another type of third-party service provider (each, an \u201c OEMS Service Provider\u201d) to route your Orders to our Exchange and modify your Orders previously submitted to our Exchange (\u201cOEMS Services\u201d), however, you agree and understand that any such OEMS Service Provider must first be authorized by us to provide OEMS Services, and such authorization will only be granted by us to an OEMS Service Provider that enters into an OEMS Service Provider agreement (each, an \u201cOEMS Service Provider Agreement\u201d) with Gemini Trust Company, LLC.\nAll OEMS Service Providers are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in such OEMS Service Provider Agreement, as well as the terms and conditions set forth in this User Agreement, our API Agreement, and our Market Data Agreement.You agree to be responsible for all Orders and Order modifications placed on our Exchange through or by an OEMS Service Provider using your Gemini Account ID, you agree and understand that all such Orders will be treated as your Orders for all purposes, and you agree to accept and be bound in all respects by the terms of all Trades executed on our Exchange as a result of any Orders or instructions routed to our Exchange through or by an OEMS Service Provider using your Gemini Account ID, regardless of whether such Orders or instructions were submitted to our Exchange by an OEMS Service Provider in error.You agree and understand that you are solely responsible (and you will not hold us responsible) for managing and maintaining the security of your User Account login credentials and any other required forms of authentication, including your API keys, even if you share them with an authorized OEMS Service Provider.\nYou also agree and understand that we are not responsible (and you will not hold us responsible) for any unauthorized access to or use of your User Account and/or your Gemini Account, even if you share some or all of your login credentials and other required forms of authentication, including your API keys, with an authorized OEMS Service Provider.\nYou further agree that in no event will we be liable to you for any damages, costs, or other liability in the event of (i) any Downtime, systems failure, error,

(iii) any errors or delays with respect to Orders or instructions submitted to our Exchange by or through an OEMS Service Provider, or (iv) other matters related to OEMS Services made available to you

place Orders and Order modifications on our Exchange via an OEMS Service Provider, for any reason and at any time, as determined in our sole discretion.Order HandlingYou agree and understand that we do not guarantee that any Order you place will be filled.\nOrders that are active before Downtime (as defined herein), will be handled, once our Exchange resumes operations, as follows:<ul>\n<li>If the Order was placed via an API key with the \u201cRequires Heartbeat\u201d feature activated it will be automatically canceled.</li>\n<li>If the Order was placed via the website interface, or via an API key without using the \u201cRequires Heartbeat\u201d feature, it will be active once our Exchange resumes operations.</li>\n<li>If you connect via FIX, you have the option of enabling \u201ccancel upon disconnect\u201d for all of your Orders.\nIf you, or your technology provider (e.g., OEMS provider) do not enable \u201ccancel upon disconnect,\u201d you agree and understand that we are not responsible for your Orders executing at disadvantageous prices or any other losses associated with your Orders not being cancelled during Downtime.</li>\n</ul>You agree and understand that we reserve the right to cancel any Order, or remaining portion of any Order, if:<ul>\n<li>Any such Order was placed and/or active during Downtime;</li>\n<li>Any such Order triggers our Marketplace Controls.\nor</li>\n<li>Any such Order is materially non-marketable.</li>\n</ul>You agree and understand that Orders may be subject to, and we shall have no liability for, delays, difficulties, and/or conditions affecting transmission or execution of Orders over which we have no control, including, but not limited to, mechanical or electronic failure or market congestion.<br>\n<br>You agree and understand that contingent Orders, including, but not limited to, \u201cStop\u201d and \u201cStop-Limit\u201d Orders, will not necessarily limit your losses to the intended amounts, since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such Orders at a price close to the Stop Price or at all.<br>\n<br>You agree and understand that we reserve the right to require all Orders to pass automated compliance checks.\nIf your Order is flagged for review by any of these checks or if it meets certain defined criteria, it may require our manual review and approval.\nWe will use commercially reasonable efforts to review such Orders on a timely basis, but we are not liable for any delays.\nIf at any time you are in any doubt about the status of your Order, you can view your Order status on Gemini.\nWe may cancel any Order flagged for review.\nLastly, we may require you to confirm your Order via telephone or another form of authentication prior to execution.Order

has been placed, we will send you an email confirming your Order (each, an \u201cOrder Receipt\u201d), and an another email if your Order subsequently fills (in whole or in part) (each, a \u201cTrade Receipt\u201d).Orders Receipts contain the following information:<ul>\n<li>The Order date, type, ID, amount, and pricing information if applicable;</li>\n<li>A notification which states that you have

for Gemini should you have any questions, need to register a complaint, or claim that your Trade was not authorized (subject to applicable limits described herein).</li>\n</ul>Gemini maintains and retains records of your Transaction History for a period of no less than seven years.Your Orders and Trades shall be deemed and treated as authorized and correct as ratified and confirmed by you unless we receive Written Notice to the contrary within three calendar days.&nbsp;It is your sole responsibility to review your Transaction History, Order Receipts, and Trade Receipts on a regular basis in order to meet the period set forth above.Non-Primary Fiat Currency TransactionsFrom time to time, you may desire to purchase or sell Digital Assets with a fiat currency other than a primary fiat currency (which list Gemini may publish and/or change from time to time).\nThe market for Digital Asset transactions priced in non-primary fiat currencies may not be quoted and/or sufficiently liquid on the Exchange, especially compared to the markets for Digital Asset transactions priced in primary fiat currencies.\nYou agree and understand that, in order for us to execute such a transaction, Gemini may need to enter into a foreign exchange transaction (a \u201cFX transaction\u201d) with a third-party FX provider to exchange your non-primary fiat currency for a primary fiat currency, such as U.S.\ndollars.\nYou authorize us to execute such FX transactions on your behalf, acting solely at our discretion as to timing and price (typically, within one or two Business Days at the current fair market rate).\nYou agree and understand that we will complete your requested Digital Asset transaction on our Exchange using a primary fiat currency, the amount of which will be based on current market data provided by our third-party FX provider.You agree and understand that the FX provider with which we execute FX transactions may be a partner of ours.\nYou further acknowledge and understand that there may be a conflict of interest between you and us with respect to these transactions.\nIn particular, and as an example only, our primary interest is in executing the Digital Asset transaction on our Exchange and we may have an interest in executing FX transactions quickly, even if such executions are not at the best available rates.\nYou further agree and understand that we do not guarantee that you will receive the best possible rate (as compared to prices that may be possible on other execution venues) on the execution of any FX transactions.\nYou further agree and understand that the price quoted to you on the Exchange for the Digital Asset transaction may include, amongst other components, the spread charged by the FX provider.\nTherefore, you agree not to object to or otherwise bring a claim against us or any partner FX provider on the basis of such conflict or other similar issue related to a FX transaction.Gemini Settlement and Gemini ClearingYou agree and understand that the submission, acceptance and funding of bilaterally arranged and negotiated Supported Digital Asset transactions for settlement through Gemini\u2019s trade settlement platform (i.e., the delivery by Gemini of purchased Supported Digital Assets from seller\u2019s Gemini Account to buyer\u2019s Gemini Account and the delivery by Gemini of the corresponding purchase price from buyer\u2019s Gemini Account to seller\u2019s Gemini Account, in each case less any applicable fees owed to Gemini, collectively, \u201cGemini Clearing\u201d), together with the enhanced

PolicyWe consider a transaction to be clearly erroneous when its price is substantially inconsistent with the market price at the time of execution (each, a \u201cClearly Erroneous Transaction\u201d).\nIn making a determination, we take into account the circumstances at the time of the transaction, the preservation of the integrity of the market, and the maintenance of a fair and orderly marketplace.\nYou are responsible for ensuring that the appropriate price and Order type is entered into Gemini.\nA simple assertion that a mistake was made by you in entering an Order, or that you failed to pay attention to or update an Order, is not sufficient to establish it as a Clearly Erroneous Transaction.\nIn the event such User Error results in a Transaction, you should take the following steps:<ol>\n<li>You should make us aware of the error trade in a timely manner (generally within 24 hours of the error trade execution).\nand</li>\n<li>If you transact on behalf of another person or entity, you are responsible for ensuring the person or entity receives a price that is equal to, or better than, the price at which their original order would have otherwise been executed at (in the case where an equal or better price is not available, a cash adjustment to the customer account is sufficient).&nbsp;We bear no responsibility for User Errors.</li>\n</ol>You agree and understand that if we determine a transaction to be a Clearly Erroneous Transaction, we may declare it null and void, in whole or in part, even if you and/or the other party do not agree to cancel or modify it.\nIn the event that we declare a transaction null and void, both parties to the trade must return the Digital Assets and/or fiat currency received in the transaction.In determining whether a transaction is a Clearly Erroneous Transaction, we will consider the following:<ul>\n<li>Suspicious trading activity;</li>\n<li>Violations of our Marketplace Conduct Rules;</li>\n<li>If there was a disruption or malfunction in the operation of any trading system or component of our Exchange, Gemini, a Gemini Service Provider, or a Digital Asset network (\u201cDigital Asset Network\u201d).\nor</li>\n<li>If there were extraordinary market conditions or other circumstances in which the nullification or modification of transactions may be necessary for the maintenance of a fair and orderly market.</li>\n</ul>We will make a determination and take any action pursuant to this Clearly Erroneous Transaction Policy as soon as practicable following a transaction.\nIf you are a party to any action taken, we will notify you via Written Notice as soon as practicable.Credit CardUsing our Credit Card ServicesIf you have a Gemini Credit CardTM account, your use of the Gemini

Protocol</p>\n<p>Yes</p>\n<p>Yes</p>\n<p>Yes</p>You agree and understand that a Digital Asset of an Unsupported Network or a Digital Asset that operates \u201con top of\u201d a Supported Network is not a Supported Digital Asset (each, an \u201cUnsupported Digital Asset\u201d), unless it is explicitly named as a Supported Digital Asset herein.\nYou also agree and understand that we may, in our sole discretion, choose to support an Unsupported Digital Asset and make it a Supported Digital Asset on Gemini at any time.\nYou further agree and understand that we may, in our sole discretion, choose to no longer support a Supported Digital Asset on Gemini and make it an Unsupported Digital Asset at any time.You agree and understand that we are solely responsible for the operation of Gemini, our Exchange, our Custody Services, our Mobile Application, and the provision of other services described in this User Agreement (collectively, \u201cGemini Services\u201d), and for making all decisions and determinations with respect to the Gemini Services.\nSuch decisions and determinations could include, without limitation, the choice to support or not support a Digital Asset or Digital Asset Network, or a change to the terms of trading or transacting on or through Gemini Services in connection with any such Digital Asset or Digital Asset Network.You agree and understand that we and our affiliates, shareholders, controlling persons, principals, directors, managers, officers, employees, and representatives or their respective affiliates (collectively, \u201cRelated Parties\u201d) may directly or indirectly, including through interests in other entities, own, control, lend, borrow, or trade (each, to \u201cTransact\u201d) in a Digital Asset or related financial instruments, including, without limitation, a security, bond, money market, and/or derivative (collectively, \u201cFinancial Instruments\u201d), for their own account or on behalf of other persons or entities, at any time prior to and/or after we choose to support such Digital Asset on the Gemini Services and make it a Supported Digital Asset or increase the scope of the Gemini Services made available for a Digital Asset that is already a Supported Digital Asset.\nYou also agree and understand that we and our Related Parties may Transact in a Digital Asset or related Financial Instruments for their own account or on behalf of other persons or entities, at any time prior to and/or after we choose to no longer support such Digital Asset on the Gemini Services and make it an Unsupported Digital Asset or decrease the scope of the Gemini Services made available for a Digital Asset that is a Supported Digital Asset.You agree and understand that we and our Related Parties may have certain actual or potential conflicts of interest related to our decision to support or not support a Digital Asset or increase or decrease the scope of the Gemini Services made available for such Digital Asset.\nWithout limiting any of our obligations to you under this User Agreement and to the extent permitted by law, you hereby agree to waive any claim or other similar cause of action, whether direct or indirect, against us or our Related Parties, in which there is asserted a breach of fiduciary duties, conflict of interest, or other similar violation or offense with respect to, or arising out of, us and/or our Related Parties Transacting in Digital Assets or related Financial Instruments, as described herein.You agree and understand that we may use our own services, including the Gemini Services.\nYou further agree and understand that our Related Parties may be Gemini Customers and may use the services offered by us to Gemini Customers, including without limitation, the Gemini Services.ForksYou agree and understand that the underlying protocols of Supported Networks are subject to changes in operating rules (each a \u201cFork\u201d) that may result in more than one version (each, a \u201cForked Network\u201d) and us holding a specified amount of Digital Assets associated with each Forked Network.\nYou further agree and understand that Forks may materially affect the value, function, and/or name of the Digital Assets you hold on Gemini.In the event of a Fork, you agree and understand that we may temporarily suspend the operations of Gemini (with or without advance notice to you) while we choose, in our sole discretion, except as described herein, which Forked Networks to support.&nbsp;You agree and understand that in our best estimation we are unlikely to support most Forked Networks and that the Digital Assets of most Forked Networks will likely not be made available to you.DIGITAL ASSET VALUES CAN FLUCTUATE SUBSTANTIALLY WHICH MAY RESULT IN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE VALUE OF DIGITAL ASSETS HELD BY US ON YOUR BEHALF.\nTHE SUPPLY OF DIGITAL ASSETS AVAILABLE TO US TO PROVIDE TO YOU AS A RESULT OF A FORKED NETWORK AND OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER DIGITAL ASSETS RESULTING FROM A FORKED NETWORK MAY DEPEND ON THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL.\nWE DO NOT OWN OR CONTROL ANY OF THE PROTOCOLS THAT ARE USED IN CONNECTION WITH DIGITAL ASSETS AND THEIR RELATED DIGITAL ASSET NETWORKS, INCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM A FORKED NETWORK.\nACCORDINGLY, WE DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY RELATING TO SUCH PROTOCOLS AND ANY CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF ANY DIGITAL ASSETS (WHETHER OF A FORKED NETWORK OR OTHERWISE), AND WE MAKE NO GUARANTEES REGARDING THE SECURITY, FUNCTIONALITY, OR AVAILABILITY OF SUCH PROTOCOLS OR DIGITAL ASSET NETWORKS.\nYOU ACCEPT ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF GEMINI TO CONDUCT TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IN CONNECTION WITH THE FAILURE OF HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND INTERNET CONNECTIONS.In the event of a Fork of a Supported Network, we will support the Forked Network that requires the greatest total threshold number of hash attempts to mine all existing blocks measured during the 48-hour period following a Fork (the \u201cGreatest Cumulative Computational Difficulty\u201d) and will retain the name and ticker of the Digital Asset that existed prior to the Fork.\nYou agree and understand that we may, in our sole discretion, suspend operations, in whole or in part (with or without advance notice), for however long we deem necessary, while we make this determination.\nIf we are unable to make a conclusive determination as to which Forked Network has the Greatest Cumulative Computational Difficulty, or if we determine in good faith that Greatest Cumulative Computational Difficulty is not a reasonable criterion upon which to make a determination, we will support the Forked Network that we deem in good faith is most likely to be supported by the greatest number of users and miners and will retain the name and ticker of the Digital Asset that existed prior to the Fork.\nWe may also support the other Forked Network, in which case we will call its Digital Asset by a different name and use a different ticker.Unsupported Forked NetworksYou agree and understand that we may choose, in our sole discretion, except as described herein, not to support a Forked Network (each, an \u201cUnsupported Forked Network\u201d) and that you have no right, claim, or other privilege to any Digital Assets of an Unsupported Forked Network.\nWith respect to an Unsupported Forked Network, we will treat its Digital Assets as Unsupported Digital Assets and we may, in our sole discretion, elect to:<ol>\n<li>Abandon or otherwise not pursue obtaining these Unsupported Digital Assets;</li>\n<li>Determine your balance at the time of the Fork, account for the resulting Digital Assets as your property, and make them available to you via a one-time withdrawal mechanism (\u201cOne-Time Withdrawal\u201d) (subject to the withholding and retention by us of any amount reasonably necessary, as determined in our sole discretion, to fairly compensate us for the efforts expended to make such Digital Assets available).&nbsp;Please Note: A One-Time Withdrawal does not make an Unsupported Forked Network a Supported Network or its Digital Assets Supported Digital Assets.\nor</li>\n<li>In rare circumstances, pursue and retain the resulting Digital Assets as property belonging solely to us.\nHowever, with respect to any Unsupported Forked Network that we subsequently decide to treat as a Supported Network, we will make such Digital Assets available to you (and will not retain such Digital Assets as property belonging to us).</li>\n</ol>You agree and understand that we will only give Written Notice if we elect to pursue option (B).You agree and understand that If you wish to ensure access to Digital Assets related to both Forked Networks following a Fork, or an Airdrop (as defined herein), you must withdraw your Digital Assets from Gemini prior to any Fork or Airdrop.Please note:&nbsp;If we decide to support an Unsupported Forked Network and its Digital Assets in the future, we will determine your balance at the time of the Fork (minus any applicable One-Time Withdrawals) and account for it as your property, which will be reflected in your Digital Asset Account.Unsolicited TransfersYou agree and understand that in the event that you or a third party deposits Unsupported Digital Assets into a Digital Asset address that we control, we have the right to and will account for any such Unsupported Digital Assets as our property.You agree and understand that in the event that a third party deposits Supported Digital Assets into a Digital Asset address that we control, we have the right to and will account for any such Supported Digital Assets as follows:<ol>\n<li>Your property if sent to your Depository Account or Custody Account.\nor</li>\n<li>Our property, belonging solely to us, if sent to any other Digital Asset address that we control.</li>\n</ol>You further agree and understand that the types of transfers described in this section (each an \u201cUnsolicited Transfer\u201d) do not create or represent any relationship between us and the sender and do not subject us to any obligations whatsoever as they relate to the sender.You further agree and understand that we have absolutely no obligation or duty to return the Digital Assets of an Unsolicited Transfer.\nAirdropsYou agree and understand that in the event that a Digital Asset Network attempts to or does distribute (sometimes called \u201cairdropping\u201d or \u201cbootstrapping\u201d) its Digital Assets to Digital Asset addresses of a Supported Network, we will treat this Digital Asset Network as an Unsupported Forked Network.You further agree and understand that airdropped Digital Assets do not create or represent any relationship between us and the sender and/or the related Digital Asset Network and do not subject us to any obligations whatsoever as they relate to the sender and/or the related Digital Asset Network.Gemini DollarBy obtaining or using the Gemini Dollar (in this section, \u201cyou\u201d), you understand and expressly agree to the terms and conditions of this section, regardless of whether or not you are a Gemini Customer, and you acknowledge that you have reviewed and

established specifically for the benefit of Gemini Customers.\n(iv) managed by a registered financial advisor, (v) custodied by a qualified custodian.\nand (vi) the monies within which are used to purchase money market funds invested in securities issued or guaranteed by the United States or certain U.S.\ngovernment agencies or instrumentalities.&nbsp;You agree and understand that Gemini Dollar Money Market Accounts do not create or represent any relationship between you and any of the related registered financial advisors and/or qualified custodians.Each Gemini Dollar Treasury Account is held at a financial institution: (i) in our name, and under our control.\n(ii) separate from our business, operating, and reserve investment accounts.\n(iii) established specifically for the benefit

the option to \u201cstake\u201d these assets in a proof of stake network via staking services provided by Gemini or a third-party service provider (\u201cStaking Services Provider\u201d).\nPlease visit our staking information page for further details on how proof of stake works.&nbsp;Gemini Staking Services are not currently available to New York customers or customers in certain other jurisdictions.The Supported Digital Assets eligible for staking services are subject to change at any time.&nbsp;Staked assets are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections.The Service.\nRewards.\nServices Fee.\nLimitationsIf you instruct Gemini to stake your assets, Gemini or a Staking Services Provider will facilitate the staking of those assets on your behalf by acting as a transaction validator on the applicable network for the Supported Digital Asset you stake.\nIf Gemini or the Staking Services Provider successfully validates a block of transactions in that Supported Digital Asset, you will earn a reward granted by that Supported Digital Asset\u2019s network.\nThe timing and amount of your reward will be determined by the protocols of the applicable network.\nGemini does not determine the timing or amount of your reward.Gemini will distribute any earned rewards to you after receipt by Gemini, minus a Staking Services Fee of 15% of the rewards determined by the protocol.\nSome of the Staking Services Feei is used to pay \u2018gas\u2019 fees associated with staking and the remainder is retained by Gemini.\nYou can view the protocol rewards from this FAQ page.\nSome Digital Asset networks subject staked assets to \u201cslashing\u201d if the transaction validator representing those assets incorrectly validates a transaction.\nGemini and/or the Staking Services Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent any staked assets from slashing.\nhowever, in the event they are, unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, Gemini will promptly replace your assets at no additional cost.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, Gemini will not replace assets subject to slashing as a result of network, network provider, or operator errors, or any other basis covered by the Disclaimer of Liability or Force Majeure sections below.Some Digital Asset Networks may impose a waiting period while staking, during which your staked assets will be restricted from transfer or sale (\u201cUnbonding Period\u201d).&nbsp;If you instruct Gemini to unstake your assets, you will not have access to your assets until the expiration of any applicable Unbonding Period.&nbsp;Gemini may also impose an additional waiting period in order to facilitate transfer of your assets to your Gemini Account after the expiration of any applicable Unbonding Period.&nbsp;If rewards are collected on your staked assets during an Unbonding Period, Gemini will credit these rewards to your Gemini Account.No Guarantee of Rewards.\nYou have no right to a reward until it is received by Gemini.\nRewards will be distributed to your account promptly after they are received by Gemini from the relevant protocol.\nUnless otherwise specified, the \u201cstaking rewards rate\u201d disclosed by Gemini for a particular Supported Digital Asset is an annualized historical rate based on the staking rewards generated by Gemini and/or the Staking Services Provider in providing staking services to Gemini customers for that Supported Digital Asset over the last ninety (90) days.\nThis rate is an estimate and may change over time.\nGEMINI DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE ANY STAKING REWARDS, INCLUDING THE STAKING REWARDS RATES.Governance and Voting.\nFor certain Digital Assets, the underlying protocols offer stakers the ability to vote on matters related to the governance of protocol-level issues.\nGemini may or may not support voting for such assets, and may cease supporting voting at any time in its discretion.\nIn certain cases, Gemini may vote on your behalf where Gemini or the applicable protocol does not support delegated voting.\nIn such instances, Gemini will vote in favor of the decision that it believes supports the most use cases for Gemini users.Ethereum Staking.\nIf you instruct Gemini to stake your ETH, the amount you designate will become bonded to the Ethereum protocol and unavailable for withdrawal until the appropriate phase of the Ethereum network upgrade is completed.&nbsp;The timing and ultimate success of this upgrade is outside of Gemini\u2019s control.&nbsp;As a result, you will be unable to unstake and withdraw your ETH and any accumulated rewards during the intervening time.&nbsp;If you wish to retain the ability to transfer your ETH or are otherwise uncomfortable with this restriction, you should not instruct Gemini to stake your ETH.\nGemini makes no guarantees regarding the success of any upgrades to the Ethereum network.\nShould any such upgrade not be successful, you may lose a portion or all of your staked ETH.\nGemini will not be responsible for any ETH lost due to a network upgrade failure.FDIC InsuranceDigital Assets held in your Digital Asset account, including your Gemini Dollars, are not subject to deposit insurance protection, including but not limited to, FDIC insurance or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections.&nbsp;You may, however, be eligible to receive FDIC \u201cpass-through\u201d insurance for U.S.\ndollar cash deposits in your Fiat Account held in one or more Omnibus Accounts at one or more Banks located in the United States and for the portion of the Gemini Dollar Reserve represented by U.S.\ndollar cash deposits maintained in Gemini Dollar Omnibus Accounts.\nThe portion of U.S.\ndollar deposits that are held at FDIC-insured Banks are held at one of the following institutions: State Street Bank and Trust Company, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and Goldman Sachs.\nYour U.S.\ndollar deposits will be held solely in one of the following types of assets: (1) deposits at U.S.\nFDIC-insured Banks.\n(2) money-market funds, invested only in U.S.\nTreasury Obligations;&nbsp;and (3) U.S.\nTreasury Obligations.This FDIC \u201cpass-through\u201d insurance may be available in the event that the Bank holding such U.S.\ndollar cash deposits becomes subject to resolution or similar proceedings by the FDIC.\nSuch \u201cpass-through\u201d insurance is subject to the Standard Maximum Insurance Amount per FDIC regulations (currently $250,000 per eligible Gemini Customer) and other applicable limitations.\nOur policy is to comply, in good faith, with the regulations and other requirements of the FDIC for pass-through deposit insurance, including those contained in 12 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 330.\nFDIC pass-through insurance does not cover any losses resulting from any unauthorized access to your User Account.\nAs noted above, Gemini holds a portion of U.S.\ndollars that make up the Gemini Dollar Reserve in one or more Gemini Dollar Omnibus Accounts with the intention that they be eligible for FDIC \u201cpass-through\u201d deposit insurance.\nThis means that, if you are a Gemini customer and hold your Gemini Dollars in your Gemini Account, Gemini will maintain records showing your interest in the Gemini Dollar Omnibus Accounts for any portion of your U.S.\ndollars that is held&nbsp;in a Gemini Dollar Omnibus Accounts.\n&nbsp;Note the following with respect to FDIC \u201cpass-through\u201d insurance:<ul>\n<li>Gemini will maintain records of your ownership of U.S.\ndollar cash deposits in your Fiat Account held in one or more Omnibus Accounts and of Gemini Dollars and, accordingly, your interest in one or more Gemini Dollar Omnibus Accounts, in a manner reasonably designed to satisfy the FDIC\u2019s requirements for obtaining \u201cpass-through\u201d insurance.</li>\n<li>The ultimate availability of FDIC \"pass-through\" insurance and the actual amount of any such insurance may depend on other factors.\nThis includes your ability to verify your ownership of U.S.\ndollar cash deposits in your Fiat Account and of Gemini Dollars in your Gemini Account and the Standard Maximum Deposit Insurance Amount per FDIC regulations.\nThe Standard Maximum Deposit Insurance Amount is calculated by looking to the balance of all deposit accounts held in your name or held on your behalf at each FDIC-insured bank.\nAccordingly, if you hold other deposits at one of the Banks, this may limit the total amount of FDIC insurance available to you.</li>\n<li>The portion of your Fiat Account and the portion of the Gemini Dollar Reserve that are held in money market accounts or in investment accounts holding U.S.\nTreasury Obligations are not insured and you are not eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance for any portion of your Fiat Account or the Gemini Dollar Reserves held in such accounts.</li>\n<li>The availability of FDIC \u201cpass-through\u201d insurance depends on recordkeeping of the ultimate holder of Gemini Dollar and, as such, FDIC \u201cpass-through\u201d insurance may not be available if you are not a Gemini customer and/or do not hold your Gemini Dollars at Gemini.</li>\n</ul>\u200b\u200bPlease note: Non U.S.\ndollar deposits held at any Banks or financial institutions, as well as U.S dollar deposits held at Banks or financial institutions located outside of the United States, may not be subject to or eligible for FDIC deposit insurance.Certain circumstances may require us to transfer fiat currency between two or more of our Omnibus Accounts or terminate our relationship with one of our Banks.\nMovements of fiat currency between Omnibus Accounts are recorded in detail and will not affect the available balance in the Fiat Account of your Gemini Account.Notice for U.K.\nUsers: If your U.S.\ndollar deposits are held in an Omnibus Account at a Bank located in the United States, you are not entitled to lodge a complaint with the UK Financial Ombudsman Service (\u201cFOS\u201d) with respect to these U.S.\ndollar deposits, however, you may be entitled to lodge a complaint with the U.S.\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d).Privacy of InformationYou agree that the information contained in

considerations determined by us to be relevant in our sole discretion, and arrangements or terms offered to one Gemini Customer generally are not available to all, or even any, other Gemini Customers.\nExamples of factors we may consider in deciding whether to negotiate customized terms via a confidential side letter or similar agreement include, but are not limited to: (i) whether a Gemini Customer plans to or is expected to conduct a significant or high volume of trading activity on our Exchange, or (ii) whether a Gemini Customer is subject to specific and unique legal, tax, or

PROVISIONS.Dispute ResolutionYou and Gemini agree and understand that any controversy, claim, or dispute arising out of or relating to this User Agreement or your relationship with Gemini \u2014 past, present, or future \u2014 shall be settled solely and exclusively by binding arbitration held in the county in which you reside, or another mutually agreeable location, including remotely by way of video conference administered by National Arbitration and Mediation (\"NAM\") and conducted in English, rather than in court.\nYou and Gemini expressly agree that any dispute about the scope of this User Agreement to arbitrate and/or the arbitrability of any particular dispute shall be resolved in arbitration in accordance with this section.\nYou and Gemini expressly agree that an arbitrator may issue all appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief necessary to ensure the arbitration of disputes (but only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim).\nYou and Gemini agree to keep any arbitration strictly confidential.You and Gemini agree that this arbitration provision applies not just to disputes between you and Gemini but also to (a) disputes with Gemini and any other party named or added as a co-defendant along with Gemini at any time, and (b) disputes in which a party is named as a defendant involving claim(s) arising from or related to this User Agreement or any other Gemini agreement or program terms, even if Gemini is not named or added as a defendant.\nAny such co-defendant or defendant is a third-party beneficiary entitled to enforce this arbitration provision.You and Gemini agree that the arbitrator shall have the authority to order any remedies, legal or equitable, which a party could obtain from a court of competent jurisdiction in an individual case based on the claims asserted, and nothing more.\nThe arbitrator shall not award punitive or exemplary damages to either party, unless such remedies would otherwise be available under applicable law.You and Gemini agree that this arbitration provision evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\ns.\n1 et seq.\n(\u201cFAA\u201d), will govern its interpretation and enforcement and proceedings pursuant thereto.\nIt is the intent of the parties to be bound by the provisions of the FAA for all purposes, including, but not limited to, interpretation, implementation, enforcement, and administration of this arbitration provision, and the FAA shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by the law.You and Gemini agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, low-cost, and mutually beneficial outcome.\nTherefore, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cDispute Notice\u201d).\nAny Dispute Notice to Gemini must be sent to support@gemini.com (\u201cNotice Address\u201d).\nAny Dispute Notice to you by Gemini will be sent to the email address registered with your Gemini Account.\nAny Dispute Notice must include: (a) the name, address, and email address of the party providing the Dispute Notice.\n(b) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, including any relevant facts regarding Gemini or your use of Gemini.\n(c) an explanation of the specific relief sought, including the total damages sought, if any, and the basis for the damage calculations.\n(d) a signed statement from the party providing the Dispute Notice verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Dispute Notice.\nand (e) if the dispute is from you, and you have retained an attorney, a signed statement from you authorizing Gemini to disclose your account details to your attorney if necessary in resolving your claim or dispute.\nAny Dispute Notice from you must be individualized, meaning it can only concern your dispute and no other person\u2019s dispute.\nAnd any Dispute Notice from Gemini must be individualized, meaning it can only concern you and no other person.\nYou also agree that, after sending a Demand Notice to Gemini, at Gemini\u2019s request you will personally participate in a discussion by telephone with Gemini to discuss whether an agreement can be reached to resolve the claim before arbitration is initiated.\nIf you are represented by counsel, you agree that you will personally attend the telephone conference with your counsel.\nGemini also agrees to participate in such a telephone discussion at your request.\nAny informal dispute resolution conferences shall be individualized, such that a separate conference must be held each time either party intends to commence individual arbitration.\nmultiple individuals initiating claims cannot participate in the same informal telephonic dispute resolution conference, unless mutually agreed to by the parties.\nYou agree that compliance with these informal dispute resolution procedures is a condition precedent to commencing arbitration, and that the arbitrator shall dismiss any arbitration filed without fully and completely complying with these informal dispute resolution procedures.If you and Gemini do not reach an agreement to resolve a claim within 60 days after a Demand Notice is received, you or Gemini may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nexcept that, if either you or Gemini send the other an incomplete Dispute Notice, the 60-day period begins only after a complete Dispute Notice is received, and if either you or Gemini request a telephone discussion, the 60-day period begins only after the discussion has occurred.\nThe statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in these informal dispute resolution procedures.Should any dispute proceed to arbitration, you and Gemini agree that any such arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the prevailing NAM rules and procedures (including the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures&nbsp;and/or the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable) (\u201cNAM Rules\u201d), with the following exceptions to the NAM Rules if in conflict:<ul>\n<li>The arbitration shall be conducted by one neutral arbitrator;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Each side agrees to bear its own attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and expenses, unless such remedies would otherwise be available under applicable law, or unless the arbitrator finds that a claim, counterclaim, or defense is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).\nand</li>\n<li>All pleadings submitted in arbitration are subject to the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, which, among other things, permits sanctions to be imposed where pleadings are submitted for an improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The arbitrator may issue orders (including subpoenas to third parties, to the extent permitted by law) allowing the parties to conduct discovery sufficient to allow each party to prepare that party's claims and/or defenses, taking into consideration that arbitration is designed to be a speedy and efficient method for resolving disputes.\nFor example, the arbitrator shall apply the Apex Doctrine and preclude depositions of either party\u2019s current or former high-level officers absent a showing that the officer has unique, personal knowledge of discoverable information and less burdensome discovery methods have been exhausted.</li>\n</ul>Additionally, if, at any time, 25 or more similar demands for arbitration are asserted against either party or their related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities (\u201cMass Filing\u201d), the additional protocols set forth below shall apply:<ul>\n<li>NAM\u2019s Mass Filing Rules shall apply if the parties\u2019 dispute is deemed by NAM, in its sole discretion pursuant to the NAM Rules and this Dispute Resolution section, to be part of a Mass Filing.</li>\n<li>Any Mass Filing shall be subject to a bellwether proceeding intended to reach a fair and speedy resolution of all claims included in the Mass Filing.\nIn any Mass Filing, NAM shall select 15 demands for arbitration to proceed (\u201cBellwether Arbitrations\u201d).\nWhile the Bellwether Arbitrations are adjudicated, no other demand for arbitration that is part of the Mass Filings may be filed, processed, or adjudicated, and no filing fees for such a demand for arbitration shall be due from either party to the administrator.\nAny applicable statute of limitations regarding such a demand for arbitration shall remain tolled beginning when the Mass Filing claimant first provided the other party with its Dispute Notice, as defined above.</li>\n<li>Following the resolution of the Bellwether Arbitrations, the parties shall engage in a global mediation of all remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing.\nThe mediation shall be administered by NAM.\nIf the parties are unable to resolve the remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing within 30 days following the mediation, the remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing shall be administered by NAM on an individual basis pursuant to the NAM Rules.</li>\n</ul>You and Gemini agree to abide by all decisions and awards rendered in such proceedings and you and Gemini agree that such decisions and awards rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and conclusive, except for any appeal rights under the FAA.To the extent you or Gemini seek emergency relief in connection with any controversy, claim, or dispute arising out of or relating to this User Agreement or the breach thereof, or your relationship with Gemini, you and Gemini agree that this User Agreement restricts you or Gemini from seeking emergency relief from any court, including without limitation temporary restraining orders and/or preliminary injunctions, and you and Gemini agree that, to the extent either party breaches this User Agreement by seeking such relief from a court, that party shall be responsible for paying the opposing party\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees in opposing such relief, and the arbitrator shall render an award of such attorneys\u2019 fees at the earliest possible time after such fees are incurred.Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to settle disputes through arbitration, you or Gemini may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims (or an equivalent) court in New York County or any United States county where you live.\nHowever, if the claims are transferred, removed, or appealed to a different court, they shall be subject to arbitration.You and Gemini agree that you or Gemini may, without inconsistency with this arbitration provision, apply to any court for an order enforcing the arbitral award.\nYou and Gemini irrevocably and unconditionally agree to waive any objection that you or Gemini may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action or proceeding relating to enforcement of the arbitral award in the federal or state courts located in the State of New York.You and Gemini agree that all such controversies, claims, or disputes shall be settled in this manner in lieu of any action at law or equity.\nIn arbitration the parties waive their rights to have a jury trial.IF FOR ANY REASON THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE BECOMES NOT APPLICABLE OR FOR ANY OTHER REASON LITIGATION PROCEEDS IN COURT THEN THE PARTIES AGREE THAT YOU AND GEMINI:<ul>\n<li>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AS TO ANY ISSUE RELATING HERETO IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS USER AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICES THAT GEMINI PROVIDES OR ANY OTHER MATTER INVOLVING US HERETO, AND</li>\n<li>SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF THE FEDERAL OR STATE COURTS LOCATED IN NEW YORK COUNTY, NEW YORK AND YOU AGREE NOT TO INSTITUTE ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY OTHER COURT IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.</li>\n</ul>You and Gemini agree to arbitrate solely on an individual basis, and agree and understand that this User Agreement does not permit class action or private attorney general litigation or arbitration of any claims brought as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative arbitration proceeding or litigation (\u201cRepresentative and Class Action Waiver\u201d).\nThe arbitral or other tribunal may not consolidate more than one User\u2019s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nNothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit settlements on a class-wide or representative basis.&nbsp;If any portion of this arbitration clause is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions will nevertheless remain in force.\nIn any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class or representative action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Representative and Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the class and/or representative action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Representative and Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration.\nAdditionally, if a court determines that a public injunctive relief claim may proceed notwithstanding the Representative and Class Action Waiver, and that determination is not reversed on appeal, then the public injunctive relief claim will be decided by a court after any individual claims are arbitrated, and the parties will ask the court to stay the public injunctive relief claim until the other claims have been finally concluded in arbitration.EVEN IF YOU AND GEMINI HAVE ENTERED INTO ANY OTHER AGREEMENT, THESE DISPUTE RESOLUTION TERMS SHALL GOVERN THE RESOLUTION OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND GEMINI, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW.\nNOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING OR ANY OTHER PROVISION IN THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION CLAUSE OR THIS USER AGREEMENT, OTHER THAN DISPUTES ARISING SOLELY OUT OF OR RELATING SOLELY TO THE CREDIT CARD SERVICES, DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY GEMINI CREDIT CARD YOU MAY HAVE SHALL BE GOVERNED EXCLUSIVELY BY THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE IN THE GEMINI CREDIT CARD CARDHOLDER AGREEMENT, AND NOT BY THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE.You agree that this section of this User Agreement has been included to rapidly and inexpensively resolve any disputes with respect to the matters described herein, and that this section shall be grounds for stay or dismissal of any court action commenced by you with respect to a dispute arising out of such matters.A printed version of this User Agreement shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings.State License and Regulatory DisclosuresAlaskaAlaska Department of Commerce,

United States and other countries where we conduct business.\nThis includes, but is not limited to:<ul>\n<li>Establishing robust internal policies, procedures and controls that combat any attempted use of Gemini for illegal or illicit purposes and that are designed to ensure our customers basic protections under consumer protection laws;</li>\n<li>Complying with the applicable regulations and guidance set forth by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\u201cFinCEN\u201d);</li>\n<li>Filing Suspicious Activity Reports (\u201cSARs\u201d);</li>\n<li>Filing Currency Transaction Reports (\u201cCTRs\u201d);</li>\n<li>Maintaining comprehensive records of orders and other transfers;</li>\n<li>Employing a Chief Compliance Officer (\u201cCCO\u201d) to act as our Bank Secrecy Act Officer

and audits.TrainingAll of our employees and officers receive ongoing broad-based BSA/AML training, as well as position-specific training.\nThey must repeat this training at least once every twelve (12) months to ensure they are knowledgeable and in compliance with all pertinent laws and regulations.\nNew employees receive training within thirty (30) days of their start date.\nAll documentation related to compliance training including materials, tests, results, attendance and date are maintained.\nIn addition, our compliance training program is updated as necessary to reflect current laws and regulations.Compliance OfficerOur CCO is responsible for developing and enforcing the policies and procedures of our BSA/AML Program.\nOur CCO is required to report any violations of our BSA/AML Program directly to our CEO and our Board.\nIn addition, our CCO is responsible for recording and filing SARs, CTRs and performing a BSA/AML Program audit at least annually.Customer IdentificationOur

activities have occurred on Gemini.\nA suspicious transaction is often one that is inconsistent with a customer\u2019s known and legitimate business, personal activities or personal means.\nWe leverage our compliance department, which performs transaction monitoring to help identify unusual patterns of customer activity.\nOur CCO reviews and investigates suspicious activity to determine if sufficient information has been collected to justify the filing of a SAR.In addition, all currency transactions over a determined USD value are be reported to FinCEN via a CTR filing.Our CCO maintains records and supporting documentation of all SARs and CTRs that have been filed.Reporting RequirementsAll records are retained for seven (7) years and are readily available upon official request by an applicable examiner, regulator, or law enforcement agency.BSA/AML Program AuditInternalThe CCO is responsible for performing an audit of our BSA/AML Program at least annually, and presenting the
