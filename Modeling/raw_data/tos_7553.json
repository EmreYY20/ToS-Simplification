protection, we rely on this so-called adequacy decision by the EU Commission.</li>\n<li>If a recipient is not located in a country with an adequate level of data protection according to the EU Commission, we have concluded a special contract with this recipient in which we agree on rules to make sure the recipient takes adequate care of your personal data.\nThis contract is called the EU Standard Contractual Clauses and was developed by the EU Commission.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since we are located in New Zealand, any data that is transferred to us from our Subsidiary is transferred to a

How Long: How long do we keep the data? </p>\n1.\nCommunicating With You\n<p>\n<strong>a.\nWhat</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If we communicate with you via email, mail, or telephone, we process all personal data you disclose to us during our conversation (e.g., you name, email address, the reason why you are contacting us etc.).</p>\n<p>Apart from this, it is also possible that we use other online messaging systems to communicate with you, if you wish to contact us over these channels.\nPlease note that if you wish to contact us via such messaging systems, it is possible that the respective companies that offer these communication services may also process your personal data and that regarding this their privacy policies apply.\nWe have no influence over such data processing by third parties.\nFor further information on how these services process your personal data, please view their privacy policies.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>b.\nWho</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Recipients of the processed

Sect.II.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>c.\nWhy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Depending on the specific conversation with you, the personal data can either be processed in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with us or to perform a contract you have concluded with us.\nAlso, the processing can be necessary for us to comply with legal documentation obligations.\nAlso, the processing can be necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interest to respond to mails and calls of yours when you contact us and are not our contractual partner as well as to have proof regarding substantial content of our conversation, including but not limited to cases of potential legal claims on our or your side.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>d.\nLegal Basis</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The legal

UK GDPR.\nThe legal basis for processing the data for compliance with our legal obligations is Art.\n6 para.\n1 let.\nc) UK GDPR.\nThe legal basis for processing the data due to our legitimate interest is Art.\n6 para.\n1 let.\nf) UK GDPR.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>e.\nHow long</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The data is stored at least for the time until our contract with you is fully performed.\nIf the data

origin, if applicable, also the website from where you were referred to our website.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>b.\nWho</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Recipients of the processed personal data are the respective internal employees and freelancers of ours that are responsible for pursuing our purposes for the processing.\nPossible further recipients: IT service providers and host providers, especially Amazon Web Services and CloudFlare.</p>\n<p>Depending on the specific case, it is possible that our Subsidiary jointly processes personal data with us according to Sect.\nII.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>c.\nWhy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We process this data to display the website correctly in your browser, so you are able to make use of the full functionality of the services and

subject to malicious use and to be able to effectively respond to any potential bugs or other malfunctions of the website.</p>\n<p>If the data is also processed for another purpose set out in this Privacy Policy, the storage period regarding that purpose applies as well.</p>\n3.\nNinja Kiwi Website Registration\n<p>\n<strong>a.\nWhat</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Registration for ninjakiwi.com is exclusively for the website and does not apply to mobile games or forums, which are separate registrations.\nRegistration asks for username, email, and password or for 3rd party login via Facebook or Google.\nPlayers under the age of 16 in the EU or under the age of 13 in all other territories are directed specifically to use parent or guardian emails.\n</p>\n<p>Your Ninja Kiwi Website profile will have multiple stats stored on our servers which are based on your web game performance and actions.\nFor example, profile level, coins earnt, clan chosen, etc.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>b.\nWho</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Recipients of the processed personal data are the respective employees and freelancers of ours that are responsible for processing the data.\nPossible further recipients: IT service providers and host providers.</p>\n<p>Depending on the specific case, it is possible that our Subsidiary jointly processes personal data with us according to Sect.\nII.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>c.\nWhy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>While you do not need to register to play many of the games on ninjakiwi.com, several games or game features will not work without a successfully registered account, since they are online multiplayer or online coop games with the key feature of playing with or against other players.\nAlso, we cannot provide effective customer support for game progress in such games without a successfully registered account.</p>\n<p>We might email all registered players in the case of legal notices or major company news.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>d.\nLegal Basis</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The legal basis for processing the data is to enter into or perform a contract we concluded with you is Art.\n6 para.\n1 let.\nb) UK

automatically after 6 years of inactivity.\nIf possible, we will notify you one week before we delete your inactive account to give you the possibility to keep your account if you wish.</p>\n<p>If the data is also processed for another purpose set out in this Privacy Policy, the storage period regarding that purpose applies as well.</p>\n4.\nNinja Kiwi Account Registration\n<p>\n<strong>a.\nWhat</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you register for a Ninja Kiwi account, this account can be used across most Ninja Kiwi games but does not provide registration to ninjakiwi.com or forums.\nYou may provide us with an email that we use as a unique identifier for your account or choose a 3rd party login like Facebook, Apple, Google, Steam, Twitch, or Gamecenter.</p>\n<p>If you are under the age of 16 in the European Union or under the age of 13 in all other territories, you are allowed to register for Ninja Kiwi accounts, but you cannot supply any personally identifiable information (e.g., no email address or name) and are instead generated: A random non-editable player name,\na randomly assigned unique long and short code, and\na randomly assigned unique recovery code.\n</p>\n<p>For games with social guilds such as Clans, , parties, or teams, you must identify your age before you join a Clan, party, or team in these games, and you are then excluded from sending, receiving, or reading any chat messages - chat is completely disabled.\nInstead of simply excluding underage players from the game or from participating in social guilds, we choose this approach as it allows underage players to participate in the fun of social guild play and be part of a team, but without risking personal data sharing.\n</p>\n<p>If you are 16 and over in the EU and 13 and over elsewhere, you can use the chat functionality.\nFor this functionality we process the information you enter into the chat.</p>\n<p>Please note that for some games, your leaderboard scores and player name may be publicly available to other players.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>b.\nWho</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Recipients of the processed personal data are the respective employees and freelancers of ours that are responsible for processing the data.\nPossible further recipients: IT service providers and host providers.</p>\n<p>Depending on the specific case, it is possible that our Subsidiary jointly processes personal data with us according to Sect.\nII.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>c.\nWhy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The registration data is required so you can play the game as intended to allow you to contact support@ninjakiwi.com from that email, so that customer support can immediately validate the account ownership and offer assistance more quickly.</p>\n<p>If you are considered a minor, the randomly assigned nickname is required to identify you as a player for other players in the game, the short and long randomly assigned unique codes are required so we can make the game work and the randomly assigned recovery code can be used by you to get support from us.</p>\n<p>We might email all registered players in the case of legal notices or major company news, provided we have their email address.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>d.\nLegal Basis</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The legal basis for processing the data to enter into or perform a contract we concluded with you is Art.\n6 para.\n1 let.\nb) UK
