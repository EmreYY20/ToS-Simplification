the details at the end of this Policy.</p>1.\nGENERAL<p>1.1.\n<strong>Introduction</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our aim for WeChat is that it will always make a positive impact on our users' lives, and that it will be a platform that benefits its users.</p>\n<p>We are constantly looking to improve and innovate WeChat.\nPart of achieving this goal is ensuring that users can continue to use WeChat safely and that WeChat is used in an acceptable manner by all users.\nThis Policy sets out rules to ensure good behaviour in the use of WeChat by users.\nYou may also refer to the WeChat Community Guidelines which further explains the types of content and behaviour that are or are not allowed on WeChat.</p>\n<p>We are guided by continuous feedback from users and industry experts in developing this Policy, and we strive to ensure that this Policy is inclusive of diverse ideas, views and information.\nWe are always open to receiving feedback from our users \u2013 if you wish to do so, please contact us using the details at the end of this Policy.</p>\n<p>1.2.\n<strong>Enforcement and breach (or potential breach) of this Policy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Where you have (or we reasonably believe you have)

will aim to apply this Policy consistently across all jurisdictions, in some jurisdictions there may be specific requirements under applicable laws which necessitate differing applications of parts of this Policy.\nIn addition, the laws applicable to WeChat are constantly evolving, so please remain alert to changes of laws and rules applicable to users in other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>If you wish to report another user who may have potentially breached this policy, please refer to Section 12 of this Policy for our contact details.</p>\n<p>1.3.\n<strong>How do we apply this

regulations, Weixin may at its discretion restrict or limit the interoperability of Weixin with WeChat, including restricting or limiting Weixin users from interacting with WeChat
