collaborators, and usage activity.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Usage information.</i> We collect information related to how you use the Services, including actions you take in your account (like sharing, editing, viewing, creating and moving files or folders).\nWe use this information to provide, improve, and promote our Services, and protect UpBox.me users.\nPlease refer to our FAQ for more information about

location information to the Services.\nFor example, we use device information to detect abuse and identify and troubleshoot bugs.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Cookies and other technologies.</i> We use technologies
