determine that it is necessary to satisfy the compliance obligations of an Organisation with which you have agreed to share your verified information through Certsy.</li>\n<li>SEEK PartnersWe may

with the Organisation directly rather than Certsy.\nThe Organisation may not be able to delete your information for compliance reasons.\nWhile we expressly require that Organisations comply with all applicable laws (including privacy laws and laws governing health information), we are unable to control how Organisations use your information.</li>\n</ul>Certsy may also disclose the information it
