submitting the order the buyer agrees to these conditions.</p>\n2.\nMediation activities of Coinsbee.com\n<p>Coinsbee.com presents a variety of regional and global voucher cards from multiple vendors.\nThe service of Coinsbee.com consists in the mediation of the respective gift card.\nCoinsbee.com is the intermediary between you and the respective gift card provider.\nCoinsbee.com therefore has no influence on the conditions for the use and implementation of the gift card at the respective provider.\nFor the legal relationship between you and the voucher card provider, only the terms and conditions of the respective voucher card provider apply.</p>\n3.\nPurchase Order / Order\n<p>With the purchase the buyer has to give the respective necessary data (email address), which concerns his person correctly.\nAfter submitting the form, the buyer will be redirected to the website by the payment provider.\nUpon successful confirmation of payment, a confirmation page will be

delivered to the buyer at the specified email address.</p>\n4.\nManipulation\n<p>Any kind of manipulation of the website, databases, scripts and servers is prohibited.\nThe operator reserves the right, depending on the seriousness of the manipulation, to initiate legal action and to block the respective account.</p>\n5.\nAvailability\n<p>The operator is entitled to change these terms at any time without prior notice.\nFurthermore, the operator is at any time entitled to exclude individual users from the service without stating reasons.</p>\n6.\nChanges to the terms and conditions\n<p>The operator is entitled to change these terms at any time without prior notice.\nThe changes will be posted on the page.</p>\n7.\nPrivacy\n<p>Our privacy policy applies.</p>\n8.\nCancellation\n<p>With

executed.</p>\n9.\nKnow your Customer (KYC) - Limitations of use\n<p>In accordance with current anti-financial crime and money laundering laws, we comply with legal requirements by conducting a KYC (Know Your Customer) check when certain limits are reached.<br>\nAll data is stored in encrypted form and not passed on to third parties.\nThe verification is realized via our certified partner Veriff.</p>\n<p>Limit without verification: max.\n\u20ac1,000 per order, max.\n\u20ac10,000 in total<br>\nLimit with verification: no limit<br>\nMiscellaneous: Some products can generally only be purchased from verified accounts.<br>\n<br>\nEntering incorrect data or documents can lead to a blocking of subsequent purchases.\nIt can also lead to the purchase not being processed.</p>\n10.\nAnti Money Laundering (AML)\n<p>Money laundering (ML) and terrorist financing (TF) are very big challenges for the crypto community.\nFor Coinsbee GmbH, ML and TF pose a serious threat to their activities.\nThat is why Coinsbee GmbH introduces and implements guidelines for combating money laundering (AML) and terrorist financing (CTF) in accordance with the relevant legal acts, recommendations, guidelines and best practices.<br>\nThe most important elements of the AML and CTF guidelines of Coinsbee GmbH are listed below:<br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Customer due diligence</b>\n<br>\nCustomer due diligence information is obtained from the customer prior to entering into business relationships (and subject to KYC rules).\nCoinsbee GmbH also compares the information with independent sources for correctness.\nBy collecting and verifying the customer\u2019s information the Company aims to form a reasonable belief as to the true identity of the customer.\nCoinsbee GmbH must also understand the business of the customer to make sure that the customer does not launder illicit funds through Coinsbee GmbH and/or these funds will not be used for TF.<br>\nInformation and documents made available to Coinsbee GmbH when identifying the customer are processed in accordance with the data protection regulations of Coinsbee GmbH.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Risk Assessment</b>\n<br>\nA risk-based approach is used for the risk assessment.\nThis means that Coinsbee GmbH understands the ML and TF risks to which it is exposed and applies AML / CFT measures in a manner and to an extent that ensures a mitigation of these risks.\nThis flexibility enables Coinsbee GmbH to make the best possible use of its resources in situations with higher risks and to take increased measures.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Ongoing Monitoring</b>\n<br>\nCoinsbee GmbH continuously monitors business relationships with customers.\nAll business relationships are continuously monitored using the risk-based approach, regardless of their risk classification.\nHowever, the scope and type of monitoring depends on the risk level of the customer and the respective service provided.\nOngoing monitoring enables Coinsbee GmbH to gain deeper insights into the profiles and behavior of customers.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Record Keeping</b>\n<br>\nCoinsbee GmbH keeps records for each customer as part of the fight against ML and TF.\nThese are encrypted in accordance with applicable law.\nThis is to enable effective investigations, prosecutions and confiscation of criminal property to be as simple as possible.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Communication with the responsible authorities and provision of information</b>\n<br>\nCommunication with the responsible authorities and provision of information in the event of inquiries from authorities within the framework of applicable law.\nIf there is suspicion or knowledge that the property of any value comes directly or indirectly from criminal activities or participation in such activities or that the intended purpose of the property is to sponsor one or more terrorists or a terrorist organization, Coinsbee GmbH will do so report to the competent authority and will cooperate on follow-up actions.\nThis goes so far that the authorities (as far as legally permissible) all data of the customer and customer-specific records are made available.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n11.\nMeasures to fight terrorism\n<p>With comparison of customer data with sanction lists (OFAC) Coinsbee GmbH follows its legal obligations.\nThe measures support the long-term goal of combating global terrorism activities.\nIn addition to EU sanctions lists, US sanctions lists are also important for Coinsbee GmbH.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Honey for your crypto

to the online merchant.</p>\n<p>The personal data exchanged with Sofort\u00fcberweisung are first name, surname, address, email address, IP address, telephone number, mobile phone number or other data necessary for the payment processing.\nThe purpose of the transfer of data is to process payments and prevent fraud.\nThe data controller will transmit other personal data by immediate transfer even if there is a legitimate interest in the transmission.\nThe personal data exchanged between Sofort\u00fcberweisung and the controller may be transmitted by Sofort\u00fcberweisung to credit reference agencies.\nThe purpose of this transfer is to check identity and creditworthiness.</p>\n<p>Sofort\u00fcberweisung may pass on the personal data to affiliated companies and service providers or subcontractors if this is necessary to fulfil the contractual obligations or if the data are to be processed by order.</p>\n<p>The person concerned has the possibility to revoke his or her consent to the handling of personal data at any time compared to Sofort\u00fcberweisung.\nRevocation does not affect personal data that must be processed, used or transmitted for (contractual) payment

for Coingate as a payment method\n<p>The data controller has integrated Coingate components on this website.\nCoingate is a payment service that enables cashless payment for products and services on the Internet.</p>\n<p>The operating company of Coingate is UAB \"Virtualios valiutos\", A.\nGostauto str.\n8-331, LT-01108, Vilnius, Lithuania.\n</p>\n<p>If the person concerned selects \"Coingate\" as a payment option during the ordering process in our online shop, data on the person concerned will be automatically transmitted to Coingate.\nBy selecting this payment option, the person concerned consents to the transfer of personal data required for the processing of the payment.</p>.\n<p>Coingate's current data protection regulations can be found at https://coingate.com/privacy.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n6.\nRegistration on our website\n<p>The data subject shall have the possibility to register on the Internet site of the controller by providing personal data.\nThe personal data transmitted to the data controller is specified in the respective input mask used for registration.\nThe personal data entered by the data subject are collected and stored solely for internal use by the data controller and for his own purposes.\nThe data controller may arrange for the transfer to one or more processors, such as a parcel service provider, who shall also use the personal data exclusively for internal use attributable to the controller.</p>\n<p>By registering on the Internet site of the data controller, the IP address assigned to the data subject by the Internet service provider (ISP), the date and time of registration are also stored.\nThe storage of this data is done against the background that only in this way can the misuse of our services be prevented and, if necessary, these data make it possible to clarify criminal offences that have been committed.\nTo this extent, the storage of this data is necessary to protect the person responsible for processing.\nAs a matter of principle, this data will not be passed on to third parties, unless there is a legal obligation to do so or the passing on of the data serves criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p>The registration of the data subject, with the voluntary provision of personal data, enables the controller to offer the data subject content or services which, by their very nature, can only be provided to registered users.\nRegistered persons are free to modify the personal data provided during registration at any time or to have them completely deleted from the data stock of the data controller.</p>\n<p>The controller shall provide any data subject with information on what personal data relating to the data subject are stored at any time on request.\nFurthermore, the data controller shall correct or delete personal data at the request or notification of the data subject, unless otherwise required by law.\nThe entire staff of the data controller is available to the data subject as contact persons in this context.</p> 7.\nSubscribe to our Newsletters\n<p>On the Coinsbee GmbH website, users are given the opportunity to subscribe to our company's newsletter.\nWhich personal data will be transmitted to the data controller when ordering the newsletter can be seen from the input mask used for this purpose.</p>\n<p>Coinsbee GmbH informs its customers and business partners at regular intervals by means of a newsletter about offers of the company.\nThe newsletter of our company can only be received by the person concerned if (1) the person concerned has a valid e-mail address and (2) the person concerned registers for the newsletter.\nFor legal reasons, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address registered for the first time by a person concerned for the purpose of receiving the newsletter using the double opt-in procedure.\nThis confirmation mail is used to check whether the owner of the e-mail address has authorized the receipt of the newsletter as the person concerned.</p>\n<p>When registering for the newsletter, we also save the IP address assigned by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) of the computer system used by the person concerned at the time of registration, as well as the date and time of registration.\nThe collection of this data is necessary in order to be able to trace the (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data subject at a later point in time and therefore serves to provide legal protection for the person responsible for processing.</p>\n<p>The personal data collected during registration for the newsletter will be used exclusively for sending our newsletter.\nIn addition, subscribers to the newsletter could be informed by e-mail if this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or for registration, as could be the case if there are changes to the newsletter offer or if technical conditions change.\nThe personal data collected within the scope of the newsletter service will not be passed on to third parties.\nThe subscription to our newsletter can be cancelled by the person concerned at any time.\nThe consent to the storage of personal data, which the person concerned has given us for the newsletter service, can be revoked at any time.\nFor the purpose of revoking the consent, a corresponding link is included in every newsletter.\nFurthermore, it is also possible to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time directly on the website of the data controller or to inform the data controller in another way.</p> 8.\nNewsletter-Tracking\n<p>The newsletters of Coinsbee GmbH contain so-called counting pixels.\nA tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in such e-mails sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and log file analysis.\nThis enables a statistical evaluation of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns.\nBy means of the embedded pixel-code, Coinsbee GmbH can recognise whether and when an e-mail was opened by a person concerned and which links in the e-mail were called up by the person concerned.</p>\n<p>Such personal data collected via the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored and evaluated by the data controller in order to optimise the newsletter dispatch and to adapt the content of future newsletters even better to the interests of the data subject.\nThis personal data is not passed on to third parties.\nAffected persons are entitled to revoke the separate declaration of consent submitted in this regard via the double opt-in procedure at any time.\nAfter revocation, these personal data will be deleted by the data controller.\nCoinsbee GmbH automatically interprets a cancellation of the receipt of the newsletter as a revocation.</p> 9.\nRoutine deletion and blocking of personal data\n<p>The data controller shall process and store personal data relating to the data subject only for the time necessary to achieve the purpose for which the data are stored or where provided for by the European Directives and Regulations or by any other law or regulation to which the controller is subject.</p>\n<p>If the purpose of storage ceases to apply or if a storage period prescribed by the European Directive and Regulation Giver or any other competent legislator expires, the personal data will be blocked or deleted as a matter of routine and in accordance with the statutory provisions.</p> 10.\nRights of the data subject\n<ul>\n<li>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nRight to confirmation\n<p>Every data subject has the right, granted by the European Directives and Regulations, to obtain confirmation from the controller as to whether personal data relating to him are being processed.\nIf a data subject wishes to exercise this right of confirmation, he or she may at any time contact an employee of the controller.</p>\n</li>\n<li>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nRight to information\n<p>Any person affected by the processing of personal data has the right, granted by the European Directives and Regulations, to obtain at any time and free of charge from the controller information on the personal data stored in relation to him or her and a copy thereof.\nFurthermore, the European Directive and Regulation Giver has granted the data subject access to the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> the processing purposes</li>\n<li> the categories of personal data processed</li>\n<li>the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular to recipients in third countries or

processing</li>\n<li>the existence of a right of appeal to a supervisory authority</li>\n<li>if the personal data are not collected from the data subject: All available information on the origin of the data</li>\n<li>the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, in accordance with Article 22(1) and (4) of the DS-GVO and, at least in these cases, meaningful information on the logic involved and the scope and intended impact of such processing on the data subject</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The data subject shall also have the right to obtain information as to whether personal data have been transferred to a third country or to an international organisation.\nIf this is the case, the data subject shall also have the right to obtain information on the appropriate safeguards in relation to the transfer.</p>\n<p>If a data subject wishes to exercise this right of access, he or she may at any time contact an employee of the controller.</p>\n</li>\n<li>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nRight of rectification\n<p>Every person concerned by the processing of personal data has the right, granted by the European legislator, to request the rectification without delay of inaccurate personal data concerning him.\nThe data subject shall also have the right to request the completion of incomplete personal data, including by means of a supplementary declaration, having regard to the purposes of the processing.</p>\n<p>If a data subject wishes to exercise this right of rectification, he or she may at any time contact an employee of the controller.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nd)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nRight of cancellation (right to be forgotten)\n<p>Any person affected by the processing of personal data has the right, granted by the European Directives and Regulations, to obtain from the controller the immediate erasure of personal data relating to him/her, where one of the following reasons applies and where the processing is not necessary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The personal data has been collected or otherwise processed for purposes for which it is no longer necessary.</li>\n<li>The data subject withdraws the consent on which the processing was based pursuant to Article 6(1)(a) of the DS-GVO or Article 9(2)(a) of the DS-GVO, and there is no other legal basis for the processing.</li>\n<li>The data subject lodges an objection to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the DS-GVO and there are no legitimate legitimate grounds for processing, or the data subject lodges an objection to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the DS-GVO.</li>\n<li>The personal data were processed unlawfully.</li>\n<li>The deletion of personal data is necessary to comply with a legal obligation under Union law or the law of the Member States to which the controller is subject.</li>\n<li>The personal data was collected in relation to the information society services offered in accordance with Art.\n8 Paragraph 1 of the DS-GVO.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If one of the above reasons applies and a data subject wishes to have personal data stored by Coinsbee GmbH deleted, he or she may contact an employee of the data controller at any time.\nThe employee of Coinsbee GmbH will ensure that the request for deletion is complied with immediately.</p>\n<p>If the personal data have been made public by Coinsbee GmbH and our company as the responsible party is obliged to delete the personal data in accordance with Art.\n17 para.\n1 of the DS-GVO, Coinsbee GmbH will take reasonable measures, including technical measures, taking into account the available technology and the implementation costs, to inform other data controllers who process the published personal data that the data subject has requested that these other data controllers delete all links to this personal data or copies or replications of this personal data, unless the processing is necessary.\nThe employee of Coinsbee GmbH will make the necessary arrangements in individual cases.</p>\n</li>\n<li>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nRight to limit processing\n<p>Any person affected by the processing of personal data has the right granted by the European Directives and Regulations to request the controller to restrict the processing if one of the following conditions is met:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period of time that allows the data controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data.</li>\n<li>The processing is unlawful, the data subject refuses to have his personal data deleted and instead requests that the use of his personal data be restricted.</li>\n<li>The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but the data subject needs them in order to exercise or defend his rights.</li>\n<li>The data subject has lodged an objection to the processing in accordance with Article 21 (1) of the DS-GVO and it is not yet clear whether the legitimate reasons of the controller outweigh those of the data subject.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If one of the above-mentioned conditions is met and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of personal data stored by Coinsbee GmbH, he/she may contact an employee of the data controller at any time.\nThe employee of Coinsbee GmbH will arrange for the restriction of the processing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nRight to data transferability\n<p>Every person concerned by the processing of personal data has the right, granted by the European Directives and Regulations, to receive the personal data concerning him/her which have been provided by the data subject to a controller in a structured, common and machine-readable format.\nHe/she also has the right to have this data communicated to another controller without hindrance by the controller to whom the personal data has been made available, provided that the processing is based on the consent pursuant to Art.\n6(1)(a) DS-GVO or Art.\n9(2)(a) DS-GVO or on a contract pursuant to Art.\n6(1)(b) DS-GVO and that the processing is carried out by means of automated procedures, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, when exercising his or her right to data transfer in accordance with Art.\n20 Paragraph 1 of the DS-GVO, the data subject has the right to request that personal data be transferred directly from one person responsible to another, insofar as this is technically feasible and provided that this does not affect the rights and freedoms of other persons.</p>\n<p>To assert the right to data transferability, the person concerned can contact an employee of Coinsbee GmbH at any time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\ng)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nRight of appeal\n<p>Every person concerned by the processing of personal data has the right, granted by the European legislator, to object at any time, for reasons arising from his or her particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning him or her carried out pursuant to Article 6(1)(e) or (f) of the DS-GVO.\nThis also applies to profiling based on these provisions.</p>\n<p>Coinsbee GmbH will no longer process the personal data in the event of an objection, unless we can prove compelling reasons for processing that are worthy of protection and outweigh the interests, rights and freedoms of the person concerned, or the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.</p>\n<p>If Coinsbee GmbH processes personal data for the purpose of direct marketing, the data subject has the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data for the purpose of such marketing.\nThis also applies to profiling, insofar as it is connected with such direct marketing.\nIf the data subject objects to Coinsbee GmbH processing for the purposes of direct marketing, Coinsbee GmbH will no longer process the personal data for these purposes.</p>\n<p>In addition, the data subject has the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning him or her carried out at Coinsbee GmbH for the purposes of scientific or historical research or for statistical purposes, in accordance with Article 89, paragraph 1 of the DS-GVO, unless such processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.</p>\n<p>To exercise the right of objection, the person concerned may directly contact any employee of Coinsbee GmbH or any other employee.\nThe data subject is also free to exercise his/her right of objection in connection with the use of information society services, notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, by means of automated procedures involving technical specifications.</p>\n</li>\n<li>h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nAutomated decisions in individual cases including profiling\n<p>Every person concerned by the processing of personal data has the right, as granted by the European Directives and Regulations, not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or significantly affects him or her in a similar way, provided that the decision (1) is not necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between the data subject and the controller, or (2) is authorised by Union or national legislation to which the controller is subject and that such legislation provides for adequate safeguards of the rights and freedoms and legitimate interests of the data subject, or (3) is taken with the explicit consent of the data subject.</p>\n<p>Where the decision is (1) necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between the data subject and the controller or (2) with the explicit consent of the data subject, Coinsbee GmbH shall take reasonable steps to safeguard the rights and freedoms and legitimate interests of the data subject, which shall include at least the right to obtain the intervention of a person from the controller, to put forward his point of view and to challenge the decision.</p>\n<p>If the data subject wishes to exercise rights relating to automated decisions, he or she may at any time contact an employee of the controller.</p>\n</li>\n<li>i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nRight to revoke a data protection consent\n<p>Every person affected by the processing of personal data has the right granted by the European Directives and Regulations to revoke his or her consent to the processing of personal data at any time.</p>\n<p>If the data subject wishes to exercise his or her right to withdraw consent, he or she may at any time contact an employee of the controller.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> 11.\nLegal basis of the processing\n<p>Art.\n6 I lit.\na DS-GVO serves our company as a legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose.\nIf the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, as is the case, for example, with processing operations necessary for the supply of goods or the provision of another service or consideration, the processing is based on Art.\n6 I lit.\nb DS-GVO.\nThe same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, for example in cases of enquiries about our products or services.\nIf our company is subject to a legal obligation which makes it necessary to process personal data, for example to fulfil tax obligations, the processing is based on Art.\n6 I lit.\nc DS-GVO.\nIn rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person.\nThis would be the case, for example, if a visitor to our company was injured and his or her name, age, health insurance details or other vital information had to be disclosed to a doctor, hospital or other third party.\nThe processing would then be based on Art.\n6 I lit.\nd DS-GVO.\nFinally, processing operations could be based on Art.\n6 I lit.\nf DS-GVO.\nProcessing operations which are not covered by any of the above legal bases are based on this legal basis if the processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or of a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not prevail.\nWe are permitted to carry out such processing operations in particular because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator.\nIn this respect, it took the view that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a customer of the controller (Recital 47 sentence 2 DS-GVO).\n</p> 12.\nlegitimate interests in the processing pursued by the controller or a third party\n<p>If the processing of personal data is based on Article 6 I lit.\nf of the DS-GVO, our legitimate interest is to carry out our business activities for the benefit of the well-being of all our employees and our shareholders.</p> 13th period for which the personal data are stored\n<p>The criterion for the duration of the storage of personal data is the respective legal retention period.\nAfter expiry of the period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, provided that it is no longer required for the fulfilment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.</p> 14.\nlegal or contractual provisions making the personal data available.\nnecessity for the conclusion of the contract.\nobligation of the data subject to provide the personal data.\npossible consequences of not providing the data\n<p>We would like to inform you that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g.\ntax regulations) or can also result from contractual regulations (e.g.\ninformation on the contractual partner).\nSometimes it may be necessary for a contract to be concluded that a person concerned provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us.\nFor example, the person concerned is obliged to provide us with personal data if our company concludes a contract with him/her.\nFailure to provide the personal data would mean that the contract with the person concerned could not be concluded.\nBefore the person concerned makes personal data available, he or she must contact one of our employees.\nOur employee will inform the data subject on a case-by-case basis whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and what the consequences would be if the personal data were not provided.\n</p> 15.\nexistence of automated decision making\n<p>As a responsible company we do not use automatic decision making or profiling.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Honey for your crypto money</p> Help <ul>\n<li>Gift Card Designer</li>\n<li>Supported Cryptocurrencies</li>\n<li>How it works</li>\n<li>FAQ / Support</li>\n</ul> Legal
