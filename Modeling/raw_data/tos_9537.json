Processing</strong>.\n&nbsp;To the extent Data falls within the scope of the General Data Protection Regulation or the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation, the terms of the Data Processing Attachment in <strong>Appendix 1</strong> of these Terms (\u201c<strong>DPA</strong>\u201d) apply to the processing of any Customer Personal Data (as defined in the DPA).\nTo the extent

(\u201c<strong>U.S.\nState DPA</strong>\u201d) apply to the processing of any Personal Data (as defined in the U.S.\nState DPA).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>18.3 Data</strong>.\nAs between you and Otter.ai,

Generally</strong>.\nIn the interest of resolving disputes between you and Otter.ai in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section 19.2 and 19.3, you and Otter.ai agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration.\nArbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\nThis agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms.\nYOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND OTTER.AI ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19.2 Exceptions</strong>.\nDespite the provisions of Section 19.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court.\n(b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available.\n(c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration.\nor (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19.3 Opt-Out</strong>.\nIf you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 19 within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to Otter.ai, Inc., Attention: Legal Department -Arbitration Opt-Out, 800 W El Camino Real, Suite 170, Mountain View, CA 94040 that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (\u201c<strong>Opt-Out Notice</strong>\u201d).\nOnce Otter.ai receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 19 will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 20.2.\nThe remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19.4 Arbitrator</strong>.\nAny arbitration between you and Otter.ai will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201c<strong>AAA</strong>\u201d) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, \u201c<strong>AAA Rules</strong>\u201d) as modified by these Terms.\nThe AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Otter.ai.\nThe arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19.5 Notice of Arbitration.\nProcess</strong>.\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S.\nMail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (\u201c<strong>Notice of Arbitration</strong>\u201d).\nOtter.ai\u2019s address for Notice is: Otter.ai, Inc., 800 W El Camino Real, Suite 170, Mountain View, CA 94040.\nThe Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\u201c<strong>Demand</strong>\u201d).\nThe parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Otter.ai may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nAll arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Otter.ai must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIf the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Otter.ai in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, Otter.ai will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator.\nor (ii) $10,000.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19.6 Fees</strong>.\nIf you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Otter.ai will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.\nAny arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Santa Clara County, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing.\nor (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.\nIf the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\nIn that case, you agree to reimburse Otter.ai for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19.7 No Class Actions</strong>.\nYOU AND OTTER.AI AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nFurther, unless both you and Otter.ai agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19.8 Modifications to this Arbitration Provision</strong>.\nIf Otter.ai makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Otter.ai\u2019s address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Otter.ai\u2019s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Otter.ai will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19.9 Enforceability</strong>.\nIf Section 19.7 or the entirety of this Section 19 is found to be unenforceable, or if Otter.ai receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 19 will be null and void and, in that case, exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 20.2 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>20.\nMiscellaneous</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>20.1 General Terms</strong>.\nThese Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Otter.ai regarding your use of the Service.\nYou may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent.\nWe may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent.\nThe failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.\nUse of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision.\nThroughout these Terms the use of the word \u201cincluding\u201d means \u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d.\nIf any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>20.2 Governing Law</strong>.\nThese Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles.\nYou and
