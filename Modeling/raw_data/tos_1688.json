Agreement found at https://www.netlify.com/legal/terms-of-use/, govern use of Netlify\u2019s software, solutions and services (\u201cServices\u201d) to build, deploy and manage modern web projects.</p>\n<p>By clicking on the \u201cCreate Account\u201d button (or any similar button) that is presented to you (\u201cCustomer\u201d) at the time of sign-up or by using or accessing the Services, you indicate that you agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Terms of Use Agreement.</p>\n<p>You will be referred to in this Agreement as either \u201cyou\u201d or \u201cCustomer.\u201d If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company, organization or another legal entity, you are agreeing to this Agreement for that entity and representing that you have the authority to bind such entity to this Agreement, in which case the terms \u201cCustomer\u201d or \u201cyou\u201d will refer to such entity.\nIf you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with this Agreement, you must not accept this Agreement and must not use the Service.</p>\n<p>Some software available through the Services may contain open source or third party software, which may have additional terms and restrictions regarding such software\u2019s use.</p>\n<p>In appropriate cases, Netlify will enter into a written Enterprise Subscription Agreement with the Customer which will govern instead of this Agreement.</p>1.\nEmail Account<p>A valid Netlify account may only be created and maintained by a Customer who provides valid information about the Customer in the signup process.\nTo maintain a valid account, the Customer must regularly update such information to assure its accuracy.\nNetlify reserves the right to terminate any account that does not include a valid email address on file.</p>\n<p>Please be aware, however, that if the domain of the email address associated with your account is owned or controlled by an entity and Netlify has now or in the future a direct subscription agreement with such entity, your account may be rolled into and consolidated with that organization\u2019s account after notification to you.\nFollowing notice to you, if you choose not to change the email address associated with your account, your account will be controlled by the entity.</p>2.\nAccess to Services<p>Customer is hereby granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable right to access and use the Services, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\nIf Customer is an entity, Customer\u2019s Affiliates may also access and use the Services provided that such Affiliates complies with the terms of this Agreement, and Customer remains responsible for such Affiliates\u2019 acts and omissions in connection with this Agreement as if Customer had performed such acts and omissions itself.\n\u201cAffiliate\u201d means an entity which, directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a party, where \u201ccontrol\u201d means the power to direct the management or affairs of an entity, for example through the beneficial ownership of more than 50% or more of the voting equity securities or other equivalent voting interests of the entity.</p>\n<p>Netlify shall own and retain all right, title and interest in and to the Services and related software, all improvements, enhancements or modifications thereto, and all intellectual property rights associated with the foregoing.\nExcept for the limited access rights expressly granted in this Section 2, Customer obtains no rights to Netlify Services or intellectual property rights by implication, estoppel or otherwise.</p>3.\nUsage Restrictions<p>Please refer to the Terms of Use Agreement at https://www.netlify.com/legal/terms-of-use/ for use restrictions that apply to all activity through the Netlify website, including use of the Services.</p>\n<p>Customer shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of all of its usernames and passwords.\nCustomer is responsible for all activities that occur under Customer\u2019s account.\nThe Services may only be used or accessed by persons at least 13 years of age and through an electronic device under the direct control of Customer at all times.</p>\n<p>Netlify Managed DNS or Netlify functions are strictly for use with sites deployed to Netlify.\nIt is expressly allowed to have DNS <em>records</em> within Customer\u2019s zone pointing to non-Netlify resources, but we expect that all zones Customer hosts with Netlify also have at least one hostname hosted by Netlify, and all functions hosted by Netlify are called primarily by a website hosted on our Services.\nIn some cases, this paragraph may not apply to a Customer who has entered into a separate Enterprise Subscription Agreement with Netlify.</p>4.\nSubscription Term and Termination<p>Please refer to the subscription term stated in your account admin panel.\nYour subscription term will automatically renew for successive periods of the same duration, unless terminated as permitted below.</p>\n<p>For Free Usage Tier Customers, the Services may be terminated by either Netlify or Customer, without cause, immediately upon notice.</p>\n<p>For Paid Plan Customers, Customer may terminate the Services at any time via Customer\u2019s admin panel or via notice sent to Netlify\u2019s support addresses.\nAs discussed below, fees paid for the subscription term are not refundable in case of early termination.\nPlease note that any termination via the Customer\u2019s admin panel must be done at least one (1) day prior to the end of the then-current subscription term to avoid charges for the renewal term, and any termination not completed via the Customer\u2019s admin panel must be done by written notice at least ten (10) days prior to the end of the then-current subscription term to avoid charges for the renewal term.</p>\n<p>For Paid Plan Customers, Netlify may terminate the subscription term immediately upon notice if the Customer fails to comply with any of the terms of this Agreement or the Terms of Use Agreement.\nNetlify will not terminate a Paid Plan Customer for convenience during the subscription term.</p>5.\nFees.\nNo Refunds<p>Customer shall pay the fees applicable to the Paid Plan that Customer selected at the time of initial sign-up.\nCustomer may opt to upgrade or downgrade to any other Paid Plan that Netlify is currently offering at any time during Customer\u2019s subscription term.\nprovided that a downgrade will be not be effective until the renewal of subscription term.\nIf a Customer\u2019s use exceeds the Services capacity applicable to the Customer\u2019s selected Paid Plan, Customer will incur and agrees to pay additional fees that reflect actual usage, as such fees are described in the terms of the selected Paid Plan.\nFor Free Usage Tier Customers, if use exceeds the Services capacity applicable to the Free Usage Tier, Customer will incur and agrees to pay additional fees that reflect actual usage, as such fees are described in the terms of the Free Usage Tier description.</p>\n<p>All fees are non-cancelable and non-refundable, including in case of Customer\u2019s termination of the subscription term.\nCustomer pays in advance total fees for the subscription term, and in advance at renewal for any renewal term.\nNo refunds will be provided for the unused portion of the subscription term or renewal term in case of termination.\nFollowing any termination, however, Customer will continue to have access to the Paid Plan Services through the end of Customer\u2019s then-current subscription term.</p>\n<p>Netlify reserves the right to change the fees or to institute new charges or to otherwise change the terms and conditions applicable to the Paid Plans.\nprovided, however, that any such changes will apply <em>only</em> (a) to new Services procured after the changes.\nand (b) to continuing Services for any renewal term(s) starting after notice of such changes was provided or such earlier time as Customer affirmatively accepts the modified terms.</p>\n<p>Customer is responsible for all sales, use, value added and similar taxes of any nature associated with Services other than U.S.\ntaxes based on Netlify\u2019s income.</p>6.\nFree Usage Tier<p>Netlify\u2019s Free Usage Tier is made available by Netlify to allow users to experience Netlify\u2019s Services, but the Free Usage Tier is offered at Netlify\u2019s sole discretion.\nNetlify reserves the right to change the terms and conditions applicable to the Free Usage Tier, or to discontinue it.\nWhile we always make an effort to communicate clearly and well in advance if we decide a particular website project is not a good fit for our Free Usage Tier, we reserve the right to disable or remove any website project on Netlify\u2019s Free Usage Tier without notice at our sole discretion.\nFree Usage Tier website projects will reside in a common build environment shared by all Free Usage Tier users with no service level commitments.\nNetlify may shut down Free Usage Tier website projects without notice for any reason or no reason.\nIn case of any delays or performance problems including those caused by a malicious attack on a website project, for the Free Usage Tier Netlify will resolve the issue by shutting down the affected website projects.</p>7.\nCustomer Data<p>Customer shall own all right, title and interest in and to all information provided by Customer in connection with Services (\u201cCustomer Data\u201d).\nNetlify may use, distribute and disclose Customer Data in order to provide the Services to Customer and to maintain the associated Customer website projects.\nNetlify shall have the right to use and analyze Customer Data to administer, improve, customize, enhance and develop its products and services, including the Services.\nUpon termination, Netlify will make all Customer Data available to Customer for electronic retrieval for a period of thirty (30) days, but thereafter Netlify may, but is not obligated to, delete stored Customer Data.\nCustomer acknowledges that Netlify may share Customer Data if the disclosure is necessary to comply with a valid court order or subpoena.</p>\n<p>Netlify shall have the right to collect and analyze data and other information relating to the provision, use and performance of various aspects of the Services and related systems.\nNetlify will use such data to administer, improve and develop its products and services, including the Services.\nand Netlify may share aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties.</p>\n<p>All personal information provided by Customer will be subject to the Netlify Privacy Policy found at https://www.netlify.com/privacy/.</p>8.\nWarranty Disclaimer<p>THE SERVICES ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMER ON AN \u201cAS IS\u201d AND \u201cAS AVAILABLE\u201d BASIS, AND NETLIFY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A

SERVICES, ITS SAFETY OR SECURITY, OR THE CONTENT, OR THE SERVICE\u2019S INTEROPERABILITY, UNAVAILABILITY OR SECURITY VULNERABILITIES.\nSOME JURISDICTIONS MAY PROHIBIT A DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND CUSTOMER MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.</p>9.\nIndemnity<p>Customer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Netlify and its officers, directors and employees, from and against all third party claims, losses, damages, costs and liabilities, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, arising out of or relating to Customer\u2019s use of the Services or use of the Website, Customer\u2019s Content, Customer\u2019s Data or any products or services offered by Customer to a third party, or obtained by Customer from a third party, via the
