We use this to help us serve our website speedily and enable various features</li>\n<li>Plausible.io - We use this to show us how many people view our website every day and where they came from.</li>\n<li>Datadog - We use this to handle crash reports and anonymized usage statistics sent from the applications.\nAll data is removed automatically after 30 days.</li>\n<li>Discord, Twitter, Reddit etc\u2026 - We use these to engage with the community and offer support</li>\n</ul>Collection of data from minors:<p>Our Services are intended for individuals 18 years of age and older.\nWe do not knowingly collect any information, from anyone under 18 years of age.\nIf you believe that we have inadvertently collected Personal Data from someone under the age of 18, please contact us immediately at https://redact.dev/contact so that we may delete the data.</p>Changes to this privacy policy:<p>This privacy policy may change without notice to you, as we don't have contact information for the vast majority of our users.\nYou can keep track of any changes to this page by using a service such as https://visualping.io/.</p>Data deletion requests:<p>Any user without limitation may contact us to delete all data we have on them, No questions asked.\nThis can be done by contacting us via https://redact.dev/contact.</p>International Visitors / GDPR:<p>This website, services, and company are all in the United States.\nIf you use the Site or the Services from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from US law, please note that you are transferring your personal data to the US, which has different laws than your country.</p>Governing Law:<p>Unless applicable data protection / privacy laws provide otherwise, (a) the Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware U.S.A., (b) you hereby agree that any dispute or claim raised or made by you against us relating to the Privacy Policy shall be subject to arbitration before a single arbitrator in Miami, Florida in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association and (c) you hereby waive all rights to bring or maintain any court action, jury trial or any class claim, class action, class arbitration, or other representative action, claim or proceeding against us in a court of law.</p>Got a specific question?<p>Join our Discord server and we will directly answer your questions in real time!</p>Join Redact DiscordHomeDownloadServicesFeaturesPricingTeamContactSupportPress KitTerms &amp.\nConditionsPrivacyPress KitPrivacy PolicyTerms &amp.\nConditions\u00a9 2023 Redact -
