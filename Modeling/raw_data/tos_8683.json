LLC.\n(\"Musicbed\" or \"Licensor\"), a Texas limited liability company with its principal office located in Tarrant County, Texas, for the purpose of Licensee's use of certain rights in and to musical compositions and sound recordings (termed \"Recordings\" hereafter).\nBy downloading Recordings from our website, you agree to conduct this transaction electronically and you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement in respect to those Recordings.\nIf you do not accept or agree with these terms, do not download Recordings.</p>\n<p>The use of the Recordings is strictly subject to the terms, conditions, and restrictions set forth Sections I and II of this Agreement.\nIf any of the Licensee-provided information in Section I is missing, omitted, or incorrect, this license may be invalidated by Musicbed.\nThis license is for a single film project intended to promote a single organization, entity, company, product, or the like (collectively referred to as \"End Client\").\nPlacement of the brand, logo, name, or other identifier of more than one End Client on the project is a violation of the terms of this agreement.\nCo-branded projects, i.e., those featuring the brand, logo, name, or other identifier of more than one End Client, require a custom written license from Musicbed.</p>\n<p>1.\nYou acknowledge that each of the Recordings is the property of Licensor and its musicians, producers, and composers (\"Artists\").\nIf you are entering this Agreement on behalf of an organization, entity, or company, then that entity is bound to the license granted and the restrictions and limitations detailed herein (and such entity or organization is included in the term \"Licensee\") regardless of your future employment and/or relationship with such entity.\nYou acknowledge representations you made regarding license details including project type, size, distribution, paid advertising, territory, term and exclusivity are true and correct.</p>\n<p>2.\nIn consideration of the mutual promises contained herein, and the payment to Licensor in Section I of this Agreement (amount listed under fee), Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Recordings of those Artists represented by Licensor, subject to the terms and conditions set forth within this Agreement and &nbsp;Musicbed's Terms of Use&nbsp.\nwhich are incorporated herein by reference with the same force and effect as if fully set forth herein.</p>\n<p>3.\nWithout notice beforehand, Licensor may automatically terminate this Agreement in the event of Licensee's breach of Section II Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 12.a.\u2014j.\nof this Agreement.\nIn the event of any other type of breach or violation, Licensor may terminate this Agreement by giving notice in writing, as provided in Paragraph 19, by regular or registered mail to Licensee's physical address, or electronic communication such as email to Licensee at Licensee's provided email address.\nIf Licensee fails to remedy the breach complained of by Licensor within fourteen (14) days of the date of receipt mailing of the notice, then this Agreement shall automatically terminate on the fifteenth (15) day.\nIn the event of termination of this Agreement due to breach by Licensee, Licensor shall be entitled to retain any fees paid by Licensee pursuant to this Agreement in addition to further legal remedies.</p>\n<p>4.\nAfter termination of this Agreement, any use of the Recordings is prohibited and actionable as an act of infringement of copyright owned by the Artist or Licensor and actionable under any other applicable causes of action.</p>\n<p>5.\nThe uses of the Recordings are strictly subject to the rules set forth in this Agreement.</p>\n<p>6.\nLicensor represents and warrants that it owns or controls 100% of the copyright in the composition and 100% of the copyright in the Master and has the right to grant the rights granted to Licensee under this agreement.</p>\n<p>7.\nThe Recordings and accompanying materials (if applicable) are provided \"as is\" without warranties or conditions of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.\nLicensor does not represent or warrant that the recordings will meet Licensee's requirements or that its use will be uninterrupted or error free.\nThe entire risk as to the quality and performance of the recordings is with Licensee.\nShould the recordings prove defective, Licensee, and not Licensor, assumes the entire cost of all necessary corrections.</p>\n<p>8.\nLICENSOR'S entire liability and Licensee's exclusive remedy, with respect to any claims arising out of Licensee's use of the Recordings or accompanying material (if applicable), or out of Licensee's actions in downloading such, shall be as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Licensee may, upon request to Licensor, be permitted to download the Recordings again, at a location provided by Licensor;</li>\n<li>If Licensee continues to be unable to download the Recordings, Licensor will refund the fee actually paid by Licensee in respect of the use of such Recordings, provided Licensor determines in its sole and absolute discretion that Licensee has been unable to download such Recordings successfully.</li>\n<li>In no event shall Licensor or any of its directors, officers, employees, shareholders, partners, or agents be liable for any incidental, indirect, punitive, exemplary, or consequential damages whatsoever (including damages for loss of profits, interruption, loss of business information, or any other pecuniary loss) in connection with any claim, loss, damage, action, suit or other proceeding arising under or out of this agreement, including without limitation Licensee's use of, reliance upon, access to, or exploitation of the recordings, or any part thereof, or any rights granted to Licensee hereunder, even if Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages, whether the action is based on contract, tort (including negligence), infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise.</li>\n<li>In any event, Licensor's total maximum aggregate liability under this agreement, the license provided hereunder, or the use or exploitation of any or all of the recordings in any manner whatsoever shall be limited to the fees actually paid by Licensee to Licensor under this Agreement in respect of the use of the recordings.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>9.\nThis License is personal to the Licensee and strictly subject to the exercise of the rights set out herein.\nThe rights and obligations set forth in this Agreement may not be assigned or otherwise transferred without Licensor's prior written consent.\nLicensor may assign this Agreement without Licensee's consent.</p>\n<p>10.\nTo the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Musicbed, and its officers, managers, members, employees, attorneys, representatives, and agents, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from: (a) your use of this Agreement.\n(b) your violation of any term of this Agreement.\n(c) your violation of any third party right, including without limitation, any copyright, property, or privacy right.\nor (d) any claim that your use of this Agreement caused damage to a third party.</p>\n<p>11.\nThe performance of any Recording in the exhibition of any program materials authorized hereunder may be made by systems having valid performance licenses from the American Society of Composers Authors and Publishers (\"ASCAP\"), Broadcast Music, Inc.\n(\"BMI\"), Society of European Stage, Authors and Composers (\"SESAC\") or other applicable performing rights societies, as the case may be.\nThe performance of any Composition in the exhibition of any program materials authorized hereunder by systems not having licenses there from is subject to clearance of the performing right either from ASCAP, BMI, SESAC or other applicable performing rights society, in accordance with their customary practices and the payment of their customary fees.\nThis agreement shall not supersede any clearances with regard to any Composition or Master authorized hereunder as required by performance right societies in such portion of the Territory as is outside of the United States and its possessions, which shall be in accordance with their customary practices and the payment of their customary fees to the extent required hereunder.</p>\n<p>12.\nUnless otherwise stated in Section I of this Agreement, Licensee agrees that it shall not use the Recordings in any of the manners described below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Projects and products which incorporate Recordings may not be monetized, which involves the Licensee:</li>\n<ol>\n<li>placing a video or videos containing Recordings on video hosting services such as, but not limited to, YouTube, AND;</li>\n<li>authorizing the presence of paid advertising with such video(s), and</li>\n<li>being entitled to a share of the revenues from any such advertising.</li>\n</ol>\n<li>The Recordings may not be sold as standalone music files, or included in any other media/stock product, library, or collection for distribution or resale.\nLicensee may not disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer, translate, or otherwise decode the Recordings for any reason whatsoever.</li>\n<li>Recordings may not be used for product that is intended for resale, such as, but not limited to, digital product (electronic templates for websites or applications, software and mobile applications, video games, stock elements or films/illustrations for resale) or physical product (DVDs, BluRay, or external media storage such as USB drives).</li>\n<li>If Licensee provides Recordings or works incorporating the Recordings to a client as part of its work product, the client may not reuse the Recordings or works incorporating the Recordings for any other purpose.</li>\n<li>Recordings may not under any circumstances be used in or in conjunction with, or in any way that might be considered pornographic, obscene, abusive, immoral, illegal or inciteful of an illegal act.</li>\n<li>Recordings shall not be used in conjunction with sensitive subject matter without the prior written consent of Musicbed.\nsensitive subject matter includes but is not limited to sexual activity or sexual-oriented nudity.\ntobacco, alcohol, or drug use.\nhealth issues and bodily functions.\nillegal activities.\nexcessive or graphic violence.\nand political content.</li>\n<li>Recordings may not be used in a way that may be considered invasive of privacy, defamatory, libelous, or fraudulent, false or misleading or in a way that is hateful or derogatory of any race, nationality, ethnic identity, gender, gender identity or sexual orientation, or political or religious belief, whether directly or in context or juxtaposition with other materials.</li>\n<li>Recordings may not be used in any manner that creates a false inference or places the Recordings in a context that is likely to result in bringing the Recordings, Musicbed, or any Artist into (1) public disrespect, (2) scorn, (3) contempt, (4) scandal, (5) ridicule, or (6) that is likely to shock, insult, or offend the community or public morals or decency or prejudice Musicbed, any of its Artists, or any person or property in the Recordings, or otherwise detract from or negatively affect the public image of Musicbed or any of its Artists.</li>\n<li>Licensee is not permitted to purchase Recordings directly from our website for use in non-fungible tokens (\u201cNFTs\u201d) or digital collectibles.\nLicensee is required to execute a custom license agreement with Licensor for any Recording(s) that Licensee intends to incorporate into NFTs or other digital collectibles.\nThe failure to create a custom footage license under this Subparagraph constitutes a material breach of this Agreement and shall permit Licensor to immediately terminate the license agreement(s) and seek all available legal remedies.</li>\n<li>Recordings may not be used in any manner that misrepresents the source of the music licensing under this Agreement.\nRecordings may not be purchased and used by employees, contractors or agents of competitive licensing platforms (\u201cMusicbed Competitors\u201d) for the advertisement of the Musicbed Competitor\u2019s own website, services, or related affiliate projects.\nLicensor reserves the right to terminate this Agreement in the event of a breach of this Subparagraph.\nUnder this Agreement, a \u201cMusicbed Competitor\u201d is defined as any entity that provides 1) single song music licensing, 2) music licensing subscription services, 3) custom music and scores, and music supervision services.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>13.\nThe parties to this Agreement are independent contractors and neither party shall make any representation otherwise.\nNothing in this Agreement will create any partnership, joint venture, agency, franchise, sales representation, or employment relationship between the parties.\nNeither party has authority to make or accept any offers or representations on behalf of the other party.</p>\n<p>14.\nLicensor and Licensee agree that any use of Recordings in a manner not expressly authorized by this Agreement or in breach of a term of this Agreement constitutes copyright infringement, and such unauthorized use shall entitle Licensor to liquidated damages in the amount of ten (10) times the standard license fee for each breach.\nThe parties in this contract agree that Licensor's actual damages in the event of this type of breach by Licensee would be difficult to definitively ascertain based on uncertainties regarding (1) the impact to Licensor's reputation and goodwill in the industry and (2) the damage to Licensor's relationships with its current and future Artists.\nLicensor and Licensee therefore agree that the above-referenced amount is not a penalty for breach and is a reasonable liquidated damages amount.\nThese liquidated damages are cumulative of and without prejudice to Licensor's other remedies, including but not limited to injunctive relief and applicable legal remedies.</p>\n<p>In addition, Musicbed and/or its Artists shall have the right, without providing prior notice to Licensee, to issue a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) notice (as provided by 17 U.S.C.\n\u00a7512 and any successor statute) to any site or outlet in which the project appears or is placed in violation of the terms of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>The foregoing is not a limiting statement of Licensor's or its Artists' rights or remedies in connection with any unauthorized use of the Recordings or any breach of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>15.\nThis Agreement may not be modified, altered or amended, except by written instrument duly executed by both parties.</p>\n<p>16.\nNo failure or delay by either party in exercising any right hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof.</p>\n<p>17.\nAny attempt by Licensee to assign this Agreement other than as permitted above will be null and void.\nThis Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.</p>\n<p>18.\nIf any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>\n<p>19.\nAll notices required under this Agreement shall be (a) either electronic or in writing, (b) deemed to have been duly made and received when (i) personally served, (ii) electronically received, (iii) delivered by commercially established courier service, or iv) five (5) days after deposit in mail via certified mail, return receipt requested, to the addresses specified below or at such other address as the parties shall designate in writing from time to time.\nAddress
