Policy applies whenever you access and use Lemon8.\n\u201cLemon8\u201d includes our website, services, applications, products and content (collectively, the \u201c<strong>Lemon8 Platform</strong>\u201d).</p>\n<p>Like many websites and apps, Lemon8 uses cookies and similar technologies such as software development kits (<strong>SDKs</strong>) and local storage.\nThese technologies allow us to store information or gain access to information stored on your device to enable certain features and distinguish your device from others.\nCookies and similar technologies are used by most apps and website providers to recognise that a device is the same as one used previously, for security, to remember user preferences and to generally improve user experience.\nThis Policy explains what these technologies are and how we use them.</p>\n1.\nWhat technologies are used?\n<p>Lemon8 uses the following kinds of technologies:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies</strong>: Cookies are small text files that enable us and our service providers and partners to uniquely identify your browser or device for various purposes, including those described above.\nCookies normally work by assigning a unique number to your device and are stored on your browser by the websites that you visit as well as third party service providers and partners to those websites.</p>\n<p>Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time.\nSome cookies are \"session cookies\", meaning that they exist only while your browser is open and are deleted automatically once you close your browser.</p>\n<p>Other cookies are \"persistent cookies\", meaning that they survive after your browser is closed.\nMost persistent cookies are set to automatically expire after a defined duration (for example, a few days, weeks or months).\nWhen you return to that website (or visit other websites that use the same cookies) the website provider or its service providers can recognise the persistent cookies they have set and recognise your browsing device.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Local storage</strong>: Local storage files are created by apps and websites to store information locally on your device.\nThey are very similar to cookies, but can have slightly different properties (for example, local storage can be used to store more information and can be stored in a different location on your device compared to cookies).\nLocal storage is normally used to speed up app and website functionality and remember your preferences.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>SDKs</strong>: SDKs are pieces of code that enable data to be collected about your device, network and interaction with a website.\nLike cookies, they generally operate by assigning your device a unique number.</p>\n2.\nCategories of cookies and similar technologies\n<p>The types of cookies and similar technologies used by us and our partners in connection with the provision of the Lemon8 Platform can be classified into the following categories.\nSome of these categories are \u201cessential\u201d to provide you with the services you have requested, such as to securely log into the Lemon8 Platform.\nThe following is a list of of the categories of cookies and similar technologies we use:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Identification and Security</strong>: Identification and security cookies and similar technologies help us keep you and the Lemon8 Platform secure, recognise you when you return to the Lemon8 Platform to make sure that you are the right user and prevent activity that violates our policies.\nRemembering your preferences: We need to remember the settings you have chosen on the Lemon8 Platform so that they work how you want them to.\nFor example, we use these technologies in order to remember what languages you want to see content in, and the privacy setting you apply to your posts.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Functionality</strong>: Functionality cookies and similar technologies make the Lemon8 Platform work more efficiently and to improve and optimize your experience.\nFor example, to determine which device you use, the software version and the screen dimensions so that we can ensure that our app functions correctly.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Analytics</strong>: We use analytics cookies and similar technologies to analyse how you use the Lemon8 Platform, including which pages you view most often, how you interact with the content, measure any errors that occur and test different design ideas.\nThe information is used to report and evaluate your activities and patterns as a user of the Lemon8 Platform.\nFor example, we may test new features to help us decide which features users prefer.</p>\n3.\nDo other parties use these technologies on the Lemon8 Platform?\n<p>Cookies and similar technologies can either be \u201cfirst-party\u201d or \u201cthird-party\u201d.\nFirst-party cookies and similar technologies refer to technologies that we set and use directly.\nThird-party cookies and similar technologies refer to technologies set by third parties (such as analytics service providers).\nWe use first-party and third-party cookies and similar technologies on the Lemon8 Platform.</p>\n4.\nHow can I control these technologies?\n<p>You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies.\nAs the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser to browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information.</p>\n5.\nWhere can I find more information about these technologies?\n<p>If you would like to find out more about these technologies, you may find the following links useful:\nAll about cookies\nEU Guide to Cookies\nYour Online Choices</p>\n6.\nChanges to this Policy\n<p>We will occasionally update this Policy to reflect changes in our practices.\nWhen we post changes to this Policy, we will revise the \"Last Updated\" date at the top of this Policy.\nIf we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share information using these technologies, we will notify you by prominently posting notice of the changes in the Lemon8 Platform.\nWe recommend that you check this page from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Policy.</p>\n7.\nContact us\n<p>If you have any questions or comments about this Policy, or privacy matters generally,

Jurisdiction-Specific\n<p>\n<strong>US.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</strong> This Section includes an arbitration agreement and an agreement that all claims will be brought only in an individual capacity (and not as a class action or other representative proceeding).\nPlease read it carefully.\nYou may opt out of the arbitration agreement by following the opt out procedure described below.</p>\n<p>Informal Process First.\nYou agree that in the event of any dispute between you and Lemon8, you will first contact Lemon8 and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action.</p>\n<p>Arbitration Agreement.\nAfter the informal dispute resolution process any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, \u201cClaim\u201d) relating in any way to your use of Lemon8\u2019s services and/or products, including the Services, or relating in any way to the communications between you and Lemon8 or any other user of the Services, will be finally resolved by binding arbitration.\nThis mandatory arbitration agreement applies equally to you and Lemon8.\nHowever, this arbitration agreement does not (a) govern any Claim by Lemon8 for infringement of its intellectual property or access to the Services that is unauthorized or exceeds authorization granted in these Terms or (b) bar you from making use of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate cases.\nIf you are an individual you may opt out of this arbitration agreement within thirty (30) days of the first of the date you access or use this Services by following the procedure described below.</p>\n<p>You agree that the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Lemon8 are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.\nThis arbitration provision will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>\n<p>If you wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, after following the informal dispute resolution procedure, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to:</p>\n<p>Heliophilia Pte.\nLtd., 1 Raffles Quay, #26-10, South Tower, Singapore 048583</p>\n<p>Email Address: contact@lemon8-app.com</p>\n<p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules including, if you are an individual, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.\nIf you are not an individual or have used the Services on behalf of an entity, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will not be used.\nThe AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.</p>\n<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.\nIf you are an individual and have not accessed or used the Services on behalf of an entity, we will reimburse those fees for claims where the amount in dispute is less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable.\nHowever, the preceding sentence will not apply to the \u201cClass Action Waiver\u201d section below.</p>\n<p>If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Lemon8 and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to contact@lemon8-app.com within thirty (30) days of the first of the date you access or use the Services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Class Action Waiver.</strong> Any Claim must be brought in the respective party\u2019s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (\u201cClass Action\u201d).\nThe parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum.\nIf the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration.\nAny claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.\nThe parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration.</p>\n<p>If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void.\nThe arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.\nIf for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Lemon8 each waive any right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p>If a counter-notice is received by Lemon8\u2019s Copyright Agent, we may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that we may replace the removed content or cease disabling it.\nUnless the original complaining party files an action seeking a court order against the Content Provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in ten business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Lemon8\u2019s sole discretion.</p>\n<p>Please understand that filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party to determine ownership.\nBe aware that there may be adverse legal consequences in your country if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>California Consumer Rights Notice.</strong> Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California users of the Services receive the following specific consumer rights
