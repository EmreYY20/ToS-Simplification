any transactions and payments you carry out through the Wolt Services.</p>\n<p>\n<i>User Data that is necessary in order to use the Wolt Services</i>\n</p>\n<p>The following personal data collected

customer relationship.\nSuch data is primarily obtained from public sources such as local trade registers, companies providing this type of information services, or the companies

appropriate and justifiable interest (that is, a legitimate interest) to run, maintain and develop our business or to create and maintain customer relationships.\nWhen choosing to use your data on the basis of our legitimate interests, we weigh our own interests against your right to privacy and, for example, provide you with easy to use opt-out from our marketing communications and use pseudonymized or non-personally identifiable data when possible.\nYou have the right to object processing of your data on the basis of legitimate interest.\nHowever, Wolt can refuse such an objection in accordance with applicable legislation, for example, if the processing is necessary for preparing, exercising or defending legal claims.</p>\n<p>We process your personal data to the extent

the purposes for which Wolt processes the User's personal data and of records regarding the provision of personal data to third parties.\nUnder the Japanese Personal Data Protection Law, when personal

applies:</p>\n<p>\n<i>For the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement and to authorized service providers</i>\n</p>\n<p>To the extent that third parties (such as the restaurants, merchants or retailers which provide your order, our courier partners who deliver your order and Customer Organization which may pay your order) need access to personal data in order for us to perform the Wolt Services or for other legitimate reasons, we provide such third parties with your data.\nAs an example, we may share your phone number with the Partner you ordered from if it's necessary, for example, for asking you whether you accept a replacement product in the order or to inform you that an item is missing from your order or for any special request clarifications.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we may provide your personal data to our group companies or to authorized service providers who perform services for us (including data storage, accounting, analytics, sales and marketing and payment fraud prevention) to process it for us and to payment service providers to process your payments to us.\n</p>\n<p>When data is processed by third parties on behalf of Wolt, Wolt has taken the appropriate contractual and organizational measures to ensure that your data are processed exclusively for the purposes specified in this Privacy Statement and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations and subject to our instructions and appropriate obligations of confidentiality and security measures.</p>\n<p>Please bear in mind that if you provide personal data directly to a third party, such as through a link in the Wolt Services, the processing is typically based on their policies and standards.</p>\n<p>\n<i>With Partners for the performance of Wolt Services</i>\n</p>\n<p>To the extent that third parties, such as the Partners which prepare, sell and/or deliver your order, our courier partners who deliver your order and Customer Organization which may pay your order, need access to personal data in order for us to perform the Wolt Services, we provide such third parties with your data.</p>\n<p>We provide the Partner and where applicable, its parent company or franchisor, with personal data necessary to fulfill your order.\nDepending on the Partner\u2019s role this may include your name, delivery address and data relating to your purchase, including venue details, order number, time of order and delivery, delivery method, ordered products, comments and feedback that you've given about the order.\nSuch data is shared for enabling the Partner to provide the order including, where applicable, picking up the products in the store, ensuring the quality of the Partner's service and product selection available at Wolt as well as complying with Partner's legal obligations.\nWhere Partner processes such details for purposes of fulfilling its own rights and obligations, such as its legal obligations towards you, Partner is independent controller of the Personal Data and responsible for the lawfulness of its processing operations.</p>\n<p>You may be able to add the details of your Partner-specific bonus card or loyalty program on the Wolt Service for purposes of linking any orders placed at the Partner to the relevant loyalty program, in accordance with the terms defined by Partner.\nWolt will share such details to the Partner and Partner is independent controller of such details and thereby responsible for ensuring lawfulness of the processing.</p>\n<p>We may also share your phone number and name with the Partner you ordered from if it's necessary, for example, for asking you whether you accept a replacement product in the order or to inform you that an item is missing from your order or for any special request clarifications or other necessary purposes related to completing the order.\nFor deliveries that are performed by our merchant partners themselves we may also share your delivery address and phone number with those Partners.\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>For legal reasons and legal processes</i>\n</p>\n<p>We may share your personal data with third parties outside Wolt if we have a good-faith belief that access to and use of the personal data is reasonably necessary to: (i) meet any applicable law, regulation, and/or court order.\n(ii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, crime, security or technical issues.\nand/or (iii) protect the interests, properties or safety of Wolt, the Users or the public as far as in accordance with the law.\nWhen possible, we will inform you about such processing.</p>\n<p>\n<i>For other legitimate reasons</i>\n</p>\n<p>If Wolt is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we may transfer your personal data to the third party involved.\nHowever, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of all personal data.\nWe will give notice to all the Users concerned when the personal data are transferred or become subject to a different privacy statement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<i>With your explicit consent</i>\n</p>\n<p>We may share your personal data with third parties outside Wolt when we have your explicit consent to do so.\nYou have the right to withdraw this consent at all times free of charge, for example, by contacting us.</p>\n<b>7.\nSTORAGE PERIOD</b>\n<p>Wolt does not store your personal data longer than is legally permitted and necessary for the purposes of providing the Wolt Services or the relevant parts thereof.\nThe storage period depends on the nature of the information and on the purposes of
