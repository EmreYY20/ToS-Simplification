research.\nOur philosophy is that what you put into Zotero is yours, and one of our founding principles is to make sure you remain in control of your data and can share it how you like \u2014 or choose not to share it at all.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We are an independent, nonprofit organization and have no financial interest in your private information.</strong> We fund further development by offering additional online storage space to people who find the software useful, not by selling data.\n</p> Data We Collect <p>\nZotero is designed as a local program that saves data to your own computer by default, and it doesn\u2019t require sharing any data with us to be usable.\nHowever, some of Zotero\u2019s advanced features require you to supply us with information.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> We collect the information you voluntarily provide (e.g., your name and email address) if you create a Zotero account and use optional Zotero services.\nZotero can be used without creating an account.\n</li>\n<li> We collect the library data you upload if you choose to synchronize your library with the Zotero servers.\nSyncing is entirely optional and is disabled by default.\n</li>\n<li> We collect the attachment files you upload if you choose to use Zotero file syncing.\nFile syncing is optional, and you can choose to sync files in your personal library using a WebDAV server instead.\n</li>\n<li> We keep a record of the most recent IP addresses used to access your synchronized library in order to let you verify the security of your account and allow you to revoke access in your Zotero settings.\n</li>\n<li> We log visits to our website, including IP address and browser, in order to prevent abuse and to diagnose technical issues.\nWe retain these access logs for 90 days.\n</li>\n<li> We log requests made to our servers by Zotero or third-party software, including IP address and client information, in order to prevent abuse, diagnose technical issues, and assess usage.\nWe retain these logs for up to 90 days.\nYou can opt out of all requests to our servers.\n</li>\n<li> We collect error reports that you submit.\nSee Support Interactions.\n</li>\n<li> If you attempt to save something to Zotero and the save fails, we collect information about the failure, including the URL, browser, and version information, so that we can more quickly fix site compatibility issues.\nWe store this information for up to one week.\nNo additional personally identifying information (e.g., username or IP address) is stored, and reports are generally only viewed in aggregate.\nThis error reporting can be disabled in the Zotero and Zotero Connector preferences.\n</li>\n</ul> Library Statistics <p>\nZotero anonymizes and aggregates synchronized user and group library data to generate statistics on readership.\nThis anonymized and aggregated data only includes publicly available metadata (e.g., publication title and author).\nThis data is never sold or made available in any forms other than ones offered publicly.\nWe may also use this anonymized and aggregated user information for auditing, research, and analysis to operate and improve Zotero services.\n</p> Security of Stored Data <p>\nSee Security of Zotero Data.\n</p> Disabling Automatic Requests <p>\nYou can disable all automatic communication with Zotero servers from the Zotero and Zotero Connector preferences:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Syncing:</strong> Sync preferences \u2192 leave unconfigured or disable automatic syncing\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Automatic PDF metadata retrieval:</strong> General preferences \u2192 disable \u201cAutomatically retrieve metadata for PDFs\u201d\n<ul>\n<li> We do not log any information about the contents of PDF metadata requests.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Open-access PDF retrieval:</strong> General preferences \u2192 disable \u201cAutomatically attach associated PDFs and other files when saving items\u201d\n<ul>\n<li> If a PDF can't be saved for an item with a DOI, Zotero will send the DOI to Zotero servers to check for open-access versions.\nWe do not log the contents of these requests.\nDisabling this preference will disable all automatic attachment saving.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Broken site translator reporting:</strong> disable \u201cReport broken site translators\u201d in the Advanced pane of Zotero and the Zotero Connector\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Translator/style update checking:</strong> Advanced preferences \u2192 disable \u201cAutomatically check for updated translators and styles\u201d\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Zotero update checking:</strong> Advanced preferences \u2192 Config Editor \u2192 set <code>app.update.auto</code> to false\n<ul>\n<li> Automatic update checking is strongly recommended for security and stability reasons.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Retracted item checking:</strong> Advanced preferences \u2192 Config Editor \u2192 set <code>retractions.enabled</code> to false\n<ul>\n<li> Retraction checks are performed without sharing the items you have in your database.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Proxy authentication checking:</strong> Advanced \u2192 Config Editor \u2192 set <code>extensions.zotero.triggerProxyAuthentication</code> to false.\n<ul>\n<li> At Zotero startup, HEAD requests are made to a test file on Amazon S3 and selected publisher websites (controlled by <code>extensions.zotero.proxyAuthenticationURLs</code>) to trigger a proxy authentication prompt if and only if Zotero detects that a proxy is required to connect to the internet.\nIf you disable this option and require an authenticated proxy, Zotero network connections will fail.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nIf automatic syncing or automatic translator/style updates are enabled, Zotero will maintain a persistent connection to Zotero servers when it is open in order to provide immediate updates.\nYou can disable this connection by disabling both of those options or by setting <code>extensions.zotero.streaming.enabled</code> to false in the Config Editor.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you use the Zotero Connector without having Zotero open, the Connector will make a daily request to Zotero servers for information on available site translators.\nIt will then download translators for the sites you visit.\nFor example, if you load a <i>New York Times</i> article, the Connector will download Zotero\u2019s <i>New York Times</i> translator and cache it.\nIf Zotero doesn\u2019t have a translator for a specific site, no request will be made.\nNo information on the specific pages you visit is transmitted, and subsequent requests won\u2019t be made for the same translator until you restart your browser or the translator is updated.\nYou can avoid these requests by keeping Zotero open while you browse the web.\n</p> Permissions Warnings <p>\nWhen using third-party platforms, we request the most restrictive permissions available that still allow Zotero to perform its advertised functions.\nIn some cases, the necessary permissions can sound a bit scary, so we want to explain why they\u2019re necessary.\n</p> Zotero Connector <p>\nWhen installing the Zotero Connector, your browser will warn you that the extension can \u201cRead and change all your data on the websites you visit\u201d (or similar).\nThis is the standard permission that browser extensions that run on all pages require.\nZotero uses it to determine what content it can save on a given page and update the save button accordingly, as well as to provide advanced features such as automatic proxy redirection and automatic RIS/BibTeX import.\nNo data is stored except when you choose to save a page to either your local or online Zotero library.\n</p> Google Docs Integration <p>\nWhen you first use Google Docs integration, Google will ask you to grant Zotero Google Docs Integration permission to \u201cSee, edit, create, and delete all your Google Docs documents\u201d.\nThe plugin requires this permission to insert citations into your documents.\nThe plugin doesn\u2019t do anything else with your document content and doesn\u2019t access documents other than the ones on which it\u2019s triggered.\nThe integration works entirely locally on your computer, so even when you trigger the plugin on a given document, nothing is sent to Zotero servers.\n</p> Storage Purchases <p>\nWe send two pieces of personal data to our payment processor at the time of purchase:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> your Zotero username, in order to associate your payment with your Zotero account\n</li>\n<li> your email address, so that the payment processor can send you a payment receipt\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nZotero does not collect or store your credit card, banking, or other payment information.\nWhen you enter your full name, billing address, and account numbers to complete a Zotero purchase, this information passes directly to our payment processor, and it never touches Zotero servers.\n</p> Support Interactions <p>\nMost Zotero support occurs in the public Zotero Forums.\nIf you would like to remove forum posts you have made, you may clear them yourself at any time, though we encourage you to leave your posts up for the benefit of others.\nIf you\u2019d prefer your forum posts to appear under a different name, you can change your forums username from your account settings.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou may be asked to submit an error report or debug output to help us troubleshoot problems.\nThese reports contain technical information about your computer, such as your operating system and installed browser extensions, and may include incidental personal information such as URLs of sites you visited before or while generating the report.\nYou can review the output of these reports before submitting them.\nWe don\u2019t store any personal information (username, IP address) that links the report to you, and we generally don\u2019t look at reports unless they are referenced by a Report ID or Debug ID in the Zotero Forums.\nReports are stored for up to one year.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you email us, we collect your email address and any other information you provide, and we may store your messages indefinitely to provide context for any future support requests you make.\n</p> Third-Party Services Used <ul>\n<li> All Zotero server data is stored in the United States in Amazon Web Services.\nSee Security of Zotero Data for more information.\n</li>\n<li> Certain operations you perform in Zotero may trigger requests to public third-party services such as Crossref or the Library of Congress for metadata retrieval.\nThese third parties may log your IP address and search terms (e.g., DOI or ISBN) according to their privacy policies, but no other identifying information is provided.\n</li>\n<li> When you save items to or update items in Zotero, Zotero may, depending on your settings, connect to the associated sites to download metadata or save PDFs or snapshots.\nThis is equivalent to loading those sites in your browser, and similar privacy implications apply.\nSee Zotero and Firewalls for access requirements.\n</li>\n<li> Some fonts on Zotero\u2019s websites are licensed from myfonts.com.\nIn order to verify Zotero\u2019s compliance with this license, myfonts.com collects your IP address and the URL of the accessed Zotero webpage.\n</li>\n<li> When an account is registered, we use Google reCAPTCHA to verify that it is not an automated registration attempt.\n</li>\n<li> Payment processing is provided by Stripe.\n</li>\n<li> When buyers are unable to use Stripe, we process payments with PayPal.\n</li>\n</ul> Deleting Your Data <p>\nYou may delete your Zotero account to remove information you voluntarily provided when you registered to use Zotero services and to remove the library data you provided if you chose to synchronize your library with Zotero servers.\nTo delete your account, visit your Zotero settings and click \u201cPermanently Delete Account\u201d.\n</p> Backed-up Data <p>\nWe make regular automated backups to protect against accidental loss of user data.\nThese backups are intended for disaster recovery and would be accessed only in the event of significant data loss.\nBackups may be retained for up to 6 months.\n</p> Legally Compelled Disclosure <p>\nWe may be legally required to comply with requests for data from law enforcement or government agencies.\n</p> Changes <p>\nWe may update our privacy policies over time.\nUp-to-date information, including details of new features, will always be available from this page.\n</p> Questions <p>\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding Zotero\u2019s privacy policies, please ask us in the Zotero Forums or email privacy@zotero.org.\n</p> Table of Contents <ul>\n<li>Zotero Privacy Policy\n<ul>\n<li>Overview</li>\n<li>Data We Collect</li>\n<li>Library

" You are here: start &gt.\nterms &gt.\nterms_of_service ZOTERO TERMS OF SERVICE <p>\nWelcome to zotero.org (the \u201cSite\u201d).\nZotero is a collection of services, including storage subscription services (the \u201cServices\u201d), integrated with the Zotero desktop software and the Site, operated by the Corporation for Digital Scholarship (\u201cCDS\u201d) from its offices within the United States on a not-for-profit basis.\nYour access to and use of the Services and the Site are subject to these Terms of Service (\u201cTerms of Service\u201d) and all applicable laws.\nCDS makes no representation that the Services made available on or accessed through the Site are appropriate or available for use in other locations, and access to them from territories where such access is illegal is prohibited.\nCDS may change or modify these Terms of Service, in whole or in part, at any time by updating this posting, without prior notice or liability to users.\nBy accessing and/or using the Services - whether you are a \u201cVisitor\u201d (which means that you simply browse the Site) or a \u201cRegistered User\u201d (which means that you have registered as a Zotero user with CDS) - you acknowledge that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and to comply with all applicable laws.\nThe terms \u201cyou\u201d, \u201cyour\u201d or \u201cuser\u201d, as used in these Terms of Service, refer to a Visitor or a Registered User.\n</p> 1.\nYour Account/Registration <p>\nRegistration is required to subscribe to the Services.\nYou must be 13 years or older to subscribe to the Services.\nIf you are between age 13 and 18, you confirm that you have your parent\u2019s or legal guardian\u2019s consent to use the Services, that both you and they have read and agreed to these Terms of Service, and they have agreed to be considered a Registered User for purposes of the account.\nBy registering, you represent and warrant to CDS that: (a) you are 18 years of age or older and the age of majority in your state of residence as of the time you register as a Registered User.\n(b) all information provided by you to CDS during the registration process is truthful, accurate and complete.\n(c) you will comply with all terms and conditions of these Terms of Service.\nand (d) you will not use the Services for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms of Services.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs a Registered User, you agree to maintain and promptly update your registration data as necessary to keep it accurate, current and complete.\nCDS may terminate your access to the Services, without prior notice or liability to you, if any of the information provided is found to be inaccurate, false, out of date or incomplete, or for violating these Terms of Service and/or the law.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs a Registered User, you acknowledge that you are solely responsible for all activities that occur under your account while using the Services.\nYou agree to abide by all applicable laws in connection with your use of the Services, including those related to intellectual property rights, data privacy, international communications and the transmission of technical or personal data.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou are responsible for maintaining the security of your account as well as monitoring and controlling access to your account.\nYou agree to notify CDS immediately of any unauthorized use of any account, or any other known or suspected breach of security.\nCDS cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage in the event of an unauthorized use by a third party of your account.\nCDS, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Services, or any other service, for any reason at any time.\nTermination of the Services will result in the deactivation or deletion of your account or your access to your account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all content in your account.\nIf CDS terminates your account or services without cause, it will issue a pro-rata refund of any unused Services.\nCDS reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.\n</p> 2.\nYour Submissions and Other Data <p>\nCDS does not claim ownership of any data or other content you transmit, upload or store on or through the Services by any means (\u201cSubmissions\u201d).\nYou retain your rights to the Submissions you transmit, upload or store on or through the Services.\nYou are solely responsible for all your Submissions and all activity that occurs under your account.\nYou have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness, and intellectual property ownership or right to transmit, post or upload your Submissions and to grant the rights granted by you herein.\nBy using the Services, you automatically grant to CDS and its service providers a royalty-free license and right to store, display, process, modify, and retransmit your Submissions.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn order to provide and ensure the quality of the Zotero Services, we may collect and store certain data consistent with our Privacy Policy, which can be found at https://www.zotero.org/support/terms/privacy_policy and is incorporated herein by reference.\n</p>\n<p>\nCDS is not responsible for screening or monitoring data transmitted, uploaded or stored through the Services by you or other users.\nIf notified of any data transmitted, posted or uploaded through the Services allegedly in violation of these Terms of Service, CDS may investigate the allegation and determine in good faith and its sole discretion whether to remove such data or any portion thereof.\nCDS shall have no liability or responsibility to users for performance or nonperformance of such activities.\n</p>\n<p>\nCDS reserves the right not to store and to remove from storage any data uploaded or submitted through the Services for any reason, including, without limitation, any data that, in its sole discretion, it deems to be in violation of these Terms of Service.\n</p> 3.\nFees and Payment <p>\nThe Services are offered under free and/or paid subscriptions.\nOne person or legal entity may not maintain more than one free subscription.\nIf a free account is inactive (i.e., there has been no synchronization of files) for ninety (90) days, CDS reserves the right to delete any and all files in that account without notice or liability to you.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe fees for paid subscriptions are not license fees, but charges due for storage and related services.\nThe Zotero research tool and server software are released for free public use under several open source licenses, primarily the AGPLv3 - see the license text included with the code for details.\nThe source code is available at https://github.com/zotero/.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou agree to provide CDS with complete and accurate billing and credit card information in connection with your paid subscription(s).\nIf the information you have provided is false or fraudulent, CDS reserves the right to terminate your access to the Services in addition to any other legal remedies.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe fees for the paid services are set out at https://www.zotero.org/support/storage and are subject to change from time to time.\nYou agree to pay the subscription fees and any other charges (including any applicable taxes) for the specific paid Services plan you select in accordance with the fees and billing terms in effect at the time you subscribed to such services.\nAll fees and charges, when paid, are nonrefundable and accrue on the first day of the initial subscription term or successive renewal term until terminated, regardless of whether or not you actually use the Services.\n</p>\n<p>\nOnce you begin your annual billed paid subscription, your next payment would be due on the same date the following year.\nShould you elect to upgrade your paid subscription to a larger amount of storage space, you will be billed on the commencement date for the first year of the upgraded level of Services.\nYour initial new subscription term will be 12 months, plus the amount of time your remaining prepaid fees on your prior subscription would buy on a pro-rata basis under the new subscription.\nFor example, if you initially signed up for a $20/year subscription on January 1, 2000, your renewal date would be January 1, 2001.\nHowever if on July 1, 2000 you decided to upgrade to the $60/year subscription, your initial new subscription term would be 14 months \u2014 from July 1, 2000 to August 31, 2001.\nThis is because your initial new subscription would include an additional two months, as the prior unused subscription fee (here $10) would cover an additional two months under the $60/year subscription plan.\nAfter your initial new subscription term you would return to a 12-month subscription term.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou may downgrade your plan, but downgrading may cause the loss of content, features or capacity of your account.\nIf you opt to downgrade, you agree to be solely responsibility for any related loss.\nCDS cannot and will not be held liable for such loss.\n</p>\n<p>\nPayment for all paid subscriptions is handled for CDS by a third party service provider, and your credit card statement may include this provider's identifier.\nIf you believe any fees or charges to your account are incorrect, you must contact us in writing within thirty (30) days of the date of the bill containing the amount in question to be eligible to receive an adjustment or credit.\n</p>\n<p>\nCDS reserves the right to terminate a free account at any time in its sole discretion.\nCDS also reserves the right to impose fees, with at least fourteen (14) days prior notice to you, for your continued use of Services that were offered for free at the time you subscribed.\n</p> 4.\nRenewals <p>\nRenewal charges will be based on fees in effect at the time of renewal.\nCDS agrees to provide you at least fourteen (14) days prior notice of a fee increase via an email to the email associated with your account.\nSuch increase shall be effective upon renewal.\nThe paid subscription will automatically renew for fixed periods of time equal to your initial paid subscription purchase on the anniversary of your initial purchase.\nA paid subscription, however, will not be renewed automatically if you terminate such subscription in the manner and time described in Section 5 below.\nIf renewal fees are not paid in a timely manner, or if we are unable to process your transaction using the credit card information provided, CDS will provide you notice of your account delinquency.\nIf you do not bring your balance current within thirty (30) days after we provide you with notification that your account is in arrears, CDS reserves the right to delete some or all of your Submissions so as to reduce your storage space to below the ceiling of free subscriptions and to convert your paid subscription to a free subscription.\n</p> 5.\nPaid Subscription Termination <p>\nYou may terminate your paid subscription at any time through https://www.zotero.org/settings/storage.\nYou must terminate your paid subscription before its renewal date in order to avoid automatic renewal and a charge of the next period's fees to your credit card.\nIf you terminate your paid subscription, you will not be charged at the next renewal date.\nWe will not charge a fee for terminating your paid subscription.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you terminate your paid subscription and opt to continue using the Services on a free subscription basis, you will have reduced storage capacity and may lose content and features.\nIf you opt to do so, you agree to be solely responsible for such loss.\nCDS cannot and will not be held liable for such loss.\n</p> 6.\nAcceptable Use and Conduct/User Restrictions <p>\nAs a condition of your access and use of the Services, you agree that you will use the Services in compliance with these Terms of Service and all applicable laws, including any laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from your country of residence and all export controls and embargo restrictions under the laws of the United States.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou further agree that you shall not: (a) impersonate any individual or entity or misrepresent your affiliation with any other individual or entity.\n(b) use the Services in any manner with the intent to interrupt, damage, disable, overburden or impair the Services.\n(c) use the Services in violation of CDS' or any third party's intellectual property or other proprietary or legal rights.\n(d) use the Services in violation of any applicable laws and/or to encourage illegal activities.\n(e) attempt (or encourage or support anyone else's attempt) to circumvent, reverse engineer, decrypt or otherwise alter or interfere with the Services or make any unauthorized use thereof.\n(f) access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Services, CDS\u2019 computer systems, or the technical delivery systems of CDS\u2019 providers or otherwise obtain or attempt to obtain any content, materials or information through any means not intentionally made publicly available or provided for through the Services.\n(g) probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network or breach or circumvent any security or authentication measures or otherwise attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Services through hacking, password mining or any other means.\n(h) use or attempt to use any \u201cspider\u201d, \u201crobot\u201d, \u201cbot\u201d, \u201cscraper\u201d, \u201cdata miner\u201d or any other program, device or algorithm, process or methodology to access, acquire, copy, or monitor the Services (or portions thereof).\n(i) forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or posting, or in any way use the Services to send altered, deceptive or false source-identifying information.\n(j) interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the access of any user, host or network, including, without limitation, sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Services, or by taking any action that would interfere with or create an undue burden on the Services.\nor (k) use the Services in any way that might bring CDS into disrepute.\n</p>\n<p>\nAny commercial or promotional distribution, publishing or exploitation of the Services is strictly prohibited unless you have received the express prior written permission from authorized personnel of CDS, CDS\u2019 licensors or the otherwise applicable rights holders.\n</p> 7.\nChanges to and Termination of the Services <p>\nWe aim to continually improve the delivery and content of the Services and, as a result, CDS will make changes to the Services from time to time.\nNew features may be added, but we also may modify or discontinue (temporarily or permanently) any element of the Services, in whole or in part.\nWe will notify you if there are any material changes to the Services either via an email to the email associated with your account or via a notice displayed in the Zotero software or on the Site.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere are some circumstances under which the Services may be terminated:\n</p>\n<p>\nA.\nIn the event that we cannot obtain commercially-practical rates or terms from a service provider or supplier, we may cease to offer the Services.\nIn such case, we will provide thirty-days prior notice via email to the email associated with your account or via a notice displayed in the Zotero software or on the Site.\n</p>\n<p>\nB.\nWe may also cease to offer the Services for any other reason, in which case we will provide you with a thirty-days prior notice via email to the email associated with your account or via a notice displayed in the Zotero software or on the Site.\nIn such case, we will not charge you for Services after their termination, and will refund you any fees paid in advance for Services that have not been received.\n</p>\n<p>\nCDS reserves the right, at any time, to disable the Services temporarily for security or maintenance reasons.\n</p> 8.\nPrivacy <p>\nAs a non-profit enterprise intended to support the development and use of open source scholarship and cultural collaboration, CDS takes privacy very seriously.\nIn order for you to access certain areas and functions/features of the Site and register with CDS (become a Registered User), we may ask you to establish certain login information and provide us with information that personally identifies you, such as your name and email address (\u201cPersonal Information\u201d).\nIf you communicate with us by email or otherwise complete online forms or the like, any information provided in such communication may be collected as Personal Information.\nThe information collection and use policies of CDS with respect to the privacy of such Personal Information are set forth in the Site's Privacy Policy, which is located at https://www.zotero.org/support/terms/privacy_policy and incorporated herein by reference.\n</p> 9.\nCopyright <p>\nYou may access third-party content in your use of the Services.\nYou may not remove any third party's copyright notices or other identifier, except as allowed by the third-party's license of that content.\nCDS is not responsible for any content provided by any third party.\n</p>\n<p>\nAll Submissions and other data and content made available through the Services must comply with U.S.\ncopyright law.\nPursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C.\n\u00a7512, as amended), if you believe in good faith that copyrighted work has been copied, adapted, reproduced or exhibited on the Site or through use of the Services in a manner that constitutes copyright infringement, you may submit written notification of the claimed infringing activity to our Designated Agent, Alex H.\nPyle, Sheehan Phinney Bass + Green PA, 255 State Street,
