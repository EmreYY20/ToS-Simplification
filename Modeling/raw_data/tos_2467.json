easy, FAQ format.\n<p>We understand that everyone thinks that privacy policies are long, complicated and difficult to understand.\nSo we're going to try to make this as simple as possible.</p>\n<strong>DEFINITIONS</strong>\n<p>Let's start with what we mean when we say:</p>\n<p>Aggregate Information: Information that we combine into anonymous groups of customers or users.\nOne way to think of it is in terms of a survey or opinion poll.\nAggregate information would tell you that 80 percent of the people voted for a candidate, but not who actually voted.\nThese groups are large enough to reasonably prevent individuals from being identified.</p>\n<p>Anonymous Information: Information that doesn't directly identify and can't reasonably be used to identify an individual customer or user.</p>\n<p>Customer: Anyone who purchases or uses our products or services.\nWhen a customer purchases retail products or services for use by others, those individuals also are customers.</p>\n<p>Mobile Application: A software application that runs on smartphones, tablet computers or other mobile devices and that allows users to access a variety of services and information.</p>\n<p>Personal Information: Information that directly identifies or reasonably can be used to figure out the identity of a customer or user, such as your name, address, phone number and email address.</p>\n<p>Relevant Advertising: Uses aggregate information about groups of people (like age, ethnicity, income range, where those groups live and work, and their interests) to develop advertising that is more likely to be useful to that group.\nIt does not use individual data about what a specific person might like.\n\"Online behavioral advertising\" is one type of relevant advertising.\nIt uses interest categories based on the websites visited by groups of people to deliver advertising online.</p>\n<p>User: Anyone who visits our websites or uses our mobile applications.</p>\n<p>Website: And other terms like \"Internet site,\" \"site\" and \"web page\" all mean the same thing, namely any page or location on the Internet, no matter what device (cell phone, tablet, laptop, PC, etc.) or protocol (http, WAP, ftp or other) is used to access the page or location.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THIS POLICY 1.\nWhat does this Policy cover? <p>This Privacy Policy covers our practices regarding the information we collect about our customers and users (how we collect it and how we use it).\nUse of our products and services, as well as visits to our websites, are subject to this Privacy Policy.</p> 2.\nWhat about my family members and other users of my Cricket account? Does this Policy apply to them? <p>Yes.\nYou're responsible for making sure all family members or other users under your account understand and agree to this Policy.\nGet everyone together and talk about it.\nOr, send it by email to make sure they're on board.\nHang it on the fridge.\nUp to you, just share&nbsp;it!</p> 3.\nWhen is your information not covered by this Policy? <p>Any time you give information to companies other than Cricket.\nSome examples are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you download applications or make purchases from other companies while using our wireless services;</li>\n<li>When you go to a non-Cricket website from one of our websites or applications (by clicking on a link or an advertisement, for example);</li>\n<li>When you give your information to another company through a website co-branded by Cricket but controlled by the other company;</li>\n<li>If you use public forums such as social networking services, Internet bulletin boards, chat rooms, or blogs, the information is publicly available, and we cannot prevent distribution and use of that information by other parties;</li>\n<li>Information about your location, usage and the numbers you dial when you're out and about and roaming on the network of another company;</li>\n<li>When you purchase or use non-Cricket products (such as wireless devices, internet browsers and mobile applications) in combination with Cricket services;</li>\n<li>When we license our brand to other companies for their use in marketing and selling certain non-Cricket products and services, information you give those companies is not covered by this Policy.</li>\n<li>We encourage you to consult the company's privacy policy to ensure that you understand how it intends to use your information and how you may exercise choices and control over it.</li>\n</ul> 4.\nCan my information be covered by this policy and other privacy policies at the same time? <p>Yes, that can happen.\nFor example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sometimes we will provide a service with other companies.\nIn that case your information may be subject to this Policy and that of the other companies.</li>\n<li>If you purchase one of our products or services from a retail store, any information you provide to them may be subject to both their policy and ours.</li>\n<li>We think it's a great idea to take a look at the privacy policies of any companies you do business with to learn how they use your information.</li>\n</ul> 5.\nWhat about business customers? <p>We may have written product or service agreements with business customers that contain specific provisions about confidentiality, security or handling of information.\nWhen one of these agreements differs from or conflicts with this Policy, the terms of those agreements will apply.\nIn all other instances, the terms of this Policy apply.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> QUESTIONS ABOUT THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT, HOW WE COLLECT IT AND HOW WE USE IT 1.\nWhat information do we collect?

<p>We may share your Personal Information with AT&amp;T and other AT&amp;T affiliates, including but not limited to Xandr and Warner Media, for a variety of purposes, including so that they can market products and services to you.\nExcept for AT&amp;T and other AT&amp;T affiliates, we will not share your Personal Information with other companies for them to use for the marketing of their own products and services without your consent.</p> 2.\nAre there any other times when you might provide my Personal Information to other companies or entities? <p>Yes.\nWe share your Personal Information with companies that perform services for us, like processing your bill.\nBecause we take our responsibility to safeguard your Personal Information seriously, we do not allow those companies to use it for any purpose other than to perform those services, and we require them to protect it in a way consistent with this Policy.</p>\n<p>Companies that perform these services may be located outside the United States or the jurisdiction where you reside.\nData we collect may be processed and stored in the United States or in other countries where we or our affiliates or service providers process data.\nIf your Personal Information is shared with these companies, it could be accessible to government authorities according to the laws that govern those jurisdictions, where information protection standards may differ.\nWhen we transfer personal data to other countries, we use a variety of legal mechanisms to help ensure all applicable laws, rights and regulations continue to protect your data.</p>\n<p>There are also occasions when we provide Personal Information to other companies or other entities, such as government agencies, credit bureaus and collection agencies, without your consent.\nSome examples include sharing to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Respond to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements;</li>\n<li>Comply with court orders, subpoenas, lawful discovery requests and other legal or regulatory requirements, and to enforce our legal rights or defend against legal claims;</li>\n<li>Obtain payment or make refunds for products and services that appear on your Cricket billing statements;</li>\n<li>Enforce our agreements and protect our rights or property;</li>\n<li>Assist with identity verification and email address validation;</li>\n<li>Notify, respond or provide information (including location information) to a responsible governmental entity in emergency or exigent circumstances or in situations involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury.\nand</li>\n<li>Notify the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children of information concerning child pornography of which we become aware through the provision of our services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> QUESTIONS ABOUT MY INFORMATION &amp.\nADVERTISING 1.\nDo you use my information to send me advertising? <p>Yes.\nWe may use information like the preferences you have expressed and interests you have demonstrated on our websites, in our stores, and through use of our products and services, to provide you with marketing information and advertisements for Cricket products and services.\nThose ads may be delivered on our websites and mobile applications.\nThis is called \"first party\" advertising.\nIt is part of our service relationship and you are not able to opt-out from this type of advertising.<br>\n<br>\nWe and our service providers and affiliates may collect and store information about your interactions with unaffiliated websites and applications that use our technologies, including cookies and similar tracking technologies.\nThis allows us to infer the presence of a common user or household behind multiple devices or browsers.&nbsp.\nWe do so in order to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Detect and prevent fraud;</li>\n<li>Attribution.\nand/or</li>\n<li>Tracking how well a marketing campaign performs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our advertising partners may also use anonymous information gathered through cookies and similar technologies, as well as other anonymous and aggregate information that either of us may have to help us tailor the ads you see on non-Cricket sites.\nFor example, if you see an ad from us on a non-Cricket sports-related website, you may later receive an ad for sporting equipment delivered by us on a different website.\nThis is called \"online behavioral advertising\", which is a type of Relevant Advertising.<br>\n<br>\nFor information on your advertising choices and opt-out, please see the \u201cYour Choices and Controls\u201d section of this Privacy Notice.</p> 2.\nWhat are cookies, Flash cookies, Web beacons, widgets, and server log files, how do you use them, and can I limit the collection of data from my computer on web sites that use that information for advertising? <p>Let's start with what we mean when we use the word \"cookie\" and other related terms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cookies are small data files.\nWebsites place them in your browser to recognize your computer or mobile device when you return to that site.\nCookies are created to keep track of your movements within the site, help you resume where you left off, remember your registered username, preferences and other customizations.</li>\n<li>There are a couple of important things to remember about cookies: <ul>\n<li>Disabling cookies may prevent you from using specific features on some websites.\nYou'll need to perform the opt out procedure if you opt out of a program or service and then change computers or Web browsers, or clear or erase the digital \"cookie\" that lets us know you opted out.</li>\n<li>Local Storage Cookies.\nLocal Storage is a convenient, flexible, secure and faster way to store HTTP state data.\nIt is a method by which our web pages locally store named key/value pairs in a user's web browser.\nLocal storage on ATT.com is mainly used to store and retrieve data in HTML pages from our domains.\nLocal storage data is session-based and will not persist once the session is over and the browser is closed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Flash Cookies (also called Local Shared Objects or \"LSOs\") are data files similar to cookies, except that they can store more complex data.\nThey can be used to remember your settings, preferences and usage, and other similar services.\nFlash cookies allow functionality and availability of certain services.\nIf disabled, these services may not function correctly.\nWhile browser cookies may be removed or blocked via web browser settings, flash cookies operate differently.\nPlease note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications.\nTo learn more about how to manage flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe website and make changes at Global Storage Settings Panel (http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html).</li>\n<li>Web beacons are small graphic images on a Web page or in an email.\nThey can be used for things like recording the pages and advertisements that users click on, or tracking how well an e-mail marketing campaign performs.</li>\n<li>A widget is a small program or application that can be embedded in a web page.\nIt can provide real-time information, such as stock quotes or weather reports.\nWidgets are often provided by a third party and allow them to collect data about users viewing that page.</li>\n<li>A server log records your web activity by your computer or mobile device and plays a key role in improving web page performance and introducing new features.\nFor example, it may record which search terms you've entered, or the links you've clicked on.\nIt may also record your browser information, such as your IP address, device type, how long you spend on a Web page, and your browser's cookies.</li>\n<li>Some websites have \"social network or other third-party plug-ins.\" These plug-ins may provide information back to those sites, even if you don't click on or interact with the plug-in.\nIt may also apply even if you don't have an account with them.\nSocial networks or third parties may use an identifier when transmitting from your browser.\nThis might include information about your browser type, operating system, device type, IP address and the URL of the web page where the plug-in appears.\nIf you use social networking tools or sites, we recommend you take a moment to familiarize yourself with their privacy policies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Managing Cookies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Most browsers will allow you to delete, disable and choose what cookies can be placed on your computer.\nIf you want more information about controlling cookies, visit http://www.AboutCookies.org.</p>\n<p>To learn how to manage cookies for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Individual Browsers&nbsp.\n<ul>\n<li>Internet Explorer&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Internet Explorer (Mobile devices)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Safari&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Safari Mobile (iPhones and iPads)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Firefox&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Firefox (Mobile devices)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Chrome&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Chrome (Mobile devices)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Flash Player <ul>\n<li>http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/<br> &nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul> 3.\nDo you use my information for other types of Relevant Advertising? <p>Yes.\nCricket also uses information we get through your use of our products and services, from our advertising partners, and information like your age and gender to deliver Relevant Advertising that is not online behavioral advertising.\nWe combine your anonymous information with that of other users into aggregate \"audience segments.\"&nbsp;These segments are based on particular interests and/or factual characteristics that everyone in that audience segment is likely to share.\nWe might use that information to send you advertisements that are relevant to those interests or characteristics.</p>\n<p>We are careful to create Relevant Advertising with aggregate audience segments that are large enough that you can't be identified individually.</p> 4.\nDo you use the location of my device for advertising purposes? <p>Yes.\nCricket uses information about the locations you visit in order to create combined wireless location interest characteristics that can be used to provide Relevant Advertising to you and others like you.</p>\n<p>Location characteristics are types of locations like \"movie theaters.\"&nbsp;People who live in or are associated with a particular geographic area (a city, ZIP-code or ZIP+ 4 code, for example) might appear to have a high interest in movies, thanks to collective information that shows wireless devices from that area are often located in the vicinity of movie theaters.\nWe might create a \"movies characteristic,\"&nbsp;and deliver movie ads to the people who live in or are associated with that area.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We may associate your wireless device with a particular geographic area, such as a city, ZIP-code, or ZIP + 4 code, based on your billing address or the cell towers you connect with most frequently.\nCricket does not keep a record of the places you have visited.</p>\n<p>In addition to other privacy protections, the process we use to create our audience segment includes a requirement that the ZIP + 4 or other geographic area to which a wireless location is assigned must contain a minimum of 25 households.\nZIP + 4 codes with less than 25 households are combined with other ZIP + 4 codes to satisfy this requirement.</p> 5.\nWhat's in it for me? <p>Just like the name says, you get advertising that's more relevant to your interests.\nFor example, if a particular audience segment, like adults between the ages of 21 and 25 with a certain income range, has demonstrated a greater interest in movies than other segments, we might send them a movie ad for a movie geared toward young adults.\nThis is just one way we deliver content that's more relevant.\n&nbsp;</p> 6.\nDo I ever have a chance to tell you what I'm personally interested in? <p>When we add new offers that use your Personal Information to customize and deliver individually tailored advertising and promotions to you, we'll let you know, so you can decide if you'd like to participate.\nFor example, in the future we may offer you a service that allows you to sign up to receive text-message offers from business that are near your current location and match up to interests you select.\nOr we could offer you free or discounted services in exchange for the use of your Personal Information for advertising and other similar purposes.\nWe promise, before we use any of your Personal Information (including information we gather as an Internet service provider) for such purposes, we will always give you the opportunity to make an informed choice about whether to participate</p> 7.\nWhat information do you provide to advertisers? <p>Cricket may provide reports to advertisers and other business customers about the success of its advertising campaigns.\nThose reports contain aggregate information about the number of times a particular ad was viewed, when it was viewed, whether it was viewed on a mobile device or a computer, demographics associated with the viewing audience and other similar information.\nYour anonymous information will not be included in aggregate reports about the success of Relevant Advertising campaigns if you have opted-out of Relevant Advertising delivered by Cricket or its advertising partners.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> QUESTIONS ABOUT LOCATION INFORMATION 1.\nWhat is location information? <p>Exactly what it sounds like! It includes your ZIP-code and street address, as well as the whereabouts of your wireless device.</p> 2.\nHow is it used? <p>We use it in all kinds of ways, here are some examples:&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>We Provide Wireless Voice and Data Services:</strong> We monitor, collect and use wireless location information, together with other information we get from our network and your wireless device, to maintain and improve our network.\nWe also might use location information with your consent for advertising or to provide you with a customized experience.\nFor example, if we provide 411 Directory Assistance and you dial the telephone number for a particular business.\nwe might use your wireless location information to return the number of the business location closest to you.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Location Based Services (LBS):</strong> Your device can be used to access a ton of services based on location.\nWe offer these services via applications that have been pre-loaded or downloaded by you on your device.\nLBS also may be provided via text message or other functionality.\nWe'll give you prior notice and ask for your consent when your location is used or shared.\nThe form of consent may vary, but will be appropriate for the type of Cricket LBS you use.\nYou can disable location sharing for these applications in your device settings.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul> 3.\nHow accurate is wireless location information? <p>It depends on the technology we're using.\nFor example, we can locate your device based on the cell tower that's serving you.\nThe range could be up to 1,000 meters in any direction from the tower in urban areas, and up to 10,000 meters in rural areas.\nWi-Fi networks provide more accurate location information, associating you with the place where the network is located like a coffee shop or to an area within or around that place.</p>\n<p>Some services require more precise information.\nFor those, we develop a more precise estimate of location by associating the serving cell tower ID with other information, like the latitude and longitude of the tower, radio frequency parameters, GPS information and timing differences in radio signals.\nDepending on a variety of factors, those methods may estimate the location of your device to within 30 to 1000 meters.</p> 4.\nAre you the only ones who can locate my wireless device? &nbsp.\n<p>Other companies may also be able to locate your device.\nFor example, your handset manufacturer and your operating system provider may be able to locate your device.\nIf you download mobile applications, those apps may be able to obtain your location directly from your handset or the operating system.\nMobile applications that give you access to your employer's network, may also give your employer the ability to locate your device.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We urge you to review Policies of all providers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> QUESTIONS ABOUT AGGREGATE AND ANONYMOUS INFORMATION 1.\nWhere do you get anonymous information? <p>Sometimes we'll collect information about how you use our products using cookies and other similar technologies.\nThis information doesn't include your Personal Information and is considered anonymous.</p>\n<p>When we collect information that identifies you personally, we may anonymize it for certain purposes.\nWe remove data fields (such as name, address and telephone number) that can reasonably be used to identify you.\nWe also use a variety of statistical techniques and operational controls to anonymize data.\nAnonymizing information is one of the tools we use to protect your privacy.</p> 2.\nTell me more about aggregate information.\n<p>Aggregate information is a form of anonymous information.\nWe combine data that meet certain criteria into anonymous groups.\nFor example, we might want to compare how customers in Beverly Hills, CA (or any city, county or ZIP-code)&nbsp;use their cell phones to how customers in Boulder, CO&nbsp;use their cell phones.\nIn order to do that, we would combine customer data in each of the geographies into anonymous groups and look at all that aggregate data to understand how the two groups are different or similar.</p> 3.\nDo you share anonymous or aggregate information? <p>Yes, we may share this information with other companies and entities for specific uses, which may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Universities, laboratories, think tanks and other entities that conduct networking, social, behavioral, environmental and other types of scientific research, for the purpose of creating fundamental new knowledge;</li>\n<li>Municipalities, government or other entities that may use this data for purposes such as municipal and transportation planning, and emergency and disaster response coordination.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We share this information in external reports like our External Marketing and Analytics Reports and Metric Reports.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> QUESTIONS ABOUT EXTERNAL MARKETING AND ANALYTICS REPORTS 1.\nTell me more about the External Marketing &amp.\nAnalytics Program.\n<ul>\n<li>We use aggregate information to create External Marketing &amp.\nAnalytics Reports that we may sell to other companies for their own marketing, advertising or other similar uses.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;</li>\n<li>These reports may be a combination of information from wireless and Wi-Fi locations, website browsing and mobile application usage and other information we have about you and other customers.\nYou have a choice about whether your anonymous information is included in these reports.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some examples of External Marketing &amp.\nAnalytics Reports include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reports for retail businesses that show the number of wireless devices in or near their store locations by time of day and day of the week, together with demographic characteristics of the users (such as age and gender) in those groups.\nand&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Reports for device manufacturers that combine information such as device type, make and model with demographic and regional location information to reflect the popularity of particular device types with various customer segments.</li>\n</ul> 2.\nDo you provide companies with individual anonymous data as part of your External Marketing &amp.\nAnalytics Program? <p>Yes.\nWhen we provide individual anonymous information to businesses, we require that they only use it to provide aggregate reports, and for no other purpose.\nWe also require businesses to agree they will not attempt to identify any person using this information, and that they will handle it in a secure manner, consistent with this Policy.</p> 3.\nDo you use my anonymous information in other types of external reports? <p>We may use your anonymous information to provide Metrics Reports to our service suppliers.\nFor example, we may license entertainment content, like music programming, from content providers.\nOur agreements with those providers may require us to provide them with Metrics Reports containing measurements and other statistics about the number of customers who used particular content at a particular time and other similar information.\nThese reports are considered part of the underlying service and we do not sell them to other customers or suppliers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> OUR ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY FOR CHILDREN 1.\nDo you collect information about my children's use? <p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifying information from anyone under the age of 13.</p> 2.\nWhat happens when my child is using an account not registered to them? <p>Internet and wireless devices and services purchased for family use may be used by children without our knowledge.\nWhen that happens, information collected appears to us to be associated with the adult customer who subscribes to our services, and will be treated as the adult's information under this Policy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> QUESTIONS ABOUT DATA PROTECTION AND SECURITY 1.\nDo we sell your Personal Information? <p>We don't sell your Personal Information to anyone, for any purpose.\nPeriod.</p> 2.\nHow long do we keep your Personal Information? <p>We keep your Personal Information as long as we need for business, tax, or legal purposes.\nAfter that, we destroy it by making it unreadable or undecipherable</p> 3.\nWhat safeguards does Cricket have in place? <ul>\n<li>We've worked hard to protect your information.\nAnd we've established electronic and administrative safeguards designed to make the information we collect secure.\nSome examples of those safeguards include:</li>\n<li>All of our employees are subject to the Code of Business Conduct&nbsp;(COBC) and certain state-mandated codes of conduct.\nUnder the COBC, all employees must follow the laws, rules, regulations, court and/or administrative orders that apply to our business including, specifically, the legal requirements and company policies surrounding the privacy of communications and the security and privacy of your records.\nWe take this seriously, and any of our employees who fail to meet the standards we've set in the COBC are subject to disciplinary action.\nThat includes dismissal.</li>\n<li>We've implemented technology and security features and strict policy guidelines to safeguard the privacy of your Personal Information.\nSome examples are:&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Maintaining and protecting the security of computer storage and network equipment, and our security procedures require employee user names and passwords to access sensitive data;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Applying encryption or other appropriate security controls to protect Personal Information when stored or transmitted by us;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Limiting access to Personal Information to only those with jobs requiring such &nbsp;access.\nand&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Requiring caller/online authentication before providing Account Information so that only you or someone who knows your Account Information will be able to access or change the information.</li>\n<li>Although we strive to keep your Personal Information secure, no security measures are perfect, and we cannot guarantee that your Personal Information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Policy (for example, as the result of unauthorized acts by third parties that violate the law or this Policy).</li>\n</ul> 4.\nWill you notify me in case of a security breach? <p>Laws and regulations guide us in how to give you notification when certain types of sensitive information are involved in a security breach.\nWe will provide you with notice in accordance with these laws and regulations.</p> 5.\nCan I review, correct, update or remove my Personal Information and Deactivate my account? <p>Yes.\nWe are happy to help you review, correct, update, or remove the information associated with your account and billing records as appropriate.&nbsp;We may still retain your information in our files however, as required for various purposes including dispute resolution, enforcing user agreements and other business, technical or legal requirements.\nPlease login to your Cricket account for assistance.\nIf you need further assistance please contact us at privacypolicy@cricketwireless.com.\nWe will respond to all requests within a reasonable time.</p> &nbsp.\nQUESTIONS ABOUT FUTURE CHANGES 1.\nWhat happens if there is a change in corporate ownership? <p>Information about our customers and users, including Personal Information, may be shared and transferred as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider.\nThis also applies in the unlikely event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which customer and user records would be transferred to another entity as a result of such a proceeding.</p> 2.\nWill I be notified if there are changes to this policy? <p>We may update this Privacy Policy as necessary to reflect changes we make and to satisfy legal requirements.\nWe will post a prominent notice of the change on our websites.\nWe will provide you with other appropriate notice of important changes at least 30 days before the effective date.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> YOUR CHOICES &amp.\nCONTROLS 1.\nYou can choose not to receive some types of advertising online or on your wireless device.\n<ul>\n<li>Opt-out of all Relevant Advertising delivered on your mobile device&nbsp;here.\nYou'll need to opt-out on <strong>each</strong> mobile device you want to exclude.</li>\n<li>Opt-out of online behavioral advertising provided by Cricket and other advertisers by clicking the Advertising Choices link at the bottom of our web pages.</li>\n<li>Opt-out of online behavioral advertising from many other ad networks at the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) site.</li>\n<li>When you see online ads for Cricket products and services that display this icon , click and you will get information on how to opt-out.</li>\n</ul> 2.\nDo I have choices about receiving first party advertisements from Cricket?

affects your rights.\n</strong>\n<br>\n<strong>1.3.1 &nbsp;Summary</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nThis part of the Agreement outlines how disputes between you and Cricket will be resolved through our informal dispute resolution process, individual arbitration, or small claims court.\nThe informal dispute resolution process gives you the opportunity to explain what happened to someone in, or working with, our legal department.\nUnder the terms of this Agreement, Cricket is encouraged to resolve issues early, without going any further.<br>\n<br>\nAn \u201carbitration\u201d is a less formal alternative to a lawsuit or jury trial in court.\nA neutral third party, called an arbitrator, decides the dispute.\nThe arbitrator applies the same law and can award the same individualized remedies that a court could award but uses streamlined procedures and limits discovery to simplify the process and reduce costs.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision is legally binding, and it is subject to very limited review by courts.\n<strong>You and Cricket agree that</strong>\n<strong> arbitration will take place on an individual basis.\nClass arbitrations, class actions, and representative actions are not permitted.\nThis means that you and Cricket will neither file a lawsuit (in any court other than a small </strong>\n<strong>claims court), nor pursue or participate in an action seeking relief on behalf of others.\n</strong>\n<br>\n<em>While subsection 1.3.2 lays out the specifics, here are the steps you would take to resolve a dispute</em>:<br>\n<strong>Contact customer service.</strong> We encourage you to give customer service a call first.\nA phone call, chat session, or email with us is usually the quickest way to resolve an issue.\nCheck out https://www.cricketwireless.com/contactus to find the right service or product team for your issue.<br>\n<strong>You choose.\n</strong>If you aren\u2019t satisfied after talking to customer service, you can choose to file your individual claim in small claims court or send us a Notice of Dispute, which is required before starting arbitration.<br>\n<strong>Let\u2019s work it out.</strong> If you decide not to go to small claims court, start the informal dispute resolution process by sending a Notice of Dispute to our legal department, which you can complete and send at https://www.cricketwireless.com/legal-info/notice-of-dispute.html You and Cricket agree to give each other at least 60 days to share information and try to reach an agreement.\n(We\u2019ll use the same process if we have a dispute with you.) At your or our request, we\u2019ll schedule an Informal Settlement Conference to try to reach an agreement by phone or video-conference.<br>\n<strong>Pursue an arbitration.</strong> If the dispute still isn\u2019t resolved, you can pursue an individual arbitration.\nThe nation\u2019s largest non-profit arbitration provider, the American Arbitration Association (AAA), will administer the arbitration and select the neutral arbitrator, with input from both you and Cricket.\nSome things to keep in mind: <ul>\n<li>Cricket will usually pay all of the arbitration fees (with some exceptions).\n</li>\n<li>Any hearings will be in the same county as your billing address, or they might be held by phone or video-conference.\n</li>\n<li>In some cases, if you win, we will pay double attorney\u2019s fees (if any) and a minimum of $10,000.\n</li>\n</ul>\nThere are special rules for coordinated (or mass) arbitrations, where the same lawyers or a group of coordinated lawyers seek to file 25 or more similar arbitrations.\nIf you choose to be part of those proceedings, the cases will proceed in stages, so it might take longer to arbitrate your dispute than it would otherwise.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>1.3.2&nbsp.\nArbitration Agreement<u>\n</u>\n</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>1.3.2.1 Claims Subject to Arbitration:</strong>\n<br>\nTo the greatest extent permitted by law, Cricket and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between you and Cricket, except for claims arising from bodily injury or death.\nThis arbitration provision is intended to be broadly interpreted.\nIt includes, but is not limited to: <ul>\n<li>claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other statutory or common-law legal theory;</li>\n<li>claims that arose before the existence of this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);&nbsp;</li>\n<li>claims for mental or emotional distress or injury not arising out of bodily injury;</li>\n<li>claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class.\nand</li>\n<li>claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</li>\n</ul>\nReferences in Section 1.3 to \u201cCricket\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d include our past, present, and future parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and related entities, as well as Cricket\u2019s and all of those entities\u2019 officers, agents, employees, licensors, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns.\nReferences in Section 1.3 to \u201cyou\u201d include your past, present, and future parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, related entities, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns.\nand all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of Cricket Services or products under past, present, or future Agreements between you and Cricket.<br>\n<strong>Small Claims Option.</strong> Despite this arbitration provision, either you or Cricket may bring an action seeking only individualized relief in the small claims court for the county (or parish) of your billing address, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction.<br>\nThis arbitration provision does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Communications Commission.\nThose agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.&nbsp;<strong>By entering into this Agreement, you and Cricket are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</strong>&nbsp;This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of this Agreement.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>1.3.2.2 Pre-Arbitration Informal Dispute Resolution Process</strong>\n<br>\nCustomer service is available to help and usually can resolve any concerns you may have.\nIf that does not work, the first step in the dispute resolution process is to send a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d).\n(We\u2019ll also send you a Notice to your billing address if we have a dispute with you.) You may download the Notice form at https://www.cricketwireless.com/entassets/Cricket_Wireless_Arbitration_Form.pdf.\nThe Notice to Cricket may be sent by U.S.\nmail or professional courier service to Legal Department - Notice of Dispute, Cricket, 208 S.\nAkard, Office #2900.13, Dallas, Texas 75202 (the \"Notice Address\"), or, alternatively, submitted electronically by following the instructions at https://www.cricketwireless.com/legal-info/notice-of-dispute.html.\nThe Notice must include all of the information requested on the Notice form, including: (a) the claimant\u2019s name, address, and phone number.\n(b) the Account number at issue.\n(c) the services (if any) to which the claim pertains.\n(d) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (e) an explanation of the specific relief sought and the basis for the calculations.\nThe Notice must be personally signed by you (if you are the claimant) or by a Cricket representative (if we are the claimant).\nTo safeguard your Account, you might be required to provide both your authentication and consent for us to discuss your Account or share your Account information with anyone but you, including an attorney (\u201cAuthentication and Consent\u201d).<u>\n</u>\n<br>\nWhoever sends the Notice must give the other party 60 days after receipt of a complete Notice (including your Authentication and Consent, if required) to investigate the claim.\nDuring that period, either you or Cricket may request an individualized discussion (by phone call or video-conference) regarding settlement (\u201cInformal Settlement Conference\u201d).\nYou and Cricket must work together in good faith to select a mutually agreeable time for the Informal Settlement Conference (which can be after the 60-day period).\nYou and a Cricket representative must personally participate, unless otherwise agreed in writing.\nYour and Cricket\u2019s lawyers (if any) also can participate.<br>\n<strong>Any applicable statute of limitations or contractual limitations period will be tolled </strong>for the claims and requested relief in the Notice during the \u201cInformal Resolution Period.\u201d The Informal Resolution Period is the number of days between the date that the complete Notice (and Authentication and Consent, if required) is received by the other party, and the later of (1) 60 days later or (2) the date the Informal Settlement Conference is completed, if timely requested.<br>\nAny arbitration proceeding cannot be commenced until after the Informal Resolution Period has ended.\n(Subsection 1.3.2.7 contains additional requirements for commencing certain coordinated arbitrations.) All of the pre-arbitration dispute resolution requirements are essential so that you and Cricket have a meaningful chance to resolve disputes informally.\nIf any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court can enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration.\nIn addition, unless prohibited by law, the AAA may not accept, administer, assess, or demand fees in connection with such an arbitration.\nIf the arbitration already is pending, it must be dismissed.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>1.3.2.3 Arbitration Procedure</strong>\n<br>\nYou may download a form to initiate arbitration at https://www.cricketwireless.com/legal-info/arbitration.html.\nIn addition, information on how to commence an arbitration proceeding, including how to file a consumer arbitration online, is at adr.org/support.\nA copy of the arbitration demand must be sent to AAA and the Notice Address, and a copy of the Notice must be attached to your arbitration demand.<br>\nThe arbitration will be governed by the then-current Consumer Arbitration Rules (\u201cAAA Rules\u201d) of the AAA, as modified by this arbitration provision, and will be administered by AAA.\n(If AAA refuses to enforce any part of this arbitration provision, you and Cricket will select another arbitration provider.\nIf there is no agreement, the court will do so.) The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org or may be requested by writing to the Notice Address.\n(You may obtain information that is designed for non-lawyers about the arbitration process at https://www.cricketwireless.com/legal-info/arbitration.html.)<br>\nAs in court, you and Cricket agree that any counsel representing someone in arbitration certifies that they\u2019re complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including a certification that the claim or the relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose.\nThe arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions available under AAA Rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or applicable federal or state law against all appropriate represented parties and counsel.<br>\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except only a court can decide the following: <ul>\n<li>issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision,</li>\n<li>whether a dispute can or must be brought in arbitration,</li>\n<li>whether the AAA cannot or will not administer the arbitration in accordance with this arbitration provision,</li>\n<li>whether subsection 1.3.2.2 has been complied with or violated for purposes of awarding relief under that subsection that a court can award, and</li>\n<li>whether subsections 1.3.2.6, 1.3.2.7, or 1.3.2.8 have been complied with or violated.</li>\n</ul>\nThe arbitrator may consider rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers, but an arbitrator\u2019s ruling will not be binding in proceedings involving different customers.<br>\nUnless you and Cricket agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address.\nIf your claim is valued at $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator or through a telephonic, video-conference, or in-person hearing under AAA Rules.\nIf your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by AAA Rules.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offers must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the relief, if any, to which you or Cricket is entitled.\nRegardless of how the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which his or her decision is based.\nExcept as provided in subsection 1.3.2.6 below, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief that a court can award under applicable law.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>1.3.2.4 Arbitration Fees</strong>\n<br>\nWe will pay all AAA filing, administration, case-management, hearing, and arbitrator fees if we initiate an arbitration.\nIf you initiate arbitration of claims valued at $75,000 or less, we will pay those fees, so long as you have fully complied with the requirements in subsection 1.3.2.2.\nIn such cases, we will pay the filing fee directly to AAA upon receiving a written request from you at the Notice Address or, if AAA requires you to pay the filing fee to commence arbitration, we will send that amount to AAA and request that AAA reimburse you.\nIf, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the allocation and payment of all such fees will be governed by AAA Rules.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>1.3.2.5 Alternative Payment and Attorney Premium</strong>\n<br>\nIf you fully complied with the requirements above in subsection 1.3.2.2 and the arbitrator issues an award in your favor that is greater than the value of our last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was selected, then we will: <ul>\n<li>pay you the amount of the award or $10,000 (the \"Alternative Payment\u201d), whichever is greater.\nand</li>\n<li>pay the attorney you retained, if any, twice the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably incurs for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (the \u201cAttorney Premium\u201d).</li>\n</ul>\nIf we did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before the arbitrator was selected, and the arbitrator awards you any relief on the merits, you and your attorney will be entitled to receive the Alternative Payment and the Attorney Premium, respectively.<br>\nDisputes regarding the payment and reimbursement of attorneys\u2019 fees, expenses, the Alternative Payment, and the Attorney Premium may be resolved by the arbitrator upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits.\nIn assessing whether an award that includes attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses is greater than the value of our last written settlement offer, the calculation will include only the reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses you incurred pursuing this arbitration through the date of our settlement offer.<br>\nThe right to the Attorney Premium supplements any right to attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses you may have under applicable law.\nThus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this arbitration provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount.\nHowever, you may not recover both the Attorney Premium and a duplicative award of attorneys\u2019 fees or expenses.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>1.3.2.6 Requirement of Individual Arbitration</strong>\n<br>\nThe arbitrator may award relief (including, but not limited to, damages, restitution, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim.\nYOU AND CRICKET AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING.\nFurther, unless both you and Cricket agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s or entity\u2019s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, class, private attorney general, or public injunction proceeding.\n&nbsp;<br>\nIf a court (after exhaustion of all appeals) declares unenforceable any of these prohibitions on consolidation or non-individualized relief (such as class, representative, private attorney general, or public injunctive relief), then all other aspects of the case must be arbitrated first.\nAfter completing arbitration, the remaining (non-arbitrable) aspects of the case will then be decided by a court.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>1.3.2.7 Administration of Coordinated Arbitrations</strong>\n<br>\nIf 25 or more claimants submit Notices or seek to file arbitrations raising similar claims and are represented by the same or coordinated counsel (whether such cases are pursued simultaneously or not), all the cases must be resolved in staged proceedings.\n<strong>You agree to this process even though it may delay the arbitration of your claim.</strong> In the first stage, claimants\u2019 counsel and Cricket will each select 25 cases (50 cases total) to be filed in arbitration and resolved individually by different arbitrators.\nIf feasible, the arbitrators will be from the respective claimants\u2019 home states.\nIf there are fewer than 50 cases, all will be filed in arbitration.\nIn the meantime, no other cases may be filed or proceed in arbitration, and the AAA must not assess or demand payment of fees for the remaining cases or administer or accept them.<br>\nThe arbitrators are encouraged to resolve the cases within 120 days of appointment or as swiftly as possible thereafter, consistent with fairness to the parties.\nAfter the first stage is completed, the parties must engage in a single mediation of all remaining cases, and Cricket will pay the mediation fee.\nIf the parties cannot agree how to resolve the remaining cases after mediation, they will repeat the process of selecting and filing 50 cases to be resolved individually by different arbitrators, followed by mediation.<br>\nIf any claims remain after the second stage, the process will be repeated until all claims are resolved, with four differences.\nFirst, a total of 100 cases may be filed in the third and later stages.\nSecond, the cases will be randomly selected.\nThird, arbitrators who decided cases in the first two stages may be appointed in later stages if different arbitrators are not available.\nFourth, mediation is optional at the election of counsel for the claimants.<br>\nBetween stages, counsel will meet and confer regarding ways to improve the efficiency of the staged proceedings, including whether to increase the number of cases filed in each stage.\nEither party may also negotiate with AAA regarding the amount or timing of AAA fees.<br>\nIf this subsection applies to a Notice, the Informal Resolution Period for the claims and relief set forth in that Notice will be extended (including the tolling of

notice.\nand/or</li>\n<li>blocking access to certain categories of numbers (e.g., 976, 900, and international destinations) at our sole discretion.\n<br> &nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>2.5.1&nbsp.\nExamples of Prohibited Network Uses of Voice Service</strong>\n<br>\nOur unlimited Voice Service is provided primarily for live dialogue between individuals.\nIf your use of unlimited Voice Service for call forwarding, conference calling or purposes other than live dialogue between individuals exceeds 1,000 minutes per month, Cricket may terminate your Service or change you to a Service Plan with no unlimited voice usage components.\nOur unlimited Voice Service may not be used for any other commercial purposes, including, but not limited to: (1) maintaining an open line to provide dispatch or monitoring services.\n(2) accessing or remote call forwarding to multi-party chat line services.\n(3) transmitting broadcasts or pre-recorded materials.\nor (4) telemarketing.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>2.5.2&nbsp.\nExamples of Prohibited Network Uses of Messaging Service</strong>\n<br>\nOur Messaging Services are provided solely for communication between, and/or initiated by, individuals for personal use.\nYou may not use Messaging Services for commercial purposes, including, but not limited to: (1) sending unsolicited, unauthorized, spam, or other unwanted messages (whether SMS, MMS, RCS, or other).\n(2) sending or receiving unusually high numbers of messages or messages not originated on your Device.\nor (3) reselling or transferring messaging capabilities.\nSee the Acceptable Use Policy (located at www.cricketwireless.com/aup) for more information.\n&nbsp;We may terminate or restrict your Messaging Service for tethered messaging, excessive use, or misuse.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>2.5.3&nbsp.\nExamples of Prohibited Network Uses of Data Service</strong>\n<br>\nData Service may <u>not</u> be used in any manner that: defeats, obstructs, penetrates, or attempts to defeat, obstruct, or penetrate, the security measures of Cricket\u2019s wireless network or systems, or another entity\u2019s network or systems.\naccesses, or attempts to access without authority, the accounts of others.\nor adversely affects the ability of other people or systems to use either Cricket\u2019s Wireless Services or other parties\u2019 internet-based resources.\nFor example, this prohibition includes, but is not limited to: malicious software or \u201cmalware\u201d that is designed, intentionally or unintentionally, to infiltrate a network or computer system such as spyware, worms, Trojan horses, rootkits, and/or crimeware.\n\u201cdenial of service\u201d attacks against a network host or individual user.\nand \u201cspam\u201d or unsolicited commercial or bulk email (or activities that have the effect of facilitating unsolicited commercial or bulk email).<br>\nData Service may not be used in any manner that has the effect of excessively contributing to network congestion, hindering other customers\u2019 access to the network, or degrading network performance.\nFor example, this includes, but is not limited to: server devices or host computer applications such as continuous Web camera posts or broadcasts, automatic data feeds, or automated machine-to-machine connections.\n\u201cauto-responders,\u201d \u201ccancel bots,\u201d or similar automated or manual routines that generate excessive amounts of traffic or that disrupt user groups or email use by others.\nuse of the Wireless Service as a substitute or backup for private lines or full-time or dedicated data connections.\npeer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing services.\nand software or other devices that maintain continuous active internet connections when a connection would otherwise be idle or any \u201ckeep alive\u201d functions.<br>\nData Service also may <em>not </em>be used with high bandwidth applications, services and content that are not optimized to work with Data Service and, therefore disproportionately and excessively contribute to network congestion.\nThis includes, but is not limited to, redirecting television signals for viewing on computing devices.\nweb broadcasting.\nand/or the operation of servers, telemetry devices, or supervisory control and data acquisition devices.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>2.6 Unlimited Data Service</strong>\n<br>\nIf you are subscribed to a Cricket unlimited data plan, you agree that \u201cunlimited\u201d means you pay a single monthly flat rate for wireless Data Service regardless of how much data you use.\nYou further agree that \u201cunlimited\u201d does not mean that wireless data will be transmitted at any particular speed or that you can use Cricket\u2019s wireless Data Service in any way that you choose or for any Prohibited Network Uses.\nIf you use your unlimited data plan in any manner that is prohibited, Cricket can limit, restrict, suspend or terminate your Data Service.\nWe may also migrate you from the unlimited data plan to a tiered data plan and charge you the appropriate monthly fees.\nWe will provide you with notice of this change at least 30 days in advance either by email, text message, or other appropriate means.<br>\nCricket may also reduce your data throughput speeds at any time based on the terms of your data plan, which may include times when your usage exceeds an applicable, identified data usage threshold during any monthly service period.&nbsp;Reduced data throughput speeds mean you may experience reduced data speeds and increased latency, which may cause websites to load more slowly and affect the performance of data-heavy activities such as video streaming.<br>\nReduced data throughput speeds apply when using Data Services at times and in areas experiencing network congestion compared to other customers using the same cell site.\nStandard speeds will resume once the cell site is no longer congested or when your data session moves to an uncongested cell site, and speeds will no longer be reduced during periods of network congestion at the start of your next monthly service period, unless your usage again exceeds an applicable, identified data usage threshold for that next monthly service period.<br>\nThere are no mobile network-related speed reductions if you use Wi-Fi, and Wi-Fi data usage does not count against a monthly data usage threshold for wireless Data service.\nFor more information, go to www.cricketwireless.com/mobilebroadband.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>2.7&nbsp.\nCricket\u2019s Rights to Change, Reduce, Cancel, Suspend, Interrupt or Terminate Wireless Service or the Agreement<u>\n</u>\n</strong>\n<br>\nCricket can take any and all actions necessary to protect the Cricket wireless network, ensure compliance with this Agreement and prevent and/or stop Prohibited Network Uses.\nCricket may also change, reduce, interrupt, suspend, limit or cancel your Wireless Service or terminate your Agreement without advance notice for any reason, including, but not limited to the following actions by you or any user of your Device or on your Account:\n<ul>\n<li>misconduct described by subsection 1.5;</li>\n<li>living or predominantly using Wireless Service outside of the Cricket, and/or Cricket affiliate, owned and operated domestic network coverage area;</li>\n<li>exceeding our off-net roaming usage allowances.\nand</li>\n<li>engaging or attempting to engage in Prohibited Network Uses.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nIf you lose your eligibility for a particular Wireless Service, we may modify, remove, or change your Wireless Service to one for which you qualify.\n<strong>If we determine that you are using your Device without the correct rate plan, we reserve the right to switch you to the required rate plan and charge you the appropriate monthly charges and fees.\n</strong>If we change your rate plan, you may change to another eligible rate plan.\nWe may engage in any reasonable network management practice to enhance customer service, to reduce network congestion, to adapt to advances and changes in technology, and/or to respond to the limited availability of wireless bandwidth and spectrum<strong>.\n</strong>We may reduce your data throughput speeds at any time or place according to your rate plan.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>2.8&nbsp.\nUse of Wireless Service on Other Wireless Carrier Networks<u>\n</u>\n</strong>\n<br>\nCricket has agreements with other wireless carriers that allow you to use Wireless Service outside of Cricket\u2019s, or Cricket affiliates\u2019, owned and operated wireless network.\nWithin the U.S.\nand certain U.S.\nterritories, the use of other carrier networks is referred to as domestic off-net usage.\nUse of other carrier networks while traveling internationally is called international roaming or international off-net usage.\nBoth off-net usage and international roaming are dependent upon the agreements we have at any given time with other wireless carriers, and the network technology, frequencies, and functionality of those networks.\nAvailability, quality of coverage, and speed for Wireless Service for off-net usage and international roaming are not guaranteed and may be changed without notice.\nCricket may also reduce speeds (to 2G or other speeds) or suspend wireless Data Service for off-net and international roaming at any time without notice and without regard to the amount of data you have consumed during the monthly service period.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>2.8.1&nbsp.\nLimits on Use of Other Wireless Carrier Networks in the U.S.: </strong>\n<br>\nIn most cases you are not charged separately for domestic off-net usage.\nPlease check your rate plan terms to determine whether any extra charges apply for domestic roaming.\nHowever, if your rate plan provides for off-net usage, you still must use your Device predominantly within the Cricket, or Cricket affiliate, owned and operated wireless network.\nThus, if we provide you with off-net usage, we may suspend, limit or cancel your continued use of other carriers' networks if you exceed the following off-net thresholds:<strong>\n</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Voice:</strong> If you use more than 750 minutes during any month.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Data:</strong> If you use more than 100 megabytes of data during any month.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Messaging: </strong>If you use more than 3,000 messages during any

Does Cricket provide any tools to help customers monitor and control their data usage?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We have developed data plans for our mobile broadband Internet access services so that our customers can choose from a variety of rate plans that best reflect their own usage levels.\nCustomers can monitor and control their data usage through the online View Data Usage tool at My Account (www.cricketwireless.com/myaccount) and through the myCricket app.</p>\n<p>Our current monthly phone service plans offer a fixed amount of high-speed data access with no overage charges: $30 (5&nbsp;GB) and $40 (10 GB).\nCricket's $60 Cricket More Plan and $55 Cricket Core Plan provide unlimited high-speed data access.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Except for the Cricket More plan, Cricket may temporarily slow data speeds if the network is busy.</p>\n<p>\"Unlimited\" with regard to data is referring to the quantity of data a subscriber can consume, subject to these terms and conditions, and does not refer to the speed at which data will be transmitted.</p>\n<p>For those phone service&nbsp;plans with a limited amount of high-speed data access, we've developed a process to reduce the customer's data download throughput speed once the customer exceeds the high-speed data access usage threshold for the customer's plan.\nIn that situation, the customer may continue to consume data at no extra charge, but at significantly lower speeds when connected to the cellular network.\nSpecifically, after a customer uses their available high-speed data allotment in a month of service, the customer's service over the cellular network will transmit data at a maximum of 128kbps for the remainder of the monthly plan cycle unless the customer purchases additional high-speed data access for the remainder of the month of service.\nOnce a customer's speeds are limited, the customer's connection over the cellular network should still allow viewing a web page or checking email.\nBandwidth-intensive activities, including audio and video streaming, picture and video messaging, select apps and services, as well as other usage will be impacted and may not be fully functional.\nUsing Wi-Fi can help avoid reduced speeds.\nSpeeds are not reduced while connected via Wi-Fi, and data activity over Wi-Fi does not count toward the high-speed data usage threshold.</p>\n<p>We will notify customers during each monthly plan cycle when their data usage reaches 75% and 100% of their monthly high-speed data allotment so that they are aware of their amount of data usage and can make adjustments to avoid slower speeds.\nWhen connected to a Wi-Fi network, the customer's speed will not be impacted.<br>\n<br>\nCricket offers two data only plans with a fixed amount of high-speed data access with no overage charges: $35/ 20 GB and $50/ 40 GB.\nAfter all of the plan\u2019s high-speed data allotment is used, the customer will not have additional data access unless the customer purchases additional data access for the remainder of the month of service.\nWe will notify customers during each monthly plan cycle when their data usage reaches 75% and 100% of their monthly high-speed data allotment so they are aware of their amount of data usage and can make adjustments to avoid using all of their high-speed data allotment or can determine whether to purchase additional data during that monthly service period.<br>\n<br>\nExcept for the Cricket Core&nbsp;and the Cricket More&nbsp;plans, all Cricket data access plans come with Stream More, which helps our customers manage their data usage.\nStream More allows customers to watch more video over our wireless network while using less data by streaming certain high definition video at standard definition quality, similar to DVD (about 480p).\nStream More requires a compatible device and, once activated by Cricket on a customer's account, the customer can turn it off and back on at any time via the customer's online account or the myCricket app.\nLearn how.\nStream More may not be able to recognize all video content, and any unrecognized higher resolution video will continue to stream at its normal speed and resolution.</p>\n<p>Cricket will activate Stream More for individual customers when they subscribe to our service.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Stream More is not available with the Cricket Core Plan or the&nbsp;Cricket More Plan, which streams all video at a maximum speed of 1.5 Mbps (SD quality/about 480p).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How does Cricket manage network congestion for its Mobile broadband Internet access service?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Cricket strives to provide a high-quality Internet experience for all of our customers.&nbsp;The Internet consists of multiple interconnected networks and most Internet end points (such as websites and other content providers) are not directly connected to Cricket's network.&nbsp;Accordingly, Cricket must connect to and exchange traffic with other networks to provide its subscribers the capability of uploading data to, or downloading data from, Internet end points that are connected to those networks.\nCricket, through affiliates and third-parties, has entered into commercially negotiated agreements to exchange traffic with other networks (and the networks with which those networks are connected) on mutually agreeable terms.&nbsp;Although Cricket works diligently to ensure that it has sufficient capacity to support customer data traffic of our customers, the links Cricket and other networks use to exchange such traffic may occasionally become congested.\nConsistent with its arrangements with those other networks, Cricket may establish or expand the connections between its network and other networks, but only on mutually agreeable terms.&nbsp;If Cricket is unable to reach agreement on terms of interconnection or network expansion with these other networks, it could affect the performance of Cricket's data service.\nCricket does not guarantee that it will establish or expand the connections between its network and other networks, or that subscribers will be able to upload data to or download data from Internet end points connected to other networks at any particular speed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition, like the other networks that make up the Internet, Cricket's is a shared network, which means that the transmission links and other network resources used to provide broadband services are shared among its subscribers.\nCricket manages this network for the benefit of all users based on a variety of factors, and our technical expertise.&nbsp.\nNonetheless, temporary network congestion may occur when a large number of customers in a concentrated area access the network at the same time or when some customers consume a very large amount of network capacity during busy periods, such as at stadium events, during peak usage times, or during planned network maintenance activity.\nCricket therefore does not guarantee that subscribers will be able to upload or download data at any particular speed.</p>\n<p>Cricket also uses a network management practice we call Congestion Management to manage our network resources.\nCongestion Management may affect certain customers on the Cricket Core Plan Plan that provides unlimited data access.\nCustomers may experience reduced data speeds and increased latency during periods of network congestion as compared to other customers using the same cell site.\nAs always, even when subject to network management practices, customers on our unlimited plans have the comfort of knowing that, no matter how much data they use in a billing cycle, they will pay a single monthly flat rate.\nThat is the essential promise of an unlimited data access plan.\nReduced speeds and increased latency may cause web sites to load more slowly or affect the performance of data-heavy activities such as video streaming or interactive gaming.\nHowever, customers on our unlimited plans will experience reduced speeds and increased latency only if he or she uses data at a cell site experiencing network congestion at the same moment.\nAs soon as the congestion at the cell site abates, or if the customer's session migrates to an uncongested cell site, speeds and latency are not affected.\nIn addition, this network management practice adjusts dynamically to address the amount of congestion, which can start and stop over a very short time period (often measured in fractions of a second), further minimizing any customer impact.\nBecause the amount of congestion at a cell site can vary significantly, the performance impact for the affected customer may also vary significantly, but such impact will last only as long as the site is congested.</p>\n<p>On certain grandfathered plans, customers experience reduced speeds and increased latency only if they have exceeded 22 GB of data usage and use data at a cell site experiencing network congestion at the same moment.&nbsp;Cricket will notify customers on these grandfathered unlimited plans, during each monthly plan cycle when their data usage exceeds 75% of the pre-established data threshold (16.5GB of the 22 GB threshold) so they can adjust their usage to avoid potential, temporary reductions of their data speeds during the remainder of that plan cycle.</p>\n<p>Cricket activates Congestion Management for individual customers on Cricket's unlimited plans when they subscribe to Cricket's service.</p>\n<p>Another reasonable network management practice we will employ to use our network resources more efficiently is Stream More, discussed in more detail above, which is a feature that will be offered on all of our wireless plans that include data access except for the Cricket Core and the Cricket More plans.\nStream More allows customers to watch more video over our wireless network while using less data by streaming certain high definition video at standard definition quality, similar to DVD (about 480p).&nbsp;Stream More requires a compatible device and, once activated by Cricket on a customer's account, the customer can turn it off and back on at any time via the customer's online account or the myCricket app.\nLearn how.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Does Cricket favor certain websites or Internet applications by blocking, throttling or modifying particular protocols on its mobile broadband Internet access service?</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nNo, Cricket does not favor certain websites or Internet applications by blocking or throttling lawful internet traffic on the basis of content, application, service, user, or use of nonharmful devices on its broadband internet access services.\nNor do we modify particular protocols, protocol ports, or protocol fields in ways not prescribed by the protocol standards.\nHowever, in response to a specific security threat against our network or our customers, Cricket may occasionally need to limit the flow of traffic from certain locations or take other appropriate actions.</p>\n<p>Our mobile broadband internet access service data plans may include different speeds, video streaming quality, and other options consumers can choose among so as to find the best fit for the manner in which they intend to use their service.\nFor more information about our mobile broadband internet access service data plans, please go to https://www.cricketwireless.com/cell-phone-plans.html.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What types of security practices does Cricket use on its network?</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nCricket takes the security of our customers and our network very seriously.\nWe proactively monitor our network to guard against a wide range of security threats, including viruses, botnets, worms, distributed denial of service attacks, SPAM, and other harmful activity.<br>\n<br>\nWe use a variety of network tools to monitor our network to ensure its stability and functionality, to protect the network against threats, and for other operational purposes.&nbsp;We store the information we gather through this monitoring for as long as we have a business purpose to maintain it.&nbsp;The Cricket Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use and share this information.</p>\n<p>If we detect a security threat we will typically attempt to isolate the threat and prevent it from spreading across the network.\nWe may use a variety of security measures to prevent the spread of a threat, which may include blocking malicious or unlawful traffic, limiting the flow of traffic over some portions of the network, or taking other actions to address the threat.\nFor example, we block traffic originating outside our network that could transfer malicious or disruptive communications.\nWe attempt to limit those actions to the specific portions of the network or customer base impacted by the security threat and for only as long as necessary to mitigate the threat.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Does Cricket restrict the types of devices that customers can use with its mobile broadband Internet access service?</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nCricket customers may use compatible Cricket authorized 4G basic phones, smartphones, or tablets with our mobile broadband Internet access service, so long as the devices do not harm our network or other users.\nThese devices must also be used in a manner consistent with our Terms and Conditions of Service, Acceptable Use Policy and other policies.\nConsumers will need to ensure that the device they wish to attach is FCC-approved and compatible with the technology used in our mobile network.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Does Cricket employ any network optimization practices?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Cricket has adopted the following network optimization practices designed to provide a consistent, high-quality service experience for all of our customers using our mobile broadband Internet access service.\nThese optimization practices have the added benefit of reducing the amount of data customers transmit, which helps preserve their monthly high-speed data allowances.\nTo maximize these benefits, optimization is active at all times for the data traffic described below.\nCricket does not optimize data traffic based on the particular source or content of the traffic or the specific application used to access the traffic.\nAdditionally, these optimization practices do not apply to encrypted video or live video chat, nor do they affect videos or images that a customer sends or receives through a messaging application or as an attachment to an email.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Video Pacing</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Pacing, also called buffer tuning, involves transmitting video in segments to a customer's device, rather than immediately sending the entire video as fast as possible.\nOnce the phone receives the initial segment of video, the customer can begin viewing the video while the remaining segments download in a just-in-time fashion in the background.\nBecause the customer's device only receives the portion of the overall video that will be viewed next, rather than the entire video, pacing reduces the amount of data transmitted on the network at a given time and thus the potential for network congestion.\nThe reduced network load can result in video playback that is smoother and starts more quickly.\nIn addition, if the customer abandons the video before viewing its entire contents, the unviewed segments of the video will not have been transmitted to the customer, thus helping conserve the customer's high-speed data allowance.\nCricket uses pacing with all video delivered over a non-encrypted HTTP connection and transmitted in any of three standard video formats (Flash, MP4 and 3GP), regardless of the source of the video, the application used to view the video or the content of the video itself.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Image Compression</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Image compression reduces the file size of web page images sent over the network by removing data from the image file that is non-essential when viewing the image on a mobile device.\nReducing image file sizes helps Cricket use network resources more efficiently and enables our customers to experience faster-loading web pages while also using a smaller portion of their high-speed data allowance to view the web pages.</p>\n<p>Cricket compresses all images that are embedded in web pages in either of two industry standard formats (JPEG and GIF), regardless of the source or content of the web page or the application used to view it.\nCricket strives to compress web page images to provide a high quality user experience where the average consumer should not notice a difference between the source image and the compressed image.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS <p>\n<strong>What factors affect the performance of my mobile broadband Internet access service?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our monthly tiered phone service rate plans offer unlimited data with a fixed amount of high-speed data access with no overage charges: $30 (5&nbsp;GB) and $40 (10 GB).\nOn these tiered phone service plans, once you exhaust your high-speed data access allotment, your service over the cellular network will transmit data at a maximum of 128kbps for the remainder of the monthly plan cycle unless you purchase additional high-speed data access for the remainder of the month of service.</p>\n<p>Our monthly tiered data only plans offer a fixed amount of high-speed data access with no overage charges: $35/ 20 GB and $50/ 40 GB.\nOn these tiered data only plans, once you exhaust your high-speed data allotment, you will not have additional data access unless you purchase additional high-speed data access for the remainder of the month of service.<br>\n<br>\nIn addition, your mobile broadband Internet access service performance can be affected by a wide range of factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe capabilities of the server with which you are communicating, the capacity of the network to which that server is connected, the distance and number of routers (or \"hops\") between your device and the other Internet end point you are contacting, and general congestion on the Internet are common factors that can affect performance, regardless of your service type.\nOther factors include, but are not limited to, your proximity to a cell site, the capacity of the cell site, the number of other users connected to the same cell site, the surrounding terrain, use inside a building or a moving vehicle, radio frequency interference, the capabilities of your device, and the applications you use.\nIn addition, Cricket has designed its wireless services to ensure that our customers receive a high-quality voice experience during simultaneous voice and data sessions, which may affect data performance, including but not limited to a temporary reduction in speed to minimize the likelihood of dropped calls.</p>\n<p>Cricket offers its customers Voice over LTE (VoLTE or HD Voice) which shares Cricket's network infrastructure and may affect the availability of network resources for broadband Internet access services.\nYour use of VOLTE may affect the performance of your mass market broadband Internet access service.\nThis service may rely on particular network practices to assign different levels of priority dynamically or statically.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Where can I find information about the speed and latency of my mobile broadband Internet access service?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Because of all the different factors that can affect the performance of your mobile broadband Internet access service, Cricket does not guarantee specific levels of speed or latency for its wireless services.\nCricket also does not offer mobile broadband Internet access service in different speed tiers.&nbsp;The performance you can expect to receive from the services we offer is described below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Speed</em>\n</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe term \"speed\" is commonly used as a shorthand way to describe the capacity at which a particular mobile broadband Internet access service can transmit data.\nThis capacity is typically measured in the number of kilobits or megabits that can be transmitted in one second (Kbps or Mbps).\nSome applications like email or basic web browsing do not require a substantial amount of speed to function optimally, while other activities like transferring large data files can be performed faster with higher-speed data services.\nYour speed, at any given time, may not be suitable for some applications, particularly those involving real-time, high bandwidth uses such as streaming video or video conferencing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Latency</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Latency, also known as delay, is the amount of time from when a data packet is sent to when it is received.\nFor broadband Internet access services, latency is usually expressed as the round-trip time in milliseconds (ms) that it takes for a data packet to travel between two end points on the Internet (from point A to point B and then back to point A).\nSome applications, such as email, can tolerate a substantial amount of latency without any noticeable impact on the application's performance, while other applications, such as real-time video conferencing, require lower latency (meaning quicker round trip time) to function properly.</p>\n<p>Based on real-life data, Cricket's consumers can expect to receive the following download (DL) speeds, upload (UL) speeds, and latency subject to the performance-limiting factors described above (the range reported is from the 25th to the 75th percentile, which means that the 25th percentile lower bound is the value below which 25% of the test readings were, and the 75th percentile upper bound is the value below which 75% of the test readings were):</p>\n<strong>Speeds &amp.\nLatency</strong> &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;DL Speed (Mbps) &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;UL Speed (Mbps)
