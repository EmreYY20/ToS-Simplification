the way in which you use our products and/or services, and previous advertisements which you have clicked on.\nTo choose advertisements which are tailored and most likely to be of interest to you, we

address) to a third party service provider, namely Forter (http://www.forter.com) which conducts anti-fraud checks on our behalf.\nOur online store merely queries whether the payment information provided by you satisfies the criteria set by Forter's algorithm and then returns back the results.\nIf your payment information does not satisfy Forter's criteria, the payment request will be declined.<br>\n<br>This process may result in you not being able to complete a purchase on our site.\nYou may want to check your payment information or try again using a different method of payment.\nOtherwise, you may request that we provide information about our decision-making methodology and ask us to verify that the automated decision has been made correctly.\nWe may reject the request, as permitted by applicable law, including when providing the information would result in a disclosure of a trade secret or would interfere with the prevention or detection of fraud or other crime but generally in these circumstances we will ask Forter to verify that its algorithm and source data are functioning as anticipated without error or bias.</li>\n<li>6.\nSharing your Personal

corporate control.</li>\n<li>d.\n<strong>Sub-contractors and agents</strong>: We may use affiliates or other companies to provide services on our behalf such as data processing, account

Policy.<br>\n<br>Where we transfer Personal Information from inside the European Economic Area (the EEA) to outside the EEA, we may be required to take specific additional measures to safeguard the relevant Personal Information.\nCertain countries outside the EEA have been approved by the European Commission as providing essentially equivalent protections to EEA data protection laws and therefore no additional safeguards are required to export Personal Information to these jurisdictions.\nIn countries which have not had these approvals (see the full list here http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm), we will establish legal grounds justifying such transfer, such as EU Commission-approved model contractual clauses, or other legal grounds permitted by applicable legal requirements.<br>\n<br>If you live outside the EEA, or California, Razer will undertake best efforts to give you a similar degree of control over your privacy.</li>\n<li>9.\nSecurity of your Personal Information<br>(a) We use physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect against unauthorized use, access, modification, destruction, disclosure, loss or theft of your Personal Information in our custody or control.<br>\n<br>(b) We have agreements and controls in place with third party service providers requiring that any information we provide to them must be safeguarded and used only for the purpose of providing the service we have requested the company to perform.</li>\n<li>10.\nSecurity over the Internet<br>(a) No data transmission over the Internet or website can be guaranteed to be secure from intrusion.\nHowever, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information in accordance with data protection legislative requirements.<br>\n<br>(b) All information you provide to us is stored on our or our subcontractors' secure servers and accessed and used subject to our security policies and standards.\nWhere we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential and for complying with any other security procedures that we notify you of.\nWe ask you not to share a password with anyone.</li>\n<li>11.\nRetention of your Personal Information<br>Our retention periods for personal data are based on business needs and legal requirements.\nWe retain your Personal Information for as long as is necessary for the processing purpose(s) for which the information was collected, and any other permissible, related purpose.\nFor example, we may retain certain transaction details and correspondence until the time limit for claims arising from the transaction has expired, or to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the retention of such data.\nWhen Personal Information is no longer needed, we either irreversibly anonymise the data (and we may further retain and use the anonymised information) or securely destroy the data.</li>\n<li>12.\nMarketing<br>Most of our processing is permitted by \"legal grounds\" other than consent (see section 2 above).\nIn relation to Direct Marketing, where we are required to do so, we will obtain your consent before using your Personal Information for this purpose.\nIf you prefer not to receive our Direct Marketing communications and/or not have your Personal Information shared among the members of the Razer group for the purpose of marketing, you can have your name deleted from our Direct Marketing and/or shared information lists.<br>\n<br>Direct Marketing means our communication with you such as mail, telemarketing or email, using your contact

provide you with a copy of information that you have provided to us;<br>\n<br>(c) update any inaccuracies in the Personal Information we hold;<br>\n<br>(d) delete any Personal Information the we no
