our Sites and services work properly, we sometimes place small data files called cookies, or similar technology, on your device.\nA cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site.\nTechnologies such as local storage allows us to store data locally within the user's browser.\nThis enables the website or browser to remember your actions and preferences (such as language, search history, or other preferences) over a period of time, so you do not have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.</p>\n<p>If you wish to delete the search history data contained in local storage of your browser, simply click on the \u201cX\u201d next to your \u201cRecent Searches\u201d tab and the local

features of our website may not function correctly if you disable cookies.</p>\n<p>Most modern browsers allow you to change your cookie settings.\nYou can usually find these settings in the options or preferences menu of your browser.\nTo understand these settings, the following links for commonly used browsers may be helpful:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cookie settings in Chrome</li>\n<li>Cookie settings in

certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.\nWe do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is

contains procedures for <u>MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION</u>.</i>\n</p>\n<p>You agree that any dispute related to this Agreement, your use of the Site and Services, or any dispute related to your relationship with us or our affiliates, directors, officers, agents, shareholders, members, subsidiaries, parents, shall be submitted to binding arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), located in San Diego, California.\nThe AAA Rules of Arbitration shall govern all aspects of the arbitration you bring, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with this Arbitration Agreement.\nThe AAA Rules of Arbitration are available on the AAA\u2019s website, https://www.adr.org/Rules/.\nThe arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, with the prevailing party to pay all costs and attorney fees.\nAny judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Jury Trial Waiver.</u>\n<i>Please read this Section carefully.\nIt is part of your agreement with us and affects your rights.\nIt contains a <u>WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL</u>.</i>\n</p>\n<p>You hereby waive your constitutional and statutory rights to go to court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration.\nArbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.\nIn the event any litigation should arise between you and us in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</u>\n<i>Please read this Section carefully.\nIt is part of your agreement with us and affects your rights.\nIt contains a <u>WAIVER OF YOUR CLASS ACTION RIGHTS</u>.</i>\n</p>\n<p>ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.</p>\n<p>\n<u>30-Day Right to Opt Out.</u> You have the right to opt out of the Arbitration, Jury Trial Waiver and Class Action Waiver Provisions of this Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: PO Box 2234, Rancho Santa Fe, CA 92067, within 30 days from the date you first create use the Services.\nIf you send this notice, then the Arbitration, Jury Trial Waiver and Class Action Waiver Provisions will not apply, and you must bring claims per the Section labeled \u201cGoverning Law,\u201d below.\nIf you do not send this notice, then you agree to be bound by the terms of the Arbitration, Jury Trial Waiver and Class Action Waiver Provisions in this Section.\nAgreeing to arbitration and waiving your rights to jury trial and class action participation is an important decision for you to make.\nIt can shorten the litigation process and result in cost savings, but it also takes away certain rights, such as the right to a trial in front of your peers.\nThus, please take time to carefully consider the Arbitration, Jury Trial Waiver and Class Action Waiver Provisions of this Agreement.\nSince the information provided in this Agreement is not intended to contain a complete explanation of the consequences of arbitration, class action or jury waiver, you may want to consult an attorney.</p>\n<p>If you are based in the
