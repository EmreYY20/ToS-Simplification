Policy&lt;/h1&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nWe respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this privacy policy (\u201cPolicy\u201d).\nThis Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide (\u201cPersonal Information\u201d) on the{' '} &lt;a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://gdlauncher.com\" &gt.\ngdlauncher.com &lt;/a&gt;{' '} website (\u201cWebsite\u201d), \u201cGDLauncher\u201d application (\u201cApplication\u201d), and any of their related products and services (collectively, \u201cServices\u201d), and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that Personal Information.\nIt also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update it.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nThis Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (\u201cUser\u201d, \u201cyou\u201d or \u201cyour\u201d) and this Website operator and Application developer (\u201cOperator\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d).\nIf you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in which case the terms \u201cUser\u201d, \u201cyou\u201d or \u201cyour\u201d shall refer to such entity.\nIf you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not access and use the Services.\nBy accessing and using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Policy.\nThis Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;h2&gt;Automatic collection of information&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nWhen you open the Website or use the Application, our servers automatically record information that your browser or device sends.\nThis data may include information such as your device\u2019s IP address and location, browser and device name and version, operating system type and version, language preferences, the webpage you were visiting before you came to the Services, pages of the Services that you visit, the time spent on those pages, the information you search for on the Services, access times and dates, and other statistics.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nInformation collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding the usage and traffic of the Services.\nThis statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular User of the system.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;h2&gt;Collection of personal information&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nYou can access and use the Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual.\nIf, however, you wish to use some of the features offered on the Services, you may be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail address).\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nWe receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an account, publish content, make a purchase, or fill any online forms on the Services.\nWhen required, this information may include the following: &lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt.\nAccount details (such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc) &lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt.\nContact information (such as email address, phone number, etc) &lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt.\nAny other materials you willingly submit to us (such as articles, images, feedback, etc) &lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nSome of the information we collect is directly from you via the Services.\nHowever, we may also collect Personal Information about you from other sources such as public databases, social media platforms, third-party data providers, and our joint marketing partners.\nPersonal Information we collect from other sources may include demographic information, such as age and gender, device information, such as IP addresses, location, such as city and state, and online behavioral data, such as information about your use of social media websites, page view information and search results and links.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nYou can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the features on the Services.\nUsers who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;h2&gt;Privacy of children&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nWe do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13.\nIf you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Services.\nIf you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us through the Services, please contact us to request that we delete that child\u2019s Personal Information from our Services.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nWe encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children\u2019s Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through the Services without their permission.\nWe also ask that all parents and legal guardians overseeing the care of children take the necessary precautions to ensure that their children are instructed to never give out Personal Information when online without their permission.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;h2&gt;Use and processing of collected information&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nWe act as a data controller and a data processor in terms of the GDPR when handling Personal Information, unless we have entered into a data processing agreement with you in which case you would be the data controller and we would be the data processor.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nOur role may also differ depending on the specific situation involving Personal Information.\nWe act in the capacity of a data controller when we ask you to submit your Personal Information that is necessary to ensure your access and use of the Services.\nIn such instances, we are a data controller because we determine the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Information and we comply with data controllers\u2019 obligations set forth in the GDPR.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nWe act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you submit Personal Information through the Services.\nWe do not own, control, or make decisions about the submitted Personal Information, and such Personal Information is processed only in accordance with your instructions.\nIn such instances, the User providing Personal Information acts as a data controller in terms of the GDPR.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nIn order to make the Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we may need to collect and use certain Personal Information.\nIf you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services.\nAny of the information we collect from you may be used for the following purposes: &lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Create and manage user accounts&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Deliver products or services&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Improve products and services&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Send product and service updates&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Respond to inquiries and offer support&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Request user feedback&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Improve user experience&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Protect from abuse and malicious users&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Run and operate the Services&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nProcessing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Services, where you are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific purposes.\nthis, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to California Consumer Privacy Act or European data protection law.\n(ii) provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof.\n(iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject.\n(iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us.\n(v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nWe rely on the following legal bases as defined in the GDPR upon which we collect and process your Personal Information: &lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;User\u2019s consent&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Performance of a contract&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Our own legitimate interests&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nNote that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing by opting out, without having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases above.\nIn any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;h2&gt;Payment processing&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nIn case of Services requiring payment, you may need to provide your credit card details or other payment account information, which will be used solely for processing payments.\nWe use third-party payment processors (\u201cPayment Processors\u201d) to assist us in processing your payment information securely.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nPayment Processors adhere to the latest security standards as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.\nSensitive and private data exchange happens over a SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures, and the Services are also in compliance with strict vulnerability standards in order to create as secure of an environment as possible for Users.\nWe will share payment data with the Payment Processors only to the extent necessary for the purposes of processing your payments, refunding such payments, and dealing with complaints and queries related to such payments and refunds.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nPlease note that the Payment Processors may collect some Personal Information from you, which allows them to process your payments (e.g., your email address, address, credit card details, and bank account number) and handle all the steps in the payment process through their systems, including data collection and data processing.\nThe Payment Processors\u2019 use of your Personal Information is governed by their respective privacy policies which may or may not contain privacy protections as protective as this Policy.\nWe suggest that you review their respective privacy policies.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;h2&gt;Managing information&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nYou are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you.\nThe Personal Information you can delete may change as the Services change.\nWhen you delete Personal Information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised Personal Information in our records for the duration necessary to comply with our obligations to our affiliates and partners, and for the purposes described below.\nIf you would like to delete your Personal Information or permanently delete your account, you can do so by contacting us.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;h2&gt;Disclosure of information&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nDepending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any Service you have requested, we may share your information with our affiliates, contracted companies, and service providers (collectively, \u201cService Providers\u201d) we rely upon to assist in the operation of the Services available to you and whose privacy policies are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our policies with respect to Personal Information.\nWe will not share any personally identifiable information with third parties and will not share any information with unaffiliated third parties.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nService Providers are not authorized to use or disclose your information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements.\nService Providers are given the information they need only in order to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose any of the provided information for their own marketing or other purposes.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;h2&gt;Retention of information&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nWe will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal obligations, as long as your user account remains active, to enforce our agreements, resolve disputes, and unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nWe may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.\nOnce the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted.\nTherefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification, and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;h2&gt;Transfer of information&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nDepending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a country other than your own.\nThe transfer of your Personal Information to countries outside the European Union will be made only if you have explicitly consented to it or in the cases provided for by the GDPR and will be processed in your interest.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nYou are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard your information.\nIf any such transfer takes place, you can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this Policy or inquire with us using the information provided in the contact section.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;h2&gt;Data

processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation to justify the objection.\nYou must know that, however, should your Personal Information be processed for direct marketing purposes, you can object to that processing at any time without providing any justification.\nTo learn whether we are processing Personal Information for direct marketing purposes, you may refer to the relevant sections of this Policy.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\n(v) You have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of your Personal Information.\nThese circumstances

rights&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nConsumers residing in California are afforded certain additional rights with respect to their Personal Information under the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d).\nIf you are a California resident, this section applies to you.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nIn addition to the rights as explained in this Policy, California residents who provide Personal Information as defined in the statute to obtain Services for personal, family, or household use are entitled to request and obtain from us, once a calendar year, information about the categories and specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected and disclosed.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nFurthermore, California residents have the right to request deletion of their Personal Information or opt-out of the sale of their Personal Information which may include selling, disclosing, or transferring Personal Information to another business or a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.\nTo do so, simply contact us.\nWe will not discriminate against you if you exercise your rights under the

cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server.\nCookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.\nCookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.\nIf you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the features of the Services.\nYou may learn more about cookies and how they work{' '} &lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.websitepolicies.com/blog/cookies\" rel=\"noreferrer\" &gt.\nhere &lt;/a&gt.\n.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nWe may use cookies to collect, store, and track information for security and personalization, to operate the Services, and for statistical purposes.\nPlease note that you have the ability to accept or decline cookies.\nMost web browsers automatically accept cookies by default, but you can modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;h2&gt;Data analytics&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nOur Services may use third-party analytics tools that use cookies, web beacons, or other similar information-gathering technologies to collect standard internet activity and usage information.\nThe information gathered is used to compile statistical reports on User activity such as how often Users visit our Services, what pages they visit and for how long, etc.\nWe use the information obtained from these analytics tools to monitor the performance and improve our

websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked.\nTracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection with a website.\nFor these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use or visit a website or online service as they move across different websites over time.\nHow browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform.\nAs a result, the Services are not yet set up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by your browser.\nEven so, as described in more detail throughout this Policy, we limit our use and collection of your Personal Information.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;h2&gt;Advertisements&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nWe may display online advertisements and we may share aggregated and non-identifying information about our customers that we or our advertisers collect through your use of the Services.\nWe do not share personally identifiable information about individual customers

these Social Media Features are governed by the privacy policy of their respective providers.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;h2&gt;Email

owned or controlled by us.\nPlease be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties.\nWe encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the privacy statements of each and every resource that may collect Personal Information.\n&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;/div&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;h2&gt;Information security&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;div&gt.\n&lt;p&gt.\nWe secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.\nWe maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of Personal Information in our control and
