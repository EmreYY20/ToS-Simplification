informally for at least thirty (30) days\nbefore initiating arbitration.\nSuch informal\nnegotiations commence upon written notice from one Party\nto the other Party.\n<br>\n<strong>Binding\nArbitration</strong>\n<br> If the Parties are unable\nto resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those\nDisputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by\nbinding arbitration.\nYOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE\nTHE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.\nThe arbitration shall be\ncommenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American\nArbitration Association (\"AAA\") and, where appropriate, the AAA\u2019s Supplementary\nProcedures for Consumer Related Disputes (\"AAA Consumer Rules\"), both of which\nare available at the AAA website www.adr.org.\nYour arbitration fees\nand your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer\nRules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.\nIf such costs are determined by the arbitrator to\nbe excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and\nexpenses.\nThe arbitration\nmay be conducted in\nperson, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online.\nThe arbitrator\nwill make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons\nunless requested by either Party.\nThe arbitrator must follow applicable law, and\nany award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.\nExcept where\notherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the\narbitration will take place in Delaware .\nExcept as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to\ncompel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate,\nor enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n<br>\nIf for any\nreason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall\nbe commenced or prosecuted in the state and\nfederal courts located in Delaware , and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of\nlack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and\njurisdiction in such state and federal courts\n.\nApplication of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International\nSale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded\nfrom these Terms of Use\n.\n<br> In no event shall\nany\nDispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be\ncommenced more than one (1) years after the\ncause of action arose.\nIf\nthis provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither\nParty will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of\nthis provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute\nshall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts\nlisted for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the\npersonal jurisdiction of that court.\n<br>\n<strong>Restrictions</strong>\n<br>\nThe\nParties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the\nDispute between the Parties individually.\nTo the full extent permitted by law, (a) no\narbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding.\n(b) there is no right or\nauthority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class\naction procedures.\nand (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought\nin a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other\npersons.\n<br>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n<strong>Exceptions to Informal\nNegotiations and Arbitration</strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n<br> The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not\nsubject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding\narbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity\nof, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party.\n(b) any Dispute related to, or\narising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use.\nand (c) any claim for injunctive relief.\nIf this provision is found to be illegal or\nunenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within\nthat portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute\nshall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for\njurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that\ncourt.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>20.\nCORRECTIONS</strong>\n<br>\nThere\nmay be information on the Site that contains\ntypographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions, including descriptions,
