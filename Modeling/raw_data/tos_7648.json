unrestrictedly and unreservedly to all the Services proposed by the Company on its Site, accessible through the address www.ulule.com, apart from specific conditions applicable to certain

reserves the right to unilaterally modify the General Terms and Conditions of Use at any time without notice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The new characteristics will be put online on the Site to inform Users and Project Owners.\nIt is thus Users' responsibility to view and agree to the General Terms and Conditions of Use when they make Contributions, so that they are aware of the current provisions.\nEvery use by Users of the Services proposed on the Site implies acceptance of the latest version of the General Terms and Conditions of Use published on the Site.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>Article 2.\nConditions for accessing and registering on the Ulule Site2.1 Consent and legal capacity<p>Registrations are made by completing an online form.\nThe form must be validated after completion.\nWhen registering, Users and Project Owners undertake to provide accurate information, and must complete all the mandatory fields in the registration form.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Users who are natural persons must be of age and have the legal capacity to contract.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Representatives of Users that are legal entities must certify that they have all the rights required to sign this document on behalf of the legal entity they represent.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Company reserves the right to refuse registration to any Users who do not meet its standards of good character or who infringe the values and ethics the Company endeavours to promote, without the Company having to provide a reason for its refusal.\nThe Company is the sole decision-maker regarding the registrations it retains, with no possible appeal or indemnity of any kind.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Users undertake not to create or use other accounts than the one initially created, whether under their own or a third party\u2019s identity.\nAny exemption from this rule must be requested explicitly by the User and the Company must grant its express, specific authorisation.\nThe fact of creating or using new accounts under their own identity or that of a third party without having requested and obtained the Company's authorisation may lead to the immediate suspension of Users' accounts and all associated services.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Users guarantee that information they communicate on the Site is accurate, true and not misleading.\nThey undertake to inform the Company promptly if any information communicated at registration is modified, and, if need be, to make these modifications themselves in their personal spaces.</p>2.2 Login and password<p>When they create an account, Users choose or are allocated a login and password (hereinafter \u201cUser Identification\") enabling them to access their personal spaces.\nThis User Identification is personal and confidential.\nIt can only be changed if Users so request, or at the Company's initiative.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Users are solely and entirely responsible for the use of the User Identification concerning them and undertake to make every effort to keep this information secret and not to disclose it to any other party in any form for any reason.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Users are responsible for the use of their User Identification by third parties or actions or declarations made via their personal User accounts, whether or not these are fraudulent, and must hold the Company harmless against any action in this respect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Furthermore, as the Company has no obligation and does not possess the technical means to ensure the identity of persons registering on the Ssite, it is not liable if a User's identity is usurped.\nIf Users have reasons to believe that someone is fraudulently using their User ID or account, they must promptly inform the Company.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If User Identification concerning them is lost or stolen, Users are responsible for any harmful consequences of this loss or theft, and should use the procedure for modifying their User ID as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Should they become aware of another person accessing their Personal Account, Users should immediately inform the Site manager by email at this address: privacy@ulule.com, and confirm this information by recorded letter to the following address: ULULE SAS, 10 rue de Penthi\u00e8vre, 75008 Paris, FRANCE.</p>\n<p>Use of the Site that is fraudulent orinfringes these General Terms and Conditions will justify refusing the User access to the Services or other functions of the Site, at any time.</p>Article 3.\nConditions Applicable to Project Owners3.1 Nature of the Services available to Project Owners<p>The Site enables Users who so wish to present their Project(s)in order to disseminate, promote and raise funds for a Project on the Site.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The conditions applicable to Project Owners only concern Projects managed by Project Owners, who create and manage a community of Users supporting their Projects on the Site.\nIn this respect, the Company acts as a technical intermediary by providing Project Owners with an online platform enabling them to finance, disseminate and promote their Projects on a webpage or a series of pages dedicated to these Projects.</p>3.2 Presentation of Projects<p>Project Owners who wish to promote their Projects and obtain financing submit to the Company, for publication on the Site, a presentation detailing the nature, objectives, main characteristics and running of the Projects they wish to develop with support from Ululers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To be accepted by the Company for possible promotion on the Site, Project Owners undertake to provide, with every Project submitted, a clear and accurate description of the Project, the minimum amount of Contributions required for the Project to be considered as financed, the Fundraising Period, and the Rewards they are offering.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Project\u2019s characteristics and parameters are submitted for the prior approval of the Company, which has no obligation to provide reasons for rejecting it, and in no way guarantees Ululers as to the Project\u2019s success or the authenticity of information presented by the Project Owner.\nThe selection of contents is primarily designed to verify the consistency and quality of the Project, not to control the viability or authenticity of the Project proposed.</p>\n<p>For example, the Company will systematically refuse any whimsical or meaningless projects, and any that are patently unrealisable and doomed to failure.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once posted online on the Site, Projects may no longer be modified except to make corrections solely deisgned to assist the achievement of the Project\u2019s objectives.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is the Project Owners' task to ensure that they have all the rights required to publish the Project on the Site, and that they comply with all legislation and regulations applicable to the design and realisation of the Project concerned.\nIn particular, Project Owners must not submit projects that infringe current laws and regulations, could affront human dignity or a person's privacy, jeopardise the protection of third parties' personal data (see the Ulule Privacy policy ), contravene moral standards or incite or perform an illegal activity or any other activity infringing the Company's rights or those of its co-contractors, other Users and more generally any third person.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Project Owners are entirely responsible for the content of the Project presentation published on the Site and must ensure that this presentation does not mislead Users.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Project Owners acknowledge that the provision of misleading, incomplete or erroneous information could incur their liability towards the Company and Users, and assume entire responsibility for the consequences of any omission or negligence in this respect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the event of the death or incapacity of Project Owners&nbsp;or an accident or any other event making them unable to manage their Projects, the Company is authorised to suspend the fundraising process under way.\nMore generally, the Company may, at its discretion, cancel a fundraising process and terminate to a Project if it is established that the Project Owner has infringed these Terms and Conditions.</p>\n<p>In this event, all the Contributions registered will be immediately cancelled and the Ululers concerned reimbursed, and the Project Owner will have no right to claim the sums raised.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Project Owners acknowledge that they are firmly committed to implementing every possible means to carry their Projects through if they raise the necessary Contributions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They are encouraged to regularly update their Projects and to share information concerning the latest news of their Projects and their implementation with the other Users.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They undertake to keep Ululers informed of major progress in their Projects, even after the Fundraising Period has ended.</p>3.3 Promotion on and outside the Site<p>In the context of the management of Projects and the Company\u2019s marketing operations, the Company may decide to promote the Projects, Services, Site and/or the Company.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Project Owners agree through these Terms and Conditions that the contents and information they provide may be freely exploited by the Company to promote their Projects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Project Owners therefore grant the Company the rights indicated below, exclusively and at no cost, for the entire world and for the entire period of these Terms and Conditions, so that the Company can provide the Service in the form of distribution on the Internet, on mobile telephony networks and/or any other current communication network available to the public.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this respect, Project Owners grant the Company the right to:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp.\nUse their names and the name and characteristics of their Projects in its communication and promotion of the Site;</p>\n<p>-&nbsp.\nReproduce and have reproduced the contents and information provided on the Site on any network, using any procedure, in any form known or unknown, whether or not in association with other works of any kind, when such use involves promoting the Project;</p>\n<p>-&nbsp.\nRepresent the Project contents or have them represented in whole or in part;</p>\n<p>-&nbsp.\nAdapt the Project contents or have them adapted in whole or in part.</p>\n<p>Project Owners also expressly authorise the Company to promote or advertise Projects and to distribute advertising, commercial and/or promotional messages concerning third parties\u2019 products or services with the contents.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Project Owners also expressly accept that the contents and information provided may be used on the Site alongside the trademarks or logos of the Company's partners.</p>3.4 Realisation of Projects/Obligations of Project Owners<p>Project Owners undertake to fulfil all their obligations to Ululers, including completing the Project as initially defined, and to award them any Rewards described in the Project.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Project Owners should ensure their ability to provide the Rewards they propose to Ululers at the end of the fundraising processes started for financing their Projects.\nRewards can be of any nature, not only financial (personal creations, works, partnership offers, invitations, etc.).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Project Owners undertake not to propose or provide any illicit Rewards, including those of a sexual, racist, discriminatory, libellous, harmful or xenophobic nature, that incite violence, harm the image of third parties, jeopardise public order or flout moral standards, infringe laws, professional secrecy or the ownership and rights of brands, patents or any other intellectual or industrial creation belonging to third parties, or that are dangerous or falsified.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If Project Owners are unable to award the promised Rewards to Ululers, they expressly undertake to reimburse the latter in full, and accept that the Company can under no circumstances assist them in this process.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Project Owners expressly acknowledge that they are solely responsible for managing the administrative, accounting, fiscal and social aspects of the Project, including sums received via the Company.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Company is not responsible for the actions of Project Owners, who remain solely responsible for the terms linking them with Ululers in the context of raising Contributions via the Site.\nProject Owners are responsible for the Contributions they organise via the Site and any Rewards they propose in connection with Projects presented on the Site.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Consequently, the risks inherent to the development and management of a Project, such as the possible delay or cancellation of a Project, are entirely assumed by Project Owners.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Project Owners can organise reimbursements at their sole discretion.\nThe Company is not responsible for the reimbursement or non-reimbursement of Contributions made.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Project Owners undertake not to propose their Projects or any other related Projects on any other online crowdfunding site or platform.</p>Article 4.\nConditions applicable to fundraising and Contribution-monitoring services4.1 Raising Contributions<p>Ululeurs have total freedom as regards the amount and allocation of their Contributions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If appropriate, they may choose the level of Reward proposed by Project Owners, provided that the amount of the Contribution paid is equal to or higher than the value of the Reward chosen.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In accepting these Terms and Conditions, Ululers declare that the source of the funds they use on the Site is not illegal, and undertake not to use this source for an illegal or fraudulent activity, including money laundering.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please note that the Company is only an intermediary between Project Owners and Ululers in the context of promoting a Project, mainly by making its Services and the Site available to Project Owners and Ululers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Consequently, Ululers may not seek the Company's responsibility if Project Owners fail to meet their obligations.</p>4.2 Payment of Contributions by Ululers<p>The Company does not receive commissions from Ululers on Contributions raised.\nThis is because the Company only takes a commission from Project Owners.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Contributions are paid using one of the payment methods proposed for the Project concerned, which may be a bank card, and/or PayPal, and/or payment by cheque, and/or any other means of payment already available on the Site or incorporated into the Service subsequently.</p>4.2.1 Payment online using a method other than Paypal<p>When you make a Contribution to a Project or publish a Project, you accept the terms and conditions of use of the payment systems used on the Site.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u25cf&nbsp.\nWith fund payment and collection flows in euros: the Company has decided to use Mangopay SA\u2019s Mangopay solution for all electronic payment services carried out in euros.\nBy using the system available on the Site to make a payment in euros or collect funds in euros, you thus agree to Mangopay\u2019s terms and conditions of use, which are appended to this document and form an integral part of the Ulule Site\u2019s general terms and conditions of use.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u25cf&nbsp.\nWith fund payment and collection flows in a currency other than the euro: the payment and collection of funds in a currency other than the euro are carried out using the Stripe Connect payment system.\nBy using the payment system available on the Okpal Site to make a payment or collect funds in a currency otherthan the euro, you accept Stripe Connect\u2019s terms and conditions of use.\nAll Stripe Connect\u2019s terms and conditions of use can be found here: https://stripe.com/connect/account-terms</p>4.2.3 Payment via PAYPAL<p>By contributing to a Project using the PayPal system, Ululers accepts PayPal\u2019s terms and conditions of use, available on &nbsp.\nwww.paypal.fr .\nContributions are only debited if Project Owners achieve their goal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>PayPal deducts its own commission from payments made.\nThis commission applied by PayPal is received directly by PayPal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Company applies its own commission as payment for its intermediation service, as indicated in article 4.4.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is stipulated that support for a Projet via the PayPal system is not eligible for Protection for PayPal purchases as defined in article 13 of the PayPal Service terms and conditions of use, which excludes such protection for payments made on crowdfunding or participative loan platforms (see article 13.3.iv).</p>4.2.3 Payment to Project Owners by cheque or bank transfer<p>The Company reserves the right to accept or refuse payment by cheque or bank transfer for each Project submitted by Project Owners.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If not, the&nbsp;Project Owners manage Contributions themselves, receiving Contributions directly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cheques or bank transfers should be sent to Project Owners by Ululers.\nProject Owners must then provide the Company with evidence that they have received cheques or bank transfers, in the form of a copy or photograph of the cheque, or proof of receipt of the transfer.</p>\n<p>The Company will then manually validate the incorporation of these Contributions by cheque or transfer into the sums raised by the Project.\nProject Owners must provide the Company with proof of receipt of cheques or transfers before the end of the Fundraising Period.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Proof that the cheque was issued, or the cheque itself, must in any event be received by the Company by the end of the Fundraising Period.\nCheques or bank transfers received after the end of the Fundraising Period, even if issued and/or sent prior to this date, may under no circumstances be incorporated into the Funds raised.</p>4.3 Management of Contributions4.3.1 Payment by bank card via the Payment Service Provider Mangopay (payments in euros)<p>With payments made in euros, Ulule uses the Payment Service Provider Mangopay.\nWith these transactions, Contributions are immediately debited from Ululers\u2019s accounts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ululers may cancel their Contributions before the expiry of the Fundraising Period.\nIn this case, the amount of their Contribution is automatically re-credited to their account.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the Financing Goal has not been achieved by the end of the Fundraising Period, Ululers\u2019 Contributions are recredited to their accounts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If by the end of the Fundraising Period, the Financing Goal has been achieved or exceeded, Ululers\u2019 Contributions are transferred to Project Owners\u2019 bank accounts.\nAt this point, Ululers who made Contributions using the system set up by the Company and its partner Mangopay can no longer be reimbursed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the event of a dispute, Ululers should take action against the Project Owner.</p>4.3.2 Payment by bank card via the Payment Service Provider Stripe (payments in a currency other than the euro)<p>With payments made in a currency other than the euro, Ulule uses the Payment Service Provider Stripe.\nWith these transactions, Contributions are not immediately debited from Ululers\u2019 accounts.\nA payment authorisation is registered, which will only be carried out if the Fundraising Goal has been achieved when the Fundraising Period ends.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ululers may cancel their Contributions before the expiry of the Fundraising Period.\nIn this event, their Contributions will never be debited.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If&nbsp;the Financing Goal has not been achieved by the end of the Fundraising Period, Ululers\u2019 Contributions will not be debited.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If at the end of the Fundraising Period, the Financing Goal has been achieved or exceeded, Ululers\u2019 Contributions are debited and transferred to Project Owners\u2019 bank accounts.\nAt this point, Ululers who made Contributions using the system set up by the Company and its partner Stripe can no longer be reimbursed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the event of a dispute, Ululers should take action against the Project Owner.</p>4.3.2 Payment by cheque or bank transfer<p>Project Owners undertake only to cash Contributions made by cheque once the Fundraising Period is over, and solely if the Financing Goal for their Project has been achieved.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Before the expiry date of the Fundraising Period, Ululers can cancel their Contributions at any time and ask Project Owners not to cash their cheques, but to destroy them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With payments by bank transfer, Project Owners undertake to reimburse Ululers\u2019 Contributions if the Project's Financing Goal has not been achieved by the end of the Fundraising Period.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With payments by bank transfer, Ululers can cancel their Contributions at any time before the expiry date of the Fundraising Period, and ask Project Owners to reimburse payments transferred in this way.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the event of a dispute, Ululers should take action against the Project Owner.</p>4.3.3 Payment via PAYPAL<p>&nbsp;Ululers can cancel their Contributions at any time before the expiry date of the Fundraising Period.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The payment of Contributions via PayPal will only be carried out by the Company if the Project\u2019s Financing Goal has been achieved by the end of the Fundraising Period.\nThe corresponding sums will then be paid from Ululers\u2019 PayPal accounts to Project Owners' PayPal accounts.\nAt that point, the Company can no longer cancel the corresponding Contributions or reimburse the Ululers who made them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition, it is stipulated that the Financing of the Project via Paypal is not eligible for Protection for PayPal purchases as defined in article 13 of the PayPal Service terms and conditions of use, which excludes such protection for payments made on crowdfunding or participative loan platforms (see article 13.3.iv).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the event of a dispute, Ululers should take action against the Project Owner.</p>4.4 Commission remunerating the intermediation Service and the transfer of sums raised.<p>Access to the Site is free.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Company receives a commission on the funds raised by Projects of Project Owners that have achieved or exceeded their Financing Goal by the end of the Fundraising Period.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For Project Owners receiving Contributions, the cost of the Services provided by the Company are calculated as a percentage of the amount of Contributions raised via the Site.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The percentage applicable varies according to the payment method, the volume of funds raised and the currency in which the funds are raised.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For Project Owners raising funds in euros, the following pricing applies:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp.\nBracket ranging from \u20ac0 to \u20ac100,000 of funds raised: commission of 6.67% excluding tax for funds raised via Bank Cards, and 4.17% excluding tax for funds raised via Paypal or in cheques or bank transfers;</p>\n<p>-&nbsp.\nBracket ranging from \u20ac100,001 to \u20ac250,000 of funds raised: commission of 5.83% excluding tax for funds raised via Bank Cards, and 3.33% excluding tax for funds raised via Paypal or in cheques or bank transfers;</p>\n<p>-&nbsp.\nBracket ranging from \u20ac250,001 to \u20ac500,000 of funds raised: commission of 5.00% excluding tax for funds raised via Bank Cards, and 2.50% excluding tax for funds raised via Paypal or in cheques or bank transfers;</p>\n<p>-&nbsp.\nFunds raised above \u20ac500,000:&nbsp;commission of 4.17% excluding tax for funds raised via Bank Cards, and 1.67% excluding tax for funds raised via Paypal or in cheques or bank transfers;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Example of calculation:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A project has raised \u20ac166,000 on Ulule, with \u20ac112,000 raised via bank cards, and \u20ac54,000 raised through Paypal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The commission remunerating the intermediation Service is calculated as follows:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All the funds are first added up regardless of the payment method (\u20ac166,000), to apply the pricing for each Paypal/cheque/bank transfer bracket.\nAfter that, commission of 2.50% excluding tax is applied solely for the funds raised via bank cards, which constitutes the difference between the pricing for bank cards and the pricing for cheques/bank transfers/PayPal, whatever the level:</p>\n<p>\u20ac100,000 * 4.17% + \u20ac66,000 * 3.33% + \u20ac112,000 * 2.50% = \u20ac9,167.80 in commission excluding tax.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With Project Owners raising funds in a currency other than the euro, the commission is 6.67% excluding tax for funds raised via bank cards, and 4.17% excluding tax for funds raised via Paypal or in cheques or bank transfers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>VAT is applicable at the current rate on the date when the funds raised are transferred, and depends on the Project Owner\u2019s location.\nThe services provided by Ulule SAS are considered by community legislation to be electronic services, and the VAT rate applicable when Project Owners are private individual thus depends on their location.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Since 1 January 2015, the provision of electronic services has been taxable in the place of consumption when these services are provided by parties subject to VAT, whether or not residing in the European Union territory (EU), to non-taxable persons (\u201cconsumers\u201d) who have their domicile or usual residence in EU territory.\nElectronic service provisions are thus taxable at the current VAT rate in the member State where the consumer is domiciled (e.g.\n20% for a private Project Owner based in France, which results in a commission rate of 8% including VAT for funds under \u20ac100,000 raised via bank cards).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a Project has raised funds through bank card payments, the costs of the services corresponding to all the payment methods used are deducted by the Company from the amount of contributions raised via the Site when the sums are transferred to Project Owners.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This transfer is made within a maximum period of 12 working days after the end of the Fundraising Period, when Project Owners have indicated all the information required for transferring the sums (including their bank details) and provided all the identification data necessary for the payment of funds (bank account particulars, copy of identity papers, etc.).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a Contribution by bank card is insufficient for the Company to deduct its commission, the Project Owner should pay the Company the amount of the commission due on receipt of an invoice.</p>4.5 Applicable taxes on funds raised and the issuing of tax receipts<p>All Users are responsible for paying any related tax or duty applicable, whether on the Contributions raised via the Ste as a Project Owner, or on the Contributions paid by Ululers to support a Project.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Under no circumstances may the Company replace them to this end, nor may it even advise them on the nature and details of their obligations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Project Owners are responsible for drawing up any tax receipts certifying donations made via the Site and transmitting them directly to Ululers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All Ululers are responsible for checking their eligibility for tax rebates on all or part of the Contributions they make via the Site, pursuant to current French legislation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Any claims regarding the provision of these tax receipts and the information contained in them must be made directly by Ululers to Project Owners.</p>4.6 Information on Ululeurs transmitted to Project Owners<p>To enable Project Owners to send the promised Rewards and/or tax receipts to Ululers, the Company provides Project Owners with information on the identity of Ululers who have contributed to a Project together with their postal addresses, in line with the &nbsp.\nUlule Privacy Policy .\nFor further information on the data

contents.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Users and Project Owners must ensure that they hold the necessary rights to publish the contents they disseminate, particularly intellectual property

Owners are solely responsible for the contents and data they post online in the Forums and feedback spaces, and guarantee that the information published does not infringe any current legal or

within the meaning of article 6 I 2\u00b0 of the LCEN (Confidence in the Digital Economy Act) and as such practises a simple storage activity.</p>5.2.\nSite Users: keeping the Company informed<p>All Users must inform the Company of any illicit or manifestly illicit content by email, at this address: privacy@ulule.com .</p>5.3.\nRight to delete the contents and/or Personal Accounts of Users or

manifestly illicit content it becomes aware of, together with the Personal Accounts of the Users or Project Owners who published the illicit content.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Furthermore, pursuant to

brought to its notice, in accordance with the &nbsp.\nUlule Privacy Policy .</p>Article 6.\nPeriod of the relationship with the Company<p>These General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use apply

the equipment, software and parameters required for the Site to operate properly.\nUsers must possess the skills, hardware and software required for using the Internet.\nUsers acknowledge that they are well aware of the characteristics and constraints of the Internet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Given the specific features of the Internet, the Company provides no guarantee of continuous service, as it is only bound by a best-endeavours obligation in this respect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Company's liability cannot be incurred in the event of damage linked with the temporary impossibility of accessing any of the services offered by the Site.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>No delay, suspension or cancellation in the dissemination of a Project caused by technical shortcomings inherent to the workings of the Internet, outside the Company and beyond its control, can justify a refusal of payment of any kind by Users, nor give rise to any indemnification in any form.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Company may not be held responsible if the Site fails to function, is impossible to access or is difficult to use if such conditions are attributable to unsuitable equipment, internal dysfunctions with the User's access provider, inappropriate use of the Site or Services by the User or excessive traffic on the Internet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Company declines all responsibility for any damage or loss connected with the use or impossibility of using the Site or its content, apart from exceptions stipulated by law.</p>8.2 Modification of the Site<p>It is understood the Site\u2019s contents are open, not fixed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This means that any information contained on the Site may be modified at any time, given the interactive nature of the Site, without this incurring the Company's responsibility.</p>8.3 Availability of the Site<p>The Company is bound by a best-endeavours obligation to provide the Services.\nIt thus declines all responsibility for any unavailability, suspension or interruption of the Site or Services that arise during operations involving the maintenance, upgrading of hardware or software or emergency repairs to the Site, or due to circumstances beyond the Company's control (including but not limited to technical faults or failures in telecommunication connections or equipment).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Company makes every reasonable effort to limit these disturbances insofar as they are attributable to it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition, the Company may not be held responsible for indirect or unforeseeable damage within the meaning of articles 1150 and 1151 of the Civil Code.</p>\n<p>Pursuant to article 1992 of the Civil Code, the Company's responsibility may only be incurred in the event of wilful misrepresentation or misconduct in its management.</p>8.4 Use of the Site<p>The Company wishes to draw the attention of Project Owners, Ululers and Users to the fact that by using the Site or the Services and/or publishing content and information on the Site, certain actions carried out on the Site and certain information published will be public and accessible to everybody.\nThe company thus enjoins Project Owners, Ululers and Users to be careful as regards the possible consequences of such disclosure, particularly as regards their privacy (for example, in a Project description or when making a Contribution to a Project).\nFor further information, please see the &nbsp.\nUlule Privacy Policy .</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once such information is published, the Company cannot be held responsible for the consequences of its disclosure.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Company wishes to draw the attention of Project Owners, Ululers and Users to the fact that in publishing content and information on the Site, they may be led to disclose personal data concerning third parties to the Company and/or the public.\nThe Cmpany thus enjoins Project Owners, Ululers and Users to be careful as regards the possible consequences of such disclosure, for which they are solely responsible.\nThey should therefore ensure that they have the right to disclose such information.\nFor further information, please see the &nbsp.\nUlule Privacy Policy .</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once these data have been communicated, the Company cannot be held responsible for the consequences of their disclosure.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The information provided by Users, Ululers and Project Owners must be true, accurate and not misleading.\nThe consequences of its disclosure on their privacy and/or that of third parties are the sole responsibility of the Users, Ululers and Project Owners concerned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We would remind you that Users

responsible for all the terms and conditions for executing Projects with regard to Ululers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Consequently, Ululers should only address questions or claims to Project Owners.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Project Owners guarantee and undertake to indemnify the Company for any damage suffered by the latter, and to hold it harmless against any action for damages instigated against it by a User, or more generally by a third party, as regards the infringement of any rights resulting from the publication and execution of a Project on the Site.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Likewise, the Company has no obligation to provide advice in the context of these Terms and Conditions.\nNor may the Company be held responsible in any way for the consequences of Contributions made by Ululers.\nThe Company\u2019s role with Project Owners is limited to assisting them in the presentation and promotion of their Projects.</p>8.6 Disputes between web users<p>The Company declines all responsibility if a dispute arises between Users and/or Visitors and/or Project Owners who have made contact with each other on the Site.</p>8.7 Hypertext links<p>The Site contains links to third party websites.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These linked sites are not under the Company's control, and it is not responsible for their content.\nThe Company provides these links for convenience, but a link does not imply that the Company sponsors or recommends the linked site in question, or that the Company is affiliated with it.</p>\n<p>Linked sites are owned and operated by independent retailers or service providers, and consequently, the Company cannot guarantee that Users will be satisfied with their products, services or commercial practices.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is Users' responsibility to make all the verifications they consider necessary or appropriate before carrying out any transactions with one of these third

contents relating to other Users in any way other than the strict requirements of using the Services for personal and private purposes.</p>Article 10.\nSuspension and interruption of the Services<p>Without this involving an obligation to check the content, accuracy and consistency of contents, the Company has the right to refuse the insertion of a project with regard to press and publication standards.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Company is at liberty to delete or modify, before or after its distribution, any content on the Site that does not reflect the content normally expected or the Site's editorial line, or which infringes current laws and regulations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To this end, the Company has the right to use electronic surveillance to detect contentious contents and penalise their authors, including excluding them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Company reserves the right to suspend or limit access to services for which Users have registered,

is the advantage of seeing and receiving Ulule advertising content based on your interests?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You would probably prefer to see and receive offers for products and services that correspond to your interests rather than ones that are of no interest to you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our aim is to show and send you the most relevant advertising material and communications possible.\nTo this end, cookies technology enables us to determine in real time which content should be displayed on a device or sent to an individual, based on the information we hold about the device and recipient.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If your device is used by more than one person or if more than one browser is used on the same device, we cannot ensure that the advertising content for your device or which is sent to you by email corresponds to your own use of this device and not that of another user.\nYou are wholly responsible for deciding whether or not to share use of your device with others and for browser settings regarding cookies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What data is used to adapt the advertising displayed on your device to your interests?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We may, subject to your preferences, associate browsing information related to your device, processed by the cookies we use, with the information we lawfully hold about you, in order to send you Ulule advertising or promotional emails, for example, or to display Ulule advertising content on your device that is adapted to your interests.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can, at any time, ask to no longer receive advertising or promotional emails adapted to your interests by contacting us directly and free-of-charge at privacy@ulule.fr or by using the \"unsubscribe\" link found in all promotional and advertising emails.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can, at any moment, ask to no longer see advertising content adapted to your interests by disabling the use of these cookies (see below for information on how to disable cookies).\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>How can I manage and disable the use of cookies?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By continuing to browse any other pages on our websites, you consent to the use of these cookies on these sites.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you wish, however, you can disable the use of cookies or, after agreeing to their use, partially or in whole withdraw this consent by

be stored temporarily in a dedicated area of your device.\nOnly the issuer of these cookies will be able to read them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you do not agree to this storage or reading, or if you delete the cookies stored on your device, this may affect the normal functioning of our sites.\nThis may be the case when you try to access your account, which requires us being able to identify you and enable you to stay logged in whilst navigating between pages.\nThis may also be the case if we or our service providers are unable to identify, for the purposes of technical accounting, the type of browser used by your device, its language and display settings, or the country from which your device appears to be connected to the internet.\nWhere applicable, we accept no responsibility for any consequences linked to the reduced functioning of our sites resulting from our inability to save or view cookies which you have disabled or deleted and which are required for their proper functioning.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With this in mind, you can at any moment express or modify your preferences regarding cookies using the methods described below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1.\nBrowser preferences</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your browser settings can be configured to disable the use of certain cookies or similar technologies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can configure your browser so that cookies are saved on your device or refused, either systematically or based on the issuer.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can also configure your browser so that you are asked whether or not to accept

browser are different.\nPlease see your browser's help menu to find out how to change your cookies preferences.\nFor example, for the most well-known browsers, see:</p>\n<p>\u2212 Internet

crowdfunding platform.\nIt puts project creators (\"project owners\") in contact with people wishing to support projects by making a financial contribution (\"contributors\").\nWithin the framework of these activities, we process personal data concerning you, whether you are a visitor to the website&nbsp;Ulule.com&nbsp;or a user (registered member, contributor or project owner).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2212 &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nThe data processing manager is Ulule, a simplified joint-stock company with an authorised capital of \u20ac253,061, registered under number 794 710 830 in the Paris trade and companies register, having its head office at 10 rue Penthi\u00e8vre 75008 Paris, FRANCE.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2212 &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nWe collect and process your data in order to: manage our contractual and pre-contractual relations with users and future users, manage user accounts, enable the hosting and administration of fundraising events, commercial management and user relations, provide our services, including the user support service, promote our services and products and propose new services and products to you, carry out training and events linked with our services and products, manage the&nbsp;Ulule.com&nbsp;websites, host and manage opinions and comments, host and manage the Community forum, compile commercial performance statistics, analyse and follow the audiences of our sites and facilitate their browsing as well as those of our dedicated pages on the social media (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube), combat fraud, money laundering and the financing of terrorism, manage any outstanding payments, pre-litigation and litigation cases, manage the exercise of your rights, and manage any reports and notifications linked with content published on our websites or forum.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2212 &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nCertain data concerning you may be combined.&nbsp;This may consist of data you communicate when using our&nbsp;Ulule.com&nbsp;websites and data gathered through cookies on the Internet (we invite you to read our Cookies Policy).\nData combined in this way are then used for some of the above-mentioned purposes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2212 &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nSome data is processed to make decisions as to the acceptance/refusal of a project or contribution.\nIn connection with their legal obligation to combat fraud, money laundering and financing of terrorism, Ulule and its payment service providers (MANGOPAY and STRIPE) process data, including data combinations, to help their staff establish fraud risk levels concerning payments and fundraising events.\nThis processing may be used to justify a decision taken by Ulule or MANGOPAY or STRIPE to refuse a fundraising event, but no decision is made without human intervention.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2212 &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nIt can happen that you communicate so-called sensitive data on our sites: when you publish a project, fill in your user profile, participate in a project, or publish a comment or an article on our Community Forum, you can publicly&nbsp;reveal highly personal information (religious or philosophical convictions, sexual preference, political opinions, state of health, etc.).&nbsp;We thus recommend extreme caution when you describe your project or user profile, post comments or articles on the forum or participate in a project, in order to protect your privacy.\nIt is also possible in certain cases to make \"anonymous\" contributions (see our online aid concerning this point&nbsp;\u2013 your identity will only be known to Ulule and the project owner concerned).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2212 &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nAs a project owner, in particular, you may communicate information concerning third parties (your staff, a person your project is designed to help, etc.).&nbsp;The processing of these data must comply with the regulations.\nYou should check that you have the right to communicate these data to Ulule and to the public (for example, by obtaining the written agreement of these third parties) and communicate information to these parties on Ulule's processing of the data as indicated in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2212 &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nIt is obligatory to collect certain data.\nWe need certain information to provide you with our services.\nWhenever we collect data through forms, the obligatory or optional nature of your answers is made clear in each form.\nThe consequences of not providing an answer for an obligatory response depend on the situation.\nIt will mainly mean that you cannot create an account, submit or contribute to a project, or benefit from some of our services (the requirement to provide information is contractual or regulatory in this case if the information required is connected with our legal obligations as a crowdfunding platform), and that we cannot meet requests from you concerning the exercise of your rights (the requirement to provide information in this case is regulatory).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2212 &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nThe parties who may receive data from Ulule&nbsp;are mainly our subcontractors, project owners, Ulule partners, if your project is participating in a partner operation, and the judicial and administrative authorities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2212 &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nYou have rights.\nThese consist of the right to access, correct , delete and restrict processing, the right to object to the processing of your data, the right to define, modify and revoke instructions governing what happens to your data after your death, and the right to lodge a complaint with the CNIL (French data protection authority).\nSubject to providing proof your identity and complying with the conditions imposed by current legislation, you can exercise these rights by writing to us at the following email address: privacy@ulule.com&nbsp;onto this postal address: ULULE SAS, 10 rue Penthi\u00e8vre 75008 Paris, FRANCE.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2212 &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;The periods for which we store your data vary according to the nature of the data concerned, the purposes for which they were collected and the legal limitation period (generally five years from the time when persons wishing to exercise a right have had or should have had knowledge of the facts enabling them to exercise the right), except in the case of pre-litigation or litigation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2212 &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Your data may be transferred outside the European Union.&nbsp;We will transfer certain data to our subcontractors, partners or service providers, such as our hosters, email dispatch management tools, etc.\nIf they are transferred outside the European Union, we make every effort to ensure that they

caution when writing your comments or publications on the Community forum, to protect your privacy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT \u2013 THIRD-PARTY DATA</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When you write a
