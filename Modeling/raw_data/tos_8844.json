associated with you.\nThe third party does not receive any information about the sender, and the images they process are immediately deleted.</p>\n<p>If you report a bug through the app and you are logged into your Maplesoft account at that time, this bug report will be associated with you.\nIf the problem involves pictures taken using the app, the image(s) you took and their mathematical interpretation are sent to Maplesoft for analysis, and may be shared with a third party for further investigation.\nYour identity will not be shared with a third party.\n</p>\n<p>The app collects usage and system information, which will be associated with your Maplesoft account if you are logged in.\nThis data is used for development purposes, such as identifying areas for improvement and
