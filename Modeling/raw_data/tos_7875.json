necessary to participate in certain activities, you may not be able to participate in those activities on certain Sites and/or Services.\n<br>\n<br> We may receive information through a variety of

requested.\nThese uses may include providing you with more effective customer service.\nmaking the sites or services easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same

or through passive means to provide you with various ways to connect and share content (e.g., web content, user-generated videos, text, drawings, and screen and lecture captures, and quizzing features, media, tools, services and other products) with third-party.\nFor example, we may provide you with the opportunity to email a link to certain content to another person.\nTo use this feature, we may require you to provide certain Personal Information including your email address and the email address of each person to whom you send the link.\n<br>\n<br> We also may allow you to share links

while online will help reduce the amount of unsolicited email you receive.\n<br>\n<br> 4.\nThird-party Login Functionality <br> We may permit users with accounts on certain third-party services, including but not limited to, social networking, search, sharing, and other services delivered by third-parties, to bypass the standard applicable registration process.\nIf you connect through an authorized third-party service, you will be able to use your third-party login information to log in to your Glarysoft account or access Glarysoft content, Sites and/or Services.\nWe are not responsible for the sharing, posting, commenting, or other content and information gathering practices of any third-party services that may be triggered by using these third-party login

except to the extent that Glarysoft may collect limited personal information from students (but not their email addresses), but only where that student's school or school district, has contracted with Glarysoft to collect the personal information from students for the educational context authorized by the school or school district.\nChildren under 16 years old are not allowed to create an account without a parent's or guardian's express consent.\nWe recommend that minors over the age of 16 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.\n<br>\n<br> We require schools or school districts to obtain parental or guardian consent from a student's parent or guardian before collecting any such student Personal Information.\nIf you are a student, please do not send any Personal Information about yourself to us, other than what we request from you when you sign up for any of our Sites and/or Services.\nIn the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a student without parental or guardian consent being obtained by his or her school or school district, or if we learn a student has provided us Personal Information beyond what we request when he or she signs up for any of our Sites and/or Services, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.\nIf you believe that a student may have provided us Personal Information beyond what is requested when signing up for any of our Sites and/or Services, or that a student's school or school district has not obtained parental or guardian consent, please contact us at support@glarysoft.com.\n<br>\n<br> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Policy, if you are a student as described above, and your parent or guardian signed up for our Sites and/or Service with a password or access ID provided by your school, you understand that your parent or guardian may be able to view all information within or associated with your account, including, without limitation, messages between you and your teacher and grades you received on your assignment.\n<br>\n<br> 7.\nNotification in the event of a breach <br> In the unlikely event of a breach in the security of personal data, we will notify all users who are actually or potentially affected.\n<br>\n<br> We may tailor the method of notice depending on the circumstances.\nWhere the only contact information that we have for you is an email address, then the notification will necessarily be by email.\nWe may also elect to give you notice via our in-product messaging system.\nWhere we believe there are affected users for which we have no contact information on file, we may give notice via publication on our company website.\n<br>\n<br> We reserve the right to delay notification if we are asked to do so by law enforcement or other authorities, or if we believe that giving notice immediately will increase the risk of harm to our user body overall.\n<br>\n<br> 8.\nInternational Transfers of Your Personal Data <br> We are a global business that provides its products and services all around the world.\nIn order to reach all of our users and provide all of them with our software, we operate on an infrastructure that spans the globe.\nThe servers that are part of this infrastructure may therefore be located in a country different than the one where you live.\nRegardless, we provide the same GDPR-level of protection to all personal data it processes.\n<br>\n<br> At the same time, when we transfer personal data outside of the EEA, we always make sure to put in place appropriate and suitable safeguards, such as standardized contracts approved by the European Commission, which legally bind the receiving party to adhere to a high level of protection, and to ensure that your data remains safe and secure at all times and that your rights are protected.\n<br>\n<br> Situations where we transfer personal data outside of the EEA include the provision of our products and services, processing of transactions and your payment details, and the provision of support services.\n<br>\n<br> 9.\nData Protection Officer <br> To protect user data security, we have a Data Protection Officer (DPO) to monitor our protection of user data, provide advice as required and cooperate with regulatory agencies.\nYou can contact our data protection officer at support@glarysoft.com.\n<br>\n<br> 10.\nChanges and Updates to This Policy <br> We may update this Policy from time to time.\nIf we do, we will update the \"effective date\" at the top of the Policy.\nIf we make material changes to how we use Personal Information, we will attempt to notify you of the change and to give you the opportunity to exercise choice as to how your Personal Information is used.\nWe will post the updated Policy on the affected Sites and/or Service, and if we have your email address, we will send notice of the update to that email address.\n<br>\n<br> We encourage you to review this Policy periodically to stay informed about our collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information.\nYour continued use of our Sites and/or Services or any other content, products or other services covered by this Policy constitutes your agreement to this Policy and any updates.\n<br>\n<br> 11.\nNo Error Free Performance <br> Glarysoft does not guarantee error-free performance under this Privacy Policy.\nGlarysoft will use reasonable efforts to comply with this Privacy Policy and will take prompt corrective action when Glarysoft
