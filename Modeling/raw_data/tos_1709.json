objects, usually a graphic image such as a transparent one pixel-by-one-pixel GIF, that are placed on a web page, advertisement, or in an email message.\nThe GIF may tell us the IP address of the device that fetched our page, the URL of the page the GIF is on, the time the page was viewed, the type of browser used, and it can also identify a previously set cookie value, and how and where a user accessed a website.\nWe may use this information to count visitors across our Service and understand how they navigate and use our Service.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Location-Identifying

technologies collect audio through the microphone on your device to effectuate an instruction or request by you.\nWe only collect audio with your consent.\nWe only maintain the audio long enough to

analytics.</li>\n<li>\n<b>App-Specific Technologies</b>.\nOur apps include app-specific technologies, such as SDKs and APIs provided by third parties.\nAn SDK is code embedded in an app that sends

Id.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For further information on how we use Tracking Technologies and your rights and choices regarding them, please see the sections entitled&nbsp;<b>Social Media and

its Service to be appropriate for a wide range of audiences and not directed to children under 13 (\u201cChildren\u201d or \u201cChild\u201d).\nIn general, Children may access the Service only if Wizards has obtained prior verifiable parental consent from their parent or guardian in compliance with the U.S.\nChildren\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Rule (\u201cCOPPA\u201d).\nIf you are a parent or guardian, please discuss this Privacy Policy with your Children so that they will better understand how to use the Service and the information they may be asked to provide when using the Service.\nIf you have any questions or comments about how we treat Children\u2019s information or our compliance with COPPA, please contact us as set forth in the section entitled&nbsp;<b>Contact Us&nbsp;</b>below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If your child is a California resident, review the section entitled&nbsp;<b>Additional Disclosures for California Residents</b>.\nIf your child is in the

Children</b>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Wizards may also offer certain areas of the Service that are identified as for Children and on such special areas of our Service we will either provide direct notice to a parent of our collection and use of Children\u2019s personal information as defined by COPPA and obtain prior verifiable parental consent or limit our data collection activities to comply with the obligations of COPPA for Child-directed services.\nFor a list of services that Wizards treats as being directed to Children under COPPA, please contact us as set forth in the section entitled&nbsp;<b>Contact Us</b>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<b>Collection, Use, and Sharing of Children's Information</b>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Wizards may collect, use, and share personal information from Children if it is submitted by a Child with prior verifiable parental consent or by the parent or guardian of the Child.\nTo determine who is younger than 13 years old and whether prior verifiable parental consent is required, we ask all users who wish to register to submit their date of birth.\nThose users that indicate they are Children are either blocked from the activity or taken through a parental consent process.\nAs part of the parental consent process, parents have the choice of consenting to our collection and internal use of their Child\u2019s personal information but prohibiting us from disclosing that information to third parties (except to the extent such disclosure is integral to our Service).\nIf we learn or have reason to suspect that we have collected information from a Child in violation of COPPA, we will promptly delete it.</p>\n<p>In limited circumstances, in accordance with COPPA, Wizards does not require verifiable parental consent prior to collection, use, or sharing of Children\u2019s personal information.\nFor example, Wizards may collect and store persistent identifiers (e.g., cookies, IP addresses, etc.) from Children without prior verifiable parental consent where we collect no other Children\u2019s personal information and such persistent identifiers are collected solely for the purpose of providing support for the internal operations of the Service.</p>\n<p>Subject to our compliance with COPPA, Wizards may collect personal information from Children for any of the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy and may use, share, and otherwise process such information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.\nWe take reasonable measures to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of Children\u2019s personal information, including by taking reasonable steps to release such information only to parties capable of maintaining its confidentiality and security.\nWe retain Children\u2019s personal information only as long as is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected and delete such information using reasonable measures to protect against its unauthorized access or use.</p>\n<p>Please refer to the sections entitled&nbsp;<b>Information Collection</b>,&nbsp;<b>Information Use</b>, and&nbsp;<b>Sharing of Information&nbsp;</b>for further details on how we process

whether the dispute or claim is based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, unfair competition, misrepresentation or any other legal doctrine.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>20.2.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Initiating Arbitration.</strong> You and Wizards agree to make reasonable, good faith efforts to informally resolve any dispute before initiating arbitration.\nIf a party who intends to seek arbitration must, they must first send the other a written notice that describes the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and sets forth the relief sought.\nIf we do not reach an agreement to resolve the dispute within forty-five (45) days after the notice is received, the party seeking redress may commence an arbitration.&nbsp;You may initiate an arbitration proceeding by sending Wizards a written notice explaining the claim and what remedy you want from Wizards.\nIf you initiate arbitration against Wizards, you must send a copy to Wizards at the following address: Wizards of the Coast LLC, ATTN: Legal Department, 1600 Lind Avenue, Ste.\n400, Renton, Washington.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>20.3.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Arbitration administration.</strong>&nbsp;Disputes will be settled by binding individual arbitration conducted by the Judicial Arbitration Mediation Services, Inc.\n(\u201c<strong>JAMS</strong>\u201d) subject to the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law and according to the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures effective July 1, 2014 (You agree that the arbitration shall be administered by&nbsp;JAMS&nbsp;in the Seattle, Washington area residents of North and South America.\nJapan, for residents of Asia.\nand in London for residents of Europe and Africa.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>20.4.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Arbitration Process</strong>.</p>\n<p>The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators and mutually agreed upon by the parties.\nThe determination of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by an arbitrator rather than a court.\nJAMS will administer the arbitration and it will be conducted in the English language.\nIt may be conducted through the submission of documents, by phone, or in person at a mutually agreed location.\nThe arbitration hearing must commence within thirty (30) days from the appointment of the arbitrator, unless otherwise agreed to by you and Wizards.\nJAMS will only have power to arbitrate the dispute between you and us and not in relation to other people under this particular arbitration.\nJudgment upon an award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>20.5.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Arbitration Confidentiality.</strong>&nbsp;You and Wizards agree that any dispute, claim or controversy that has been submitted to arbitration, and all related proceedings including any settlement agreement, shall be kept confidential.\nHowever, the prevailing party in any arbitration may file the arbitration award with any court of competent jurisdiction to have that award confirmed in a court order or judgment.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>20.6.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Arbitration Costs.</strong>&nbsp;Your responsibility to pay any JAMS filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the JAMS Rules and pursuant to applicable law.\nHowever, if your claim for damages does not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10, 000.00 USD), Wizards will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your demand for arbitration was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).\nIn the event any litigation is brought by either party in connection with this User Agreement, the prevailing party in such litigation shall be entitled to recover from the other party all the reasonable costs, attorneys' fees and other expenses incurred by such prevailing party in the litigation.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>20.7.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Additional Terms</strong>.\nYou also agree that: (i) no finding or stipulation of fact in any other arbitration, judicial or similar proceeding may be given preclusive or collateral estoppel effect in any arbitration hereunder (unless determined in another proceeding between the parties).\nand (ii) and no conclusion of law in any other arbitration may be given any weight in any arbitration hereunder (unless determined in another proceeding between the parties).</p>\n<p>YOU AND WIZARDS BOTH UNDERSTAND THAT, ABSENT THIS ARVITRATION PROVISION, WE WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.\nWe further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation.\nHowever, the arbitrator shall have the authority to shift such fees and costs to ensure that you do not pay significant forum fees.\nIn addition, you shall not be required to pay any type of fee or cost in arbitration that you would not have had to pay had you been free to file your claim in court.\nDiscovery may be more limited in arbitration than in a court, but each side will be permitted discovery sufficient to present or defend their claims.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>20.8.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Waiver of Collective Action (aka Class Action) Remedies.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, you and Wizards agree not under any circumstances to bring or participate in a class or representative action, private attorney general action or collective arbitration.\nYou and we agree that to the fullest extent permitted by law: (i) no arbitration shall be joined with any other, including without limitation any arbitration involving any other current or former customer, end user or licensee of Wizards, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise.\n(ii) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures.\nand (iii) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>\n<p>If the agreement in this Section 20.7 not to bring or participate in a class or representative action, private attorney general action or collective arbitration is found unenforceable, you and Wizards agree that it will not be severable: this entire section will be deemed unenforceable and any claim or dispute will therefore be resolved in Arbitration as outlined above.\nThe arbitrator may also award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party\u2019s individual claim(s).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>21.\nAlpha/Beta Tests</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>21.1.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Alpha/Beta Tests.</strong>&nbsp;From time
