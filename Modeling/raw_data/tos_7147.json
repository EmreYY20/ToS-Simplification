Pricing Tiers included on these Terms of Service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.5 Late Payment.</strong> If any undisputed amounts invoiced hereunder as Fees or otherwise are not received by Osano by the due date, then at Osano\u2019s discretion, such charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 12% per year or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from the date such payment was due until the date paid.\nIn addition, upon 30 days\u2019 written notice to Customer provided after the due date of any undisputed fees, Osano may suspend Customer\u2019s access to the Services, if any,

Confidential Information (as defined below) of the other Party for any purpose outside of the scope of this Agreement, and each Party shall limit access to Confidential Information to those of its, or its Affiliates\u2019, employees, contractors, and agents who need such access for purposes consistent with this Agreement and who have signed confidentiality agreements with the receiving Party

the receiving party will (if permitted to do so) provide the discloser with notice of such circumstances and will limit such disclosure to the required disclosure.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.2 Security Requirements.</strong> Osano has implemented technical and organizational security measures consistent with the standards, practices, and controls cited in its then-current SOC 2 report.\nHowever, Osano cannot guarantee that unauthorized third-parties will never be able to defeat those measures and expressly denies any responsibility for damages, monetary or otherwise, resulting from unauthorized third-party access to Customer\u2019s account or use, alteration, or disclosure of the Customer Information or Usage Data except in the event of Osano' gross negligence or willful misconduct.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.3 Multi-Factor Authentication.</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication is a security system that requires more than one level of authentication before accounts can be accessed.\nIt was developed to add extra security steps to the login process, to keep accounts safe and verify users before they can gain access to accounts.\nUsers that provide their mobile phone numbers for authentication purposes agree to receive an SMS message as part of the process.\nCarrier message and data rates may apply.</p> 6.\nTerm and Termination.\n<p>\n<strong>6.1 Term of

Services by providing Customer written notice thereof (which notice may be provided by email) at least 30 days prior to the end of the then-current term.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>6.3 Termination for Cause.</strong> Either Party may terminate this Agreement for cause (i) upon 30 days' written notice to the other Party of a material breach if such breach remains uncured at the expiration of such

automatic account provisioning through the Order Form available at https://www.osano.com/plans (or any other page on this website) Osano may terminate this Agreement for convenience upon 60 days\u2019 written notice to the Customer.\nIn the event of Osano\u2019s termination for convenience, Osano will issue the Customer a pro-rata refund of Fees paid for Services not rendered.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.5 Effects of Termination.</strong> Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, all Order Forms will automatically terminate and: (i) Customer will immediately cease all use of the Services.\n(ii) Customer will have no further access to its Customer account provided by Osano, and (iii) Customer will pay Osano all unpaid Fees owing to Osano.\nIf Customer terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.3, Osano will refund to Customer any unearned Fees that Customer paid in advance for the Services.\nIf Osano terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.3, then, without limiting any other remedies that may be available, Customer will pay any unpaid Fees covering the remainder of the term of each Order Form after the date of termination.\nIn no event will termination relieve Customer of its obligation to pay any amounts and Fees payable to Osano for the period prior to the date of termination and other obligations that survive termination of this Agreement.\nAt such time that all unpaid Fees owing to Osano have been received by Osano, Osano shall return to Customer all Customer Information and Usage Data in a form to be agreed upon by the parties at no additional charge to Customer.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>6.6 Survival.</strong> Any provision of this Agreement that, either by its terms or to give effect to its meaning, must survive, and such other provisions that expressly or by their nature are intended to survive termination shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\nWithout limiting the foregoing, Section 4.1 as well as Articles 3, 5, 7-10 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.</p> 7.\nWarranties and Warranty Disclaimer.\n<p>\n<strong>7.1 Mutual Warranties.</strong> Each Party represents and

such terms are defined under the General Data Protection Regulation((EU) 2016/679)(\u201cGDPR\u201d) and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (\u201cUK GDPR\u201d), and any replacements, additions, successors, implementing requirements or legislation or amendments thereto.\nIn some circumstances, Customer may be a Processor, in which case Customer appoints Osano as Customer\u2019s Subprocessor, which shall not change the obligations of either party under this DPA.</li>\n<li>Customer\u2019s Processing of Personal Data.\n\u201cPersonal Data\u201d and \u201cProcessing\u201d will have the same meaning as set forth in the GDPR.\nCustomer shall, in the use of the Services (which are defined in the Agreement), Process Personal Data in accordance with the requirements of all applicable data protection laws.\nTo the extent Customer acquires Personal Data, Customer shall have sole responsibility for the legality of Personal Data and the means by which Customer acquired Personal

provide Services under the Agreement.&nbsp.\nOsano\u2019s Subprocessors are identified in Osano's GDPR statement.</li>\n<li>Prior to a Subprocessor\u2019s Processing of Personal Data, Osano will require contractual obligations of the Subprocessor that are substantially the same as those imposed on Osano under this DPA, including in relation to appropriate technical and organizational data security measures.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Osano remains liable for its Subprocessors\u2019 performance under this DPA to the same extent Osano is liable for its own performance.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Other than those Subprocessors listed above, Osano may only authorize any additional Subprocessors to Process Personal Data on its behalf after notifying Customer in advance in writing of its intention to utilize such Subprocessor.</li>\n<li>Customer may object to Osano\u2019s use of a new Subprocessor by notifying Osano promptly in writing within 14 days of receipt of written notice.\nAfter receiving an objection to the use of a new Subprocessor, Osano will work with Customer to determine the appropriate course of action.\nShould Osano not be able to provide a viable solution to alleviate Customer\u2019s concerns within 14 days, Customer may terminate the Agreement without further liability and will be refunded any pre-paid unused fees.</li>\n</ol> Security <ol>\n<li>Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of Processing, as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, Osano shall in relation to Personal Data implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including, as appropriate, the measures referred to in Article 32(1) of the GDPR, including as appropriate:</li>\n<ol>\n<li>the pseudonymisation and encryption of Personal Data;</li>\n<li>the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;</li>\n<li>the ability to restore the availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident.\nand</li>\n<li>a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of the security measures.</li>\n</ol>\n<li>In assessing the appropriate level of security, Osano shall consider the risks that are presented by Processing, in particular from a Personal Data Breach.\n\u201cPersonal Data Breach\u201d will have the same meaning as set forth in the GDPR.</li>\n<li>Osano shall notify Customer without undue delay, but in no event longer than 72 hours, upon becoming aware of:</li>\n<ol>\n<li>the loss, unintended destruction or damage, corruption, or unusability of part or all of the Personal Data.</li>\n<li>any accidental, unauthorised or unlawful processing of the Personal Data.\nor</li>\n<li>a Personal Data Breach or suspected Personal Data Breach affecting Customer Personal Data.</li>\n</ol>\n<li>Where Osano becomes aware of Clause 3 (a), Clause 3 (b) and/or Clause 3 (c) above, it shall, without undue delay, also provide the Customer with the following information:</li>\n<ol>\n<li>description of the nature of Clause 3 (a), Clause 3 (b) and/or Clause 3 (c), including the categories of in-scope Personal Data and

Personal Data processing or Personal Data Breach, Osano will investigate the matter.\nFurther, Osano will reasonably co-operate with the Customer including but not limited to:</li>\n<ol>\n<li>assisting with any investigation;</li>\n<li>making available all relevant records, logs, files, data reporting and other materials required to comply with all data protection legislation or as otherwise reasonably requested by the Customer;</li>\n<li>restoring such Personal Data at its own expense as soon as possible.\nand</li>\n<li>taking reasonable and prompt steps to mitigate the effects and to minimize any damage resulting from the Personal Data Breach or accidental, unauthorised or unlawful Personal Data processing.</li>\n</ol>\n<li>Osano will not inform any third party of any accidental, unauthorised or unlawful processing of all or part of the Personal Data and/or a Personal Data Breach without first obtaining the Customer's prior written consent, except when required to do so by law.</li>\n<li>Osano agrees that the Customer has the sole right to determine whether to provide notice of the accidental, unauthorised or unlawful processing and/or the Personal Data Breach to any Data Subjects, the relevant Supervisory Authority, other in-scope regulators, law enforcement agencies or others, as required by law or regulation or in the Customer's discretion, including the contents and delivery method of the notice.\n\u201cSupervisory Authority\u201d will have the same meaning as set forth in the GDPR.</li>\n</ol> Rights of Data Subjects <ol>\n<li>\u201cData Subject\u201d will have the same meaning as set forth in the GDPR.\nTaking into account the nature of the Processing, Osano shall assist Customer by implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as possible, for the fulfillment of Customer\u2019s obligations, to enable Customer to respond to requests to exercise Data Subject rights under applicable data protection laws, including subject access rights, the rights to rectify, port and erase personal data, object to the processing and automated processing of personal data, and restrict the processing of personal data and to comply with information or assessment notices served on the Customer by the relevant Supervisory Authority under data protection legislation.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Osano shall:\n<ol>\n<li>Promptly notify Customer if it receives a request from a Data Subject under any applicable data protection laws in respect of Customer Personal Data and/or any complaint, notice or communication that relates directly or indirectly to the processing of the Personal Data or to either party's compliance with data protection legislation.\nand</li>\n<li>Ensure that it does not respond to any request from a Data Subject except on documented instructions of Customer or as required by applicable data protection laws to which Osano is subject, in which case, Osano shall, to the extent permitted by applicable data protection laws, inform Customer of that legal requirement before responding to the request.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol> Retention and Deletion of Customer Personal Data <ol>\n<li>Osano retains the minimum amount of Personal Data in order to provide its Services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Personal Data collected through Customer\u2019s use of Osano\u2019s Consent Management feature is de-identified encrypted and stored in order to allow the Customer to have a record of the consent choices made by individuals.&nbsp.\nPersonal Data collected through the Data Subject Access Request feature is also encrypted and assigned a unique identifier to record the processing of the request.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The retention period of Personal Data depends on which Osano feature was used in the processing activity.&nbsp.\nFor Osano\u2019s Consent Management and Data Subject Access Request features, the information is stored for the length of the Agreement as compliance records and for Osano\u2019s Data Discovery feature, the information is retained for seven (7) calendar days and then automatically deleted (the Customer may also manually delete the data within the Service at any time).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Upon termination of the Services for which Osano is Processing Personal Data, Osano shall, upon Customer\u2019s written request and subject to the limitations in the Agreement and unless prevented by applicable data protection laws, securely destroy any Customer Personal Data that has not already been deleted.</li>\n<li>If any law, regulation, or government or regulatory body requires Osano to retain any documents or materials or Personal Data that Osano would otherwise be required to return or destroy, it will notify the Customer in writing of that retention requirement, giving details of the documents, materials or Personal Data that it must retain, the legal basis for retention, and establishing a specific timeline for deletion or destruction once the retention requirement ends.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol> Data Protection Impact Assessment <ol>\n<li>Upon Customer\u2019s reasonable request, Osano shall provide Customer with commercially reasonable cooperation and assistance needed to fulfil Customer\u2019s obligation under the GDPR to carry out a data protection impact assessment related to Customer\u2019s use of the Services, to the extent Customer does not otherwise have access to the relevant information, and to the extent such information is available to Osano.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Osano shall provide commercially reasonable assistance to Customer in the cooperation or prior consultation with the Supervisory Authority to the extent required under the GDPR or other applicable data protection laws.</li>\n</ol> Audit Rights <ol>\n<li>Osano will permit the Customer or a representative to audit Osano\u2019s compliance with this DPA, on at least seven days' prior written notice.\nOsano will give the Customer all necessary assistance to conduct such audits.\nIf such an audit occurs, Customer shall bare all of its own costs of conducting the audit or those of its representative.\nThe assistance may include, but is not limited to:\n<ol>\n<li>remote electronic access to, and copies of the records and any other information held on systems storing the Personal Data;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>access to and meetings with any of Osano\u2019s personnel reasonably necessary to provide all explanations and perform the audit effectively.\nand</li>\n<li>inspection of all records and the infrastructure, electronic data or systems, facilities, equipment or application software used to store, process the Personal Data.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The notice requirements in Section 1 above will not apply if (i) the Customer reasonably believes that a Personal Data Breach occurred, (ii) Osano is in breach of any of its obligations under this DPA or any applicable data protection laws or (iii) if such audit is mandated by the relevant Supervisory Authority.</li>\n<li>If a Personal Data Breach occurs or is occurring or Osano becomes aware of a breach of any of its obligations under this DPA or any applicable data protection laws, Osano will:\n<ol>\n<li>Notify Customer promptly as detailed above;</li>\n<li>promptly conduct its own audit to determine the cause;</li>\n<li>remedy any deficiencies identified by the audit within thirty days.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol> Records <ol>\n<li>Osano will keep detailed, accurate and up-to-date written records regarding any processing of the Personal Data, including but not limited to, the access, control and security of the Personal Data, approved Subprocessors, the processing purposes, categories of processing, any transfers of personal data to a third country and related safeguards, and a general description of the technical and organisational security measures referred to in Clause 3.1 (\u201cRecords\u201d).</li>\n<li>Osano will ensure that the Records are sufficient to enable the Customer to verify Osano\u2019s compliance with its obligations under this DPA and Osano will provide the Customer with copies of the Records upon request.</li>\n<li>Osano must review the information listed in the Exhibits to this DPA at least once a year to confirm its current accuracy and suggest updates to it when required to reflect current practices.</li>\n</ol> Data Transfers <ol>\n<li>Osano (and any Subprocessor) will only transfer or otherwise process the Personal Data outside the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) or the United Kingdom subject to the Standard Contractual Clauses attached to this DPA.\n<ol>\n<li>Osano is processing the Personal Data in a territory that is subject to adequacy regulations under applicable data protection laws whereby the territory provides adequate protection for the privacy rights of individuals.\nOsano must identify in Exhibit 1 the territory that is subject to such adequacy regulations.\nor</li>\n<li>Osano participates in a valid cross-border transfer mechanism under applicable data protection laws, so that Osano (and, where appropriate, the Customer) can ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure an adequate level of protection with respect to the privacy rights of individuals as required by Article 46 of the GDPR.\nOsano must identify in Exhibit 1 the transfer mechanism that enables the parties to comply with these cross-border data transfer provisions and Osano must immediately inform the Customer of any change to that status or Osano may only process, or permit the processing, of the Personal Data outside the EEA if the transfer otherwise complies with applicable data protection laws for the reasons set out in Exhibit 1.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>If any Personal Data transfer between the Customer and Osano requires the execution of Standard Contractual Clauses (\u201cSCC\u201d) in order to comply with applicable data protection laws (where the Customer is the entity exporting Personal Data to Osano outside the EEA or the United Kingdom), the parties will complete all relevant details in and execute, the SCC contained in Exhibit 2, and take all other actions required to legitimize the transfer including, but not limited to, entering into any required transfer agreement required by the United Kingdom\u2019s ICO.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>If the Customer consents to the appointment by Osano of a Subprocessor located outside the EEA or the United Kingdom in compliance with the provisions of Clause 2, then the Customer authorizes Osano to enter into the SCC referenced in Exhibit 2 with the Subprocessor in Osano\u2019s name and on its behalf.\nOsano will make the executed Subprocessor agreement with SCC available to the Customer upon request.</li>\n<li>If and to the extent that any processing of Personal Data subject to the UK GDPR by Osano takes place in any country outside the UK whose laws do not provide an adequate level of data protection (and an independently valid transfer mechanism does not exist), or either party relies on a statutory mechanism to normalize international data transfers that is subsequently modified, revoked, or held in a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, then:&nbsp.\n<ol>\n<li>the parties will (i) utilize any duly approved successor mechanism.\nor (ii) cooperate in good faith to terminate the transfer or pursue a suitable alternate mechanism that can lawfully support the transfer.\nand</li>\n<li>the terms of the International Data Transfer Addendum to the EU SCCs issued by the UK Information Commissioner\u2019s Office pursuant to S119A(1) of the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (\u201cIDTA\u201d) (available at: https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/4019483/international-data-transfer-addendum.pdf) will apply in respect of that processing:\n<ol>\n<li>for purposes of Part I of the IDTA, the terms of this DPA, including the roles of the parties set forth in Annex I and the technical and organizational measures set out in Annex II, shall apply;</li>\n<li>both parties shall be allowed to end subscription to the IDTA as set out in Section 19 of the IDTA.\nand &nbsp;</li>\n<li>for purposes of Part 2 of the IDTA, the EU SCCs shall apply.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol> U.S.\nPrivacy Laws <p>The provisions of Exhibit 3 apply to the processing of Personal Data (as defined in Exhibit 3)

8 - Data Protection Safeguards\n<p>The data exporter warrants that it has used reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able, through the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, to satisfy its obligations under these Clauses.</p>\n8.1 Instructions\n<ol>\n<li>The data importer shall process the personal data only on documented instructions from the data exporter.\nThe data exporter may give such instructions throughout the duration of the contract.</li>\n<li>The data importer shall immediately inform the data exporter if it is unable to follow those instructions.</li>\n</ol>\n8.2 Purpose Limitation\n<p>The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B, unless on further instructions from the data exporter.</p>\n8.3 Transparency\n<p>On request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by the Parties, available to the data subject free of charge.\nTo the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including the measures described in Annex II and personal data, the data exporter may redact part of the text of the Appendix to these Clauses prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand the its content or exercise his/her rights.\nOn request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information.\nThis Clause is without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.</p>\n8.4 Accuracy\n<p>If the data importer becomes aware

certify to the data exporter that it has done so, or return to the data exporter all personal data processed on its behalf and delete existing copies.\nUntil the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses.\nIn case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit return or deletion of the personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the extent and for as long as required under that local law.\nThis is without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement for the data importer under Clause 14(e) to notify the data exporter throughout the duration of the contract if it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under Clause 14(a).</p>\n8.6 Security of processing\n<ol>\n<li>The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the data, including protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to that data (hereinafter \u2018personal data breach\u2019).\nIn assessing the appropriate level of security, the Parties shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subjects.\nThe Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner.\nIn case of pseudonymisation, the additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject shall, where possible, remain under the exclusive control of the data exporter.\nIn complying with its obligations under this paragraph, the data importer shall at least implement the technical and organisational measures specified in Annex II.\nThe data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.</li>\n<li>The data importer shall grant access to the personal data to members of its personnel only to the extent strictly necessary for the implementation, management and monitoring of the contract.\nIt shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.</li>\n<li>In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the breach, including measures to mitigate its adverse effects.\nThe data importer shall also notify the data exporter without undue delay after having become aware of the breach.\nSuch notification shall contain the details of a contact point where more information can be obtained, a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.\nWhere, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide all information at the same time, the initial notification shall contain the

responsible for any damage caused to the data subject as a result of a breach of these Clauses, all responsible Parties shall be jointly and severally liable and the data subject is entitled to bring an action in court against any of these Parties.</li>\n<li>The Parties agree that if one Party is held liable under paragraph (e), it shall be entitled to claim back from the other Party/ies that part

Local Laws and Obligations In Case of Access by Public Authorities Clause 14 - Local laws and practices affecting compliance with the Clauses\n<ol>\n<li>The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data importer, including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses.\nThis is based on the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.</li>\n<li>The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following elements:\n<ol>\n<li>the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used.\nintended onward transfers.\nthe type of recipient.\nthe purpose of processing.\nthe categories and format of the transferred personal data.\nthe economic sector in which the transfer occurs.\nthe storage location of the data transferred;</li>\n<li>the laws and practices of the third country of destination\u2013 including those requiring the disclosure of data to public authorities or authorising

organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the country of destination.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to provide the data exporter with relevant information and agrees that it will continue to cooperate with the data exporter in ensuring compliance with these Clauses.</li>\n<li>The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.</li>\n<li>The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a).</li>\n<li>Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g.\ntechnical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or data importer to address the situation.\nThe data exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by the competent supervisory authority to do so.\nIn this case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses.\nIf the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise.\nWhere the contract is terminated pursuant to this Clause, Clause 16(d) and (e) shall apply.</li>\n</ol>\nClause 15 - Obligations of the data importer in case of access by public authorities\n15.1 Notification\n<ol>\n<li>The data importer agrees

information about the personal data requested, the requesting authority, the legal basis for the request and the response provided.\nor</li>\n<li>becomes aware of any direct access by public authorities to personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses in accordance with the laws of the country of destination.\nsuch notification shall include all information available to the importer.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the data exporter and/or the data subject under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with a view to communicating as much information as possible, as soon as possible.\nThe data importer agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them on request of the data exporter.</li>\n<li>Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to provide the data exporter, at regular intervals for the duration of the contract, with as much relevant information as possible on the requests received (in particular, number of requests, type of data requested, requesting authority/ies, whether requests have been challenged and the outcome of such challenges, etc.).</li>\n<li>The data importer agrees to preserve the information pursuant to paragraphs (a) to (c) for the duration of the contract and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.</li>\n<li>Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligation of the data importer pursuant to Clause 14(e) and Clause 16 to inform the data exporter promptly where it is unable to comply with these Clauses.</li>\n</ol>\n15.2 Review of legality and data minimisation\n<ol>\n<li>The data importer agrees to review the legality of the request for disclosure, in particular whether it remains within the powers granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of the country of destination, applicable obligations under international law and principles of international comity.\nThe data importer shall, under the same conditions, pursue possibilities of appeal.\nWhen challenging a request, the data importer shall seek interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until the competent judicial authority has decided on its merits.\nIt shall not disclose the personal data requested until required to do so under the applicable procedural rules.\nThese requirements are without prejudice to the obligations of the data importer under Clause 14(e).</li>\n<li>The data importer agrees to

exporter.\nIt shall also make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.</li>\n<li>The data importer agrees to provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to a request for disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.</li>\n</ol> Section IV - Final Provisions Clause 16 - Non-compliance with the Clauses and termination\n<ol>\n<li>The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter if it is unable to comply with these Clauses, for whatever reason.</li>\n<li>In the event that the data importer is in breach of these Clauses or unable to comply with these Clauses, the data exporter shall suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until compliance is again ensured or the contract is terminated.\nThis is without prejudice to Clause 14(f).</li>\n<li>The data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these

reasonable time and in any event within one month of suspension;</li>\n<li>the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of these Clauses.\nor</li>\n<li>the data importer fails to comply with a binding decision of a competent court or supervisory authority regarding its obligations under these Clauses.</li>\n</ol>\nIn these cases, it shall inform the competent supervisory authority of such non-compliance.\nWhere the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise.</li>\n<li>Personal data that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant to paragraph (c) shall at the choice of the data exporter immediately be returned to the data exporter or deleted in its entirety.\nThe same shall apply to any copies of the data.\nThe data importer shall certify the deletion of the data to the data exporter.\nUntil the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses.\nIn case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit the return or deletion of the transferred personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process the data to the extent and for as long as required under that local law.</li>\n<li>Either Party may revoke its agreement to be bound by these Clauses where (i) the European Commission adopts a decision pursuant to Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the transfer of personal data to which these Clauses apply.\nor (ii) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 becomes part of the legal framework of the country to which the personal data is transferred.\nThis is without prejudice to other obligations applying to the processing in question under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.</li>\n</ol>\nClause 17 - Governing law\n<p>These Clauses shall be governed by the law of one of the EU Member States, provided such law allows for third-party beneficiary rights.\nThe Parties agree that this shall be the law of Ireland.</p>\nClause 18 - Choice of forum and
