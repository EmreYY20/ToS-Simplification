to, change, or erase their personal information as collected by Home Run Inn.\nCalifornia consumers are California residents who are either within California or outside of California on a temporary basis.\nCalifornia consumers includes direct customers, employees, and business to business customers.\nSee \u201c<u>Exercising Your Rights</u>\u201d below for further information.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<u>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability</u>: California residents have the right to request that Home Run Inn disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Information over the 12 months prior to the date of the inquiry.\nOnce we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose the categories of Personal Information we have collect about you and the category of the source of the Personal Information, our business or commercial purpose for collecting that Personal Information, the categories of third parties with whom we shared that Personal Information and the recipient category of any third party who received information for a business purpose, and a copy of the specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Right to Request Information About Disclosure to Third Parties</u>: You may request information about our disclose of personal information to third parties or affiliated companies for their direct marketing purposes.\nTo make such a request, please follow the instructions in the \u201c<u>Exercising Your Rights</u>\u201d section.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Deletion Request Rights</u>.\nYou have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.\nOnce we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete your Personal Information and direct our service providers to delete your Personal Information.\nThe following exceptions may apply, and we may deny your request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Information;</li>\n<li>Take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you;</li>\n<li>Perform our contract with you;</li>\n<li>Detect security incidents or protect against malicious or illegal activity;</li>\n<li>Comply with any other relevant California or federal law;</li>\n<li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us;</li>\n<li>Comply with a legal obligation.\nand/or,</li>\n<li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that Information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<u>Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</u>.\nYou have the right to direct us not to sell your personal information at any time (the \u201cright to opt out\u201d).\nThe law defines \u201csale\u201d more broadly than you may believe.\n\u201c<u>Sale</u>\u201d covers the transfer of Personal Information to any third party in exchange for valuable consumer information.\nWe do not transfer your information to third parties in exchange for money, but we may transfer Personal Information to third parties to operate our business.\nTo exercise the right to opt-out, you or your authorized representative may submit a request to us by filling out the California Consumer Privacy Act Opt-Out Form.\nOnce you make an opt-out request, we are required by law to wait at least 12 months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales, but you may change your mind and opt-in by emailing us.\nCustomers who opt-in may opt-out of future sales at any time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are some exceptions to opting out.\nWe can transfer data to a service provider even if you opt out.\nA service provider is a business that agrees not to use your information for any purpose other than providing the services specified in our contract, like a business partner that manages our data security.\nWe can also transfer your information to a third party if it is necessary to process an order or other transaction to which you have agreed and directed us to complete.\nCollecting information and using that information ourselves for internal, reasonable business activity is not a sale.\nIf you opt-out, we may still collect and process your Personal Information for our internal purposes.\nOpt-out also applies only to Personal Information.\ninformation that has been anonymized and aggregated is no longer Personal Information and opting out will not limit our ability to transfer this kind of data to third parties.</p>\n<p>There are also reasonable technical limitations on opting out.\nWhere we can reasonably determine that information relates to you, and you submit a verifiable consumer request to opt-out of data sales, we will not \u201csell\u201d it to third parties.\nHowever, if we are unable to determine that information relates to you, it will not be covered by an opt-out request.</p>\n<p>Opting out is not unsubscribing from marketing messages from us.\nPlease follow the unsubscribe link in any email communications from Home Run Inn to unsubscribe to email communications.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How Do I Exercise My Rights As A California Consumer?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you are a California Consumer, you have certain privacy rights under the CCPA.\nYou may only make two requests as described below over a 12-month period.\nTo exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights reserved to California consumers, a consumer may submit a verifiable consumer request by either:</p>\n<p>\u2013 Accessing our web form at https://www.homeruninnpizza.com/contact/.\nor</p>\n<p>\u2013 By physically mailing your request to:</p>\n<p>Home Run

to your Personal Information.\nYou may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.\nYou may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a one-year period.</p>\n<p>A verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information (or an authorized representative thereof) and must describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</p>\n<p>We cannot respond to a request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the Personal Information relates to you.</p>\n<p>We will endeavor to respond to all verifiable consumer requests within 45 days.\nIf we require more time, up to 90 days total, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your Nevada Privacy Rights</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Nevada law (NRS 603A.340) requires each business to establish a designated request address where Nevada consumers may submit requests directing the business not to sell certain kinds of personal information that the business has collected or will collect about the consumer.\nA sale under Nevada law is the exchange of personal information for monetary consideration by the business to a third party for the third party to license or sell the personal information to other third parties.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Security</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Home Run Inn maintains reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to help guard your information from loss,
