Introduction <i>\n</i>\n<p>We, ERAS, take the protection of your personal data very seriously and strictly adhere to the rules laid out by data protection laws and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR-EU and GDPR-UK).</p>\n<p>This privacy notice gives you information on how we collect and process your personal data through your use of this site and any data you may provide if you contact us regarding our products and services.</p>\n<p>We have appointed a data protection officer (DPO) who is responsible for monitoring and providing guidance with our GDPR status.\nIf you have any questions about this privacy notice, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, please contact the DPO using the contact information in section 15 of this privacy notice.</p> 2: Why We Collect Your Personal Information <i>\n</i>\n<p>We collect your personal data for one of the following purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To manage communications between you and us</li>\n<li>Where we need to perform the contract we have entered into with you</li>\n<li>To provide you with information you have requested or which we feel may be of interest to you</li>\n<li>To ensure the safe operation of our website and to monitor the performance of our website</li>\n<li>For marketing and advertising purposes</li>\n</ul> 3: Lawful Basis of Processing Information <i>\n</i>\n<p>We only collect and use

the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract</li>\n<li>If the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject</li>\n<li>If the processing is necessary for the purpose of the legitimate interest pursued by us or our partners</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where legitimate interest is identified as a lawful basis, we will undertake a legitimate interest assessment which is a three-part test covering:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>The purpose test</dt>\n<dd>to identify the legitimate interest</dd>\n<dt>Necessity test</dt>\n<dd>to consider if the processing is necessary for the purpose identified</dd>\n<dt>Balancing test</dt>\n<dd>considering the individual\u2019s interests, rights or freedoms and whether these override the legitimate interests identified.</dd>\n</dl> 4: What Information We Collect and Where From <i>\n</i>\n<p>We collect personal information from you, for example, if you register to our website, request product

<i>\n</i>\n<p>We take the responsibility for protecting your privacy very seriously and we will ensure your data is secured in accordance with our obligations under the Data Protection laws.\nWe have in place technical and organisational measures to ensure personal information is secured and to prevent your personal data from being accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.\nWe have in place a robust access control policy which limits access to your personal data to those employees, contractors and other third parties who only have a business need to know.\nThe processing of your personal data will only take place subject to our instruction.</p>\n<p>We have policies and procedures to handle any potential data security breaches and data subjects, third parties and any

been included in our summaries.\nAccordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights.</p>\n<p>Your principal rights under
