sure to take appropriate measures to protect this information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Retention of your Personal Data</strong>.\nIn addition to the retention periods mentioned in Section 1 above, in some

certification schemes like the EU - US Privacy Shield for the protection of Personal Data transferred from within the EU to the United States.\nIn addition, we bring to your attention that Israel is a country declared as offering adequate level of data protection (see here:
