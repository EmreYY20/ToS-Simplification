training for our staff or customer service representatives.\nAny information obtained from you through Customer support will be treated in accordance with the provisions of this

or combine it with your information to provide better service to you and inform you of Services or other information that may be of interest to you.\nOur Site offers you the functionality of using

functions on our behalf.\nWhen a third party acts solely on our behalf and otherwise as applicable, we use reasonable commercial efforts to require that party to follow the privacy practices stated in this Policy or have complementary privacy protections to protect your information.\nWe do not share your information with unaffiliated third parties except as permitted to do so in this Policy.</p>\n<strong>Disclosure Without Your Consent</strong>\n<p>In general, we may disclose your information without your consent to disclosure when we reasonably believe disclosure is appropriate in order to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Comply with the law (e.g., lawful subpoena or court order);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cooperate with or report to law enforcement agencies in investigations that involve

are the standard terms of service applicable to all Miro self-serve and reseller customers.\nIf you have subscribed to an Enterprise Plan, please visit our Master Cloud Agreement.</p>\n<p>This Miro Terms of Service (\u201c<strong>Agreement</strong>\u201d) is entered into by and between RealtimeBoard Inc.\ndba Miro (\u201c<strong>Miro</strong>\u201d) and the entity or person placing an order for or accessing the Service (\u201c<strong>Customer</strong>\u201d or \u201c<strong>you</strong>\u201d).\nThis Agreement consists of the terms and conditions set forth below and any Orders.\nIf you are accessing or using the Service on behalf of your company, you represent that you are authorized to accept this Agreement on behalf of your company, and all references to \u201cyou\u201d reference your company.</p>\n<p>\nThe \u201c<strong>Effective Date</strong>\u201d of this Agreement is the date which is the earlier of (a) Customer\u2019s initial access to the Service through any online provisioning, registration or order process or (b) the effective date of the first Order.\nThis Agreement will govern Customer\u2019s initial purchase on the Effective Date as well as any future purchases made by Customer that reference this Agreement.\nMiro may modify this Agreement from time to time as permitted in Section 19 (Modifications to Agreement).\n<strong>Purchase from Reseller</strong>: If Customer purchases the Service from an authorized reseller of Miro (\u201c<strong>Reseller</strong>\u201d), Customer\u2019s use of the Service will be governed by this Agreement, subject to Section 19.14 (Reseller Orders) below.\n<strong>By indicating your acceptance of this Agreement or accessing or using the Service, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\nEach party expressly agrees that this Agreement is legally binding upon it.</strong>\n</p> Overview<p>Miro offers a unique Service for visual collaboration that is designed to allow Users to create, collaborate and centralize communication through interactive online virtual whiteboards.\nCustomer maintains sole control over the types and content of all Customer Content it submits to the Service.</p>\nThe Service\nPermitted Use<p>During the Subscription Term, Customer may access and use the Service only for its internal business or personal purposes in accordance with the Documentation and this Agreement, including any usage limits in an Order.\nThis includes the right to copy and use the Software as part of Customer\u2019s authorized use of the Service.</p>\nUsers<p>Only Users may access or use the Service.\nEach User must keep its login credentials confidential and not share them with anyone else.\nCustomer is responsible for its Users\u2019 compliance with this Agreement and actions taken through their accounts (excluding misuse of accounts caused by Miro\u2019s breach of this Agreement).\nCustomer will promptly notify Miro if it becomes aware of any compromise of its User login credentials.\nMiro uses User account information as described in its Privacy Policy.</p>\nAdministrators<p>Customer may designate a User as an administrator with control over Customer\u2019s Service account, including management of Users and Customer Content, as described in the Documentation.\nCustomer is fully responsible for its choice of administrators and any actions they take.</p>\nCustomer Affiliates<p>Customer\u2019s Affiliates may use the Service as Users of Customer.\nAlternatively, an Affiliate of Customer may enter its own Order(s) as mutually agreed with Miro, and this creates a separate agreement between the Affiliate and Miro that incorporates this Agreement with the Affiliate treated as \u201cCustomer.\u201d Neither Customer nor any Customer Affiliate has any rights under each other\u2019s agreement with Miro, and breach or termination of any such agreement is not breach nor termination under any other.</p>\nRegistration Using Corporate Email <p>If you created an account using an email address belonging to your employer or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have authority to create an account on behalf of such entity and further acknowledge that Miro may share your email address with and control of your account may be taken over by such entity (as the \u201cCustomer\u201d).\nUpon such takeover, the administrator controlling the account may be able to (i) access, disclose, restrict or remove information from the account, (ii) restrict or terminate your access to the Service and (iii) prevent you from later disassociating such account from the Customer.</p>\nAccess to Third Party Boards<p>If you are invited to another Customer\u2019s Board, you acknowledge that your access to that Board as well as any content you submit will be under the sole control of that other Customer.\n</p>\nSharing Settings<p>Through the Service you control who you share Boards with (including making Boards public).\nMiro has no liability for how others may access or use Customer Content as a result of your or your Users\u2019 decision to share a Board.</p>\nAge Requirement for Users<p>The Service is not intended for, and may not be used by, anyone under the age of 16.\nCustomer is responsible for ensuring that all Users are at least 16 years old.</p>\nRestrictions<p>Customer will not (and will not permit anyone else to) do any of the following: (a) provide access to, distribute, sell or sublicense the Service to a third party, (b) use the Service on behalf of, or to provide any product or service to, third parties, (c) use the Service to develop a similar or competing product or service, (d) scrape, data mine, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or seek to access the source code or non-public APIs to or unauthorized data from the Service, except to the extent expressly permitted by Law (and then only with prior notice to Miro), (e) modify or create derivative works of the Service or copy any element of the Service (other than authorized copies of the Software), (f) remove or obscure any proprietary notices in the Service or otherwise misrepresent the source of ownership of the Service, (g) publish benchmarks or performance information about the Service, (h) interfere with the Service\u2019s operation, circumvent its access restrictions or conduct any security or vulnerability test of the Service, (i) transmit any viruses or other harmful materials to the Service, (j) allow Users to share User seats, (k) engage in any fraudulent, misleading, illegal or unethical activities related to the Service or (l) use the Service to store or transmit material which contains illegal content.</p>\nSupport<p>During the Subscription Term, Miro will provide Support in accordance with the Support Policy.\n</p>\nCustomer Content\nData Use<p>Customer grants Miro the non-exclusive, worldwide right to use, copy, store, transmit and display Customer Content and to modify and create derivative works of Customer Content (for reformatting or other technical purposes), but only as necessary to provide the Service, Support and any Technical Services to Customer under this Agreement.</p>\nSecurity<p>Miro uses reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect the Service and Customer Content as described in the Security Policy.\n</p>\nPersonal Data<p>Each party agrees to comply with the DPA.</p>\nData Export <p>During the Subscription Term or within 30 days thereafter, Customer may export its Customer Content from the Service using the export features described in the Documentation.\nAfter this export period, Miro may delete Customer Content in accordance with its standard schedule and procedures.\nIf Customer elects to proactively delete its account at any time, all associated Customer Content will be deleted permanently and cannot be retrieved.</p>\nCustomer Obligations\nGenerally<p>Customer is responsible for its Customer Content, including its content and accuracy, and agrees to comply with Laws in using the Service.\nCustomer represents and warrants that it has made all disclosures and has all rights, consents and permissions necessary to use its Customer Content with the Service and grant Miro the rights in Section 4.1 (Data Use), all without violating or infringing Laws, third-party rights (including intellectual property, publicity or privacy rights) or any terms or privacy policies that apply to the Customer Content.\n</p>\nProhibited Uses<p>Customer must not use the Service with Prohibited Data or for High Risk Activities.\nCustomer acknowledges that the Service is not intended to meet any legal obligations for these uses, including HIPAA requirements, and that Miro is not a Business Associate as defined under HIPAA.\nNotwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Miro has no liability for Prohibited Data or use of the Service for High Risk Activities.</p>\nIndividual User Account Takeover<p>The Service may contain functionality allowing Customer to convert accounts previously registered by individuals using email addresses from Customer\u2019s domain into User accounts under Customer\u2019s control.\nCustomer represents and warrants that it has all necessary rights and consents to the extent it converts any existing accounts registered using email addresses from Customer\u2019s domain into accounts under Customer\u2019s control.\n</p>\nSuspension of Service <p>Miro may suspend Customer\u2019s or a User\u2019s access to and use of the Service and related services if Customer breaches Section 2.8 (Age Requirement for Users), Section 2.9 (Restrictions) or Section 5 (Customer Obligations), if Customer\u2019s account is 10 days or more overdue or if Customer\u2019s or User\u2019s actions risk harm to other customers or the security, availability or integrity of the Service.\nWhere practicable, Miro will use reasonable efforts to provide Customer with prior notice of the suspension.\nOnce Customer resolves the issue requiring suspension, Miro will promptly restore Customer\u2019s or User\u2019s access to the Service in accordance with this Agreement.</p>\nThird-Party Platforms<p>Customer may choose to use the Service with Third-Party Platforms.\nUse of Third-Party Platforms is subject to Customer\u2019s agreement with the relevant provider and not this Agreement.\nMiro does not control and has no liability for Third-Party Platforms, including their security, functionality, operation, availability or interoperability or how the Third-Party Platforms or their providers use Customer Content.\nIf Customer enables a Third-Party Platform with the Service, Miro may access and exchange Customer Content with the Third-Party Platform on Customer\u2019s behalf.</p>\nTechnical Services<p>Any purchased Technical Services are as described in the relevant Order.\nCustomer will give Miro timely access to Customer Materials reasonably needed for the Technical Services, and if Customer fails to do so, Miro\u2019s obligation to provide Technical Services will be excused until access is provided.\nMiro will use Customer Materials only for purposes of providing Technical Services.\nAny Technical Services deliverables relate to the configuration or use of the Service.\nCustomer may use Technical Services deliverables only as part of its authorized use of the Service, subject to the same terms as for the Service in Section 2 (The Service) and Section 5 (Customer Obligations).</p>\nCommercial TermsSubscription Term<p>Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Order, each Subscription Term will renew for successive 12-month periods, unless either party gives the other party notice of non-renewal at least 90 days before the current Subscription Term ends.\nUpon notice of non-renewal, Customer will not be charged for the next billing cycle but will not receive any refunds or credits for amounts that have already been charged.</p>\nFees and Taxes<p>Fees are as described in each Order.\nCustomer will reimburse Miro for pre-approved travel and lodging expenses it incurs in providing Technical Services.\nFees are invoiced on the schedule in the Order and reimbursable expenses are invoiced in arrears.\nCustomer agrees that Miro may bill Customer\u2019s credit card or other payment method for renewals, expenses and any other unpaid fees, as applicable.\nCustomer may change its payment method information by entering updated information through the user interface of the Service.\nUnless the Order provides otherwise, all fees and expenses are due within 30 days of the billing date specified in the applicable Order.\nFees for renewal Subscription Terms are at Miro\u2019s then-current rates, regardless of any discounted pricing in a prior Order.\nLate payments are subject to a service charge of 1.5% per month or the maximum amount allowed by Law, whichever is less.\nAll fees and expenses are non-refundable except as set out in Section 10.2 (Warranty Remedy) and Section 14.4 (Mitigation and Exceptions).\nCustomer is responsible for any sales, use, goods and services, value-added, withholding or similar taxes or levies that apply to its Orders, whether domestic or foreign (\u201c<strong>Taxes</strong>\u201d), other than Miro\u2019s income tax.\nFees and expenses are exclusive of Taxes.</p>\nWarranties and Disclaimers\nLimited Warranty<p>Miro warrants to Customer that:</p>\n<p>(a)\tthe Service will perform materially as described in the Documentation and Miro will not materially decrease the overall functionality of the Service during a Subscription Term (the \u201c<strong>Performance Warranty</strong>\u201d) and\n(b)\tMiro will perform any Technical Services in a professional and workmanlike manner (the \u201c<strong>Technical Services Warranty</strong>\u201d).</p>\nWarranty Remedy<p>If Miro breaches Section 10.1 (Limited Warranty) and Customer makes a reasonably detailed warranty claim within 30 days of discovering the issue, then Miro will use reasonable efforts to correct the non-conformity.\nIf Miro cannot do so within 60 days of Customer\u2019s warranty claim, either party may terminate the affected Order as relates to the non-conforming Service or Technical Services.\nMiro will then refund to Customer any pre-paid, unused fees for the terminated portion of the Subscription Term (for the Performance Warranty) or for the non-conforming Technical Services (for the Technical Services Warranty).\nThese procedures are Customer\u2019s exclusive remedy and Miro\u2019s entire liability for breach of the warranties in Section 10.1.\nThese warranties do not apply to (a) issues caused by misuse or unauthorized modifications, (b) issues in or caused by Third-Party Platforms or other third-party systems or (c) Trials and Betas or other free or evaluation use.</p>\nDisclaimers<p>\n<strong>Except as expressly provided in Section 10.1 (Limited Warranty), the Service, Support, Technical Services and all related Miro services are provided \u201cAS IS\u201d.\nMiro and its suppliers make no other warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title or noninfringement.\nWithout limiting its express obligations in Section 3 (Support), Miro does not warrant that Customer\u2019s use of the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free or that the Service will meet Customer\u2019s requirements, operate in combination with third-party services used by Customer or maintain Customer Content without loss.\nMiro is not liable for delays, failures or problems inherent in use of the Internet and electronic communications or other systems outside Miro\u2019s control.\nCustomer may have other statutory rights, but any statutorily required warranties will be limited to the shortest legally permitted period.</strong>\n</p>\nTerm and Termination\nTerm<p>This Agreement starts on the Effective Date and continues until 90 days after expiration or termination of all Subscription Terms.</p>\nTermination for Cause<p>Either party may terminate this Agreement (including all Orders) if the other party (a) fails to cure a material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within 30 days after notice, (b) ceases operation without a successor or (c) seeks protection under a bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors\u2019 arrangement, composition or comparable proceeding, or if such a proceeding is instituted against that party and not dismissed within 60 days.\n</p>\nTermination for Convenience<p>Either party may terminate this Agreement (including all Orders) at any time for any reason upon 90 days\u2019 notice to the other party, provided (i) Customer will not be entitled to a refund of any pre-paid fees and (ii) if Customer has not already paid all applicable fees for the then-current Subscription Term, any such fees that are outstanding will become immediately due and payable.</p>\nEffect of Termination<p>Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement or an Order, Customer\u2019s access to the Service and Technical Services will cease, other than limited use of the Service to export Customer Content as described in Section 4.4 (Data Export).\nAt the disclosing party\u2019s request upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, the receiving party will delete all of the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information (excluding Customer Content, which is addressed in Section 4.4).\nCustomer Content and other Confidential Information may be retained in the receiving party\u2019s standard backups after deletion but will remain subject to this Agreement\u2019s confidentiality restrictions.</p>\nSurvival<p>These Sections survive expiration or termination of this Agreement: 2.9 (Restrictions), 4.4 (Data Export), 5 (Customer Obligations), 9.2 (Fees and Taxes), 10.3 (Disclaimers), 11.4 (Effect of Termination), 11.5 (Survival), 12 (Ownership), 13 (Limitations of Liability), 14 (Indemnification), 15 (Confidentiality), 16 (Required Disclosures), 20 (General Terms) and 21 (Definitions).\nExcept where an exclusive remedy is provided, exercising a remedy under this Agreement, including termination, does not limit other remedies a party may have.</p>\nOwnership<p>Neither party grants the other any rights or licenses not expressly set out in this Agreement.\nExcept for Miro\u2019s use rights in this Agreement, between the parties Customer retains all intellectual property and other rights in Customer Content and Customer Materials provided to Miro.\nExcept for Customer\u2019s use rights in this Agreement, Miro and its licensors retain all intellectual property and other rights in the Service, any Technical Services deliverables and related Miro technology, templates, formats and dashboards, including any modifications or improvements to these items made by Miro.\nMiro may generate and use Usage Data to operate, improve, analyze and support the Service and for other lawful business purposes.\nIf Customer provides Miro with feedback or suggestions regarding the Service or other Miro offerings, Miro may use the feedback or suggestions without restriction or obligation.</p>\nLimitations of Liability\nConsequential Damages Waiver <p>\n<strong>The disclaimer in this Section 13.1 (Consequential Damages Waiver) will not apply to the extent prohibited by Laws.\nExcept for Excluded Claims, neither party (nor its suppliers) will have any liability arising out of or related to this Agreement for any loss of use, lost data, lost profits, failure of security mechanisms, revenues, goodwill, interruption of business or any indirect, special, incidental, reliance or consequential damages of any kind, even if informed of their possibility in advance.</strong>\n</p>\nLiability Cap<p>\n<strong>Except for Excluded Claims, each party\u2019s (and its suppliers\u2019) entire liability arising out of or related to this Agreement will not exceed in aggregate the amounts paid or payable by Customer to Miro during the prior 12 months under this Agreement.</strong>\n</p>\nExcluded Claims<p>\u201c<strong>Excluded Claims</strong>\u201d means: (a) Customer\u2019s breach of Sections 2.9 (Restrictions) or 5 (Customer Obligations), (b) either party\u2019s breach of Section 15 (Confidentiality) (but excluding claims relating to Customer Content), (c) amounts payable to third parties under Customer\u2019s obligations in Section 14.2 (Indemnification by Customer), (d) either party\u2019s willful misconduct or (e) Miro\u2019s performance of the Service that results in death, personal injury or damage to tangible property.</p>Nature of Claims and Failure of Essential Purpose<p>The waivers and limitations in this Section 13 apply regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise and will survive and apply even if any limited remedy in this Agreement fails of its essential purpose.</p>\nIndemnification\nIndemnification by Miro<p>Miro will defend Customer from and against any third-party claim to the extent alleging that the Service, when used by Customer as authorized in this Agreement, infringes a third party\u2019s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret, and will indemnify and hold harmless Customer against any damages or costs awarded against Customer (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) or agreed in settlement by Miro resulting from the claim.\n</p>\nIndemnification by Customer<p>Customer will defend Miro from and against any third-party claim to the extent resulting from Customer Content, Customer Materials or Customer\u2019s breach or alleged breach of Section 5 (Customer Obligations), and will indemnify and hold harmless Miro against any damages or costs awarded against Miro (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) or agreed in settlement by Customer resulting from the claim.</p>\nProcedures<p>The indemnifying party\u2019s obligations in this Section 14 are subject to receiving (a) prompt notice of the claim, (b) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense and settlement of the claim and (c) all reasonably necessary cooperation of the indemnified party, at the indemnifying party\u2019s expense for reasonable out-of-pocket costs.\nThe indemnifying party may not settle any claim without the indemnified party\u2019s prior consent if settlement would require the indemnified party to admit fault or take or refrain from taking any action (other than relating to use of the Service, when Miro is the indemnifying party).\nThe indemnified party may participate in a claim with its own counsel at its own expense.</p>\nMitigation and Exceptions<p>In response to an actual or potential infringement claim, if required by settlement or injunction or as Miro determines necessary to avoid material liability, Miro may at its option: (a) procure rights for Customer\u2019s continued use of the Service, (b) replace or modify the allegedly infringing portion of the Service to avoid infringement without reducing the Service\u2019s overall functionality or (c) terminate the affected Order and refund to Customer any pre-paid, unused fees for the terminated portion of the Subscription Term.\nMiro\u2019s obligations in this Section 14 do not apply (1) to the extent infringement results from Customer\u2019s modification of the Service or use of the Service in combination with items not specified in the Documentation or provided by Miro (including Third-Party Platforms), (2) to infringement resulting from Software other than the most recent release provided by Miro, (3) to unauthorized use of the Service, (4) if Customer settles or makes any admissions about a claim without Miro\u2019s prior consent, (5) if Customer continues to use the Service (or any element thereof) after being notified of allegedly infringing activity or informed of modifications that would have avoided the alleged infringement or (6) to Trials and Betas or other free or evaluation use.\n<strong>This Section 14 sets out Customer\u2019s exclusive remedy and Miro\u2019s entire liability regarding infringement of third-party intellectual property rights.</strong>\n</p>\nConfidentiality\nDefinition<p>\u201c<strong>Confidential Information</strong>\u201d means information disclosed to the receiving party under this Agreement that is designated by the disclosing party as proprietary or confidential or that should be reasonably understood to be proprietary or confidential due to its nature and the circumstances of its disclosure.\nMiro\u2019s Confidential Information includes the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any technical or performance information about the Service.\nCustomer\u2019s Confidential Information includes Customer Content.</p>\nObligations<p>As receiving party, each party will (a) hold Confidential Information in confidence and not disclose it to third parties except as permitted in this Agreement, including Section 4.1 (Data Use), and (b) only use Confidential Information to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights in this Agreement.\nThe receiving party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know (including, for Miro, the subcontractors referenced in Section 20.9), provided it remains responsible for their compliance with this Section 15 and they are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section 15.</p>\nExclusions<p>These confidentiality obligations do not apply to information that the receiving party can document (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party, (b) it rightfully knew or possessed prior to receipt under this Agreement, (c) it rightfully received from a third party without breach of confidentiality obligations or (d) it independently developed without using the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information.\n</p>\nRemedies<p>Unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone are an insufficient remedy.\nEach party may seek appropriate equitable relief, in addition to other available remedies, for breach or threatened breach of this Section 15.</p>\nRequired Disclosures<p>Nothing in this Agreement prohibits either party from making disclosures, including of Customer Content and other Confidential Information, if required by Law, subpoena or court order, provided (if permitted by Law) it notifies the other party in advance and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential treatment.</p>\nTrials and Betas <p>If Customer receives access to the Service or Service features on a free or trial basis or as an alpha, beta or early access offering (\u201c<strong>Trials and Betas</strong>\u201d), use is permitted only for Customer\u2019s internal evaluation during the period designated by Miro (or if not designated, 30 days).\nTrials and Betas are optional and either party may terminate Trials and Betas at any time for any reason.\nTrials and Betas may be inoperable, incomplete or include features that Miro may never release, and their features and performance information are Miro\u2019s Confidential Information.\n<strong>Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Miro provides Trials and Betas \u201cAS IS\u201d with no warranty, indemnity or support and its liability for Trials and Betas will not exceed US$50.</strong>\n</p>\nPublicity<p>Neither party may publicly announce this Agreement except with the other party\u2019s prior consent or as required by Laws.\nHowever, Miro may include Customer and its trademarks in Miro\u2019s customer lists and promotional materials but will cease this use at Customer\u2019s written request.</p>Modifications to Agreement<p>Miro may modify this Agreement (which may include changes to Service pricing and plans) from time to time by giving notice to Customer by email or through the Service.\nUnless a shorter period is specified by Miro (e.g., due to changes in the Law or exigent circumstances), modifications become effective upon renewal of Customer\u2019s current Subscription Term or entry into a new Order.\nIf Miro specifies that the modifications to the Agreement will take effect prior to Customer\u2019s next renewal or Order and Customer notifies Miro of its objection to the modifications within 30 days after the date of such notice, Miro (at its option and as Customer\u2019s exclusive remedy) will either: (a) permit Customer to continue under the existing version of this Agreement until expiration of the then-current Subscription Term (after which time the modified Agreement will go into effect) or (b) allow Customer to terminate this Agreement and receive a refund of any pre-paid Service fees allocable to the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term.\nCustomer may be required to click to accept or otherwise agree to the modified Agreement in order to continue using the Service, and, in any event, continued use of the Service after the updated version of this Agreement goes into effect will constitute Customer\u2019s acceptance of such updated version.</p>\nGeneral Terms\nAssignment<p>Neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior consent of the other party, except that either party may assign this Agreement in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all its assets or voting securities.\nAny non-permitted assignment is void.\nThis Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party\u2019s permitted successors and assigns.</p>\nGoverning Law, Jurisdiction and Venue<p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California and the United States without regard to conflicts of laws provisions and without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.\nThe jurisdiction and venue for actions related to this Agreement will be the state and United States federal courts located in San Francisco, California and both parties submit to the personal jurisdiction of those courts.</p>\nAttorneys\u2019 Fees and Costs<p>The prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in connection with such action.</p>\nNotices<p>Except as set out in this Agreement, any notice or consent under this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed given: (a) upon receipt if by personal delivery, (b) upon receipt if by certified or registered U.S.\nmail (return receipt requested) or (c) one day after dispatch if by a commercial overnight delivery service.\nIf to Miro, notice must be provided to RealtimeBoard Inc.\ndba Miro, 201 Spear Street, Suite 1100, San Francisco, CA 94105, Attention: Legal Department.\nAll notices to Miro must include a copy emailed to legal@miro.com.\nIf to Customer, Miro may provide notice to the address Customer provided at registration.\nEither party may update its address with notice to the other party.\nMiro may also send operational notices to Customer by email or through the Service.</p>\nEntire Agreement<p>This Agreement (which includes all Orders, the Policies and the DPA) is the parties\u2019 entire agreement regarding its subject matter and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements regarding its subject matter.\nIn this Agreement, headings are for convenience only and \u201cincluding\u201d and similar terms are to be construed without limitation.\nThis Agreement may be executed in counterparts (including electronic copies and PDFs), each of which is deemed an original and which together form one and the same agreement.</p>\nAmendments<p>Except as otherwise provided herein, any amendments, modifications or supplements to this Agreement must be in writing and signed by each party\u2019s authorized representatives or, as appropriate, agreed through electronic means provided by Miro.\nNonetheless, with notice to Customer, Miro may modify the Policies to reflect new features or changing practices, but the modifications will not materially decrease
