cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications.\nHowever, on many mobile devices, application users may limit ad tracking of certain mobile ads via their device settings.\nYou may also control interest-based advertising on apps on your mobile device in certain jurisdictions with the AppChoices app.\nThe online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt out of

choice and privacy at www.aboutads.info/choices/, youradchoices.ca/choices/ and www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.</p>\n<p>To be clear, these cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out.\nYou must separately opt out in each browser on each device.\nAdvertisements on third party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Policy may have been directed to you based on information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites.\nThese advertisements provide a mechanism to opt out of the

Waiver.<p>Please read the following (this \"Provision\") carefully.\nIt affects your rights.</p>\n<p>Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to a customer's satisfaction by contacting us at info@smartrent.com.\nThis Provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and the Company.\nArbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute waive their rights to file a lawsuit, to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead submit their disputes to a neutral third person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision.\nYou have the right to opt-out of this Provision (as explained below), which means you would retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court, either before a judge or jury.</p>\n<p>Please read this Provision carefully.\nIt provides that all Disputes between you and the Company shall be resolved by binding arbitration.\nArbitration replaces the right to go to court.\nIn the absence of this arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions).\nExcept as otherwise provided, entering into this agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury.\nThere is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney's fees).</p>\n<p>For the purpose of this Provision, \"the Company\" means the Company and its parents, subsidiary, and affiliate companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents.\nThe term \"Dispute\" means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and the Company regarding any aspect of your relationship with the Company, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below).\n\"Dispute\" is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as the Company's licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.</p>\n<p>WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</strong>\n</p>\n<p>For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give the Company an opportunity to resolve the Dispute.\nYou must commence this process by mailing written notification to the Company at 18835 N.\nThompson Peak Pkwy, Suite 300, Scottsdale, AZ 85255.\nThat written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your Claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek.\nIf the Company does not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration.\nYou may pursue your Dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the above, you or the Company may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if (a) the Dispute qualifies,it may be initiated in small claims court.\nor (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the \"Opt-Out Deadline\").\nYou may opt out of this Provision by mailing written notification to the Company, at 18835 N.\nThompson Peak Pkwy, Suite 300, Scottsdale, AZ 85255.\nYour written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with the Company through arbitration.\nYour decision to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with the Company.\n<strong>Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your Dispute in arbitration or small claims court.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Procedures</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If this Provision applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either you or the Company may initiate arbitration proceedings.\nThe American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator.\nThe arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a class arbitration.\nAll issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Provision.</p>\n<p>For arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply.\nfor Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply.\nIn either instance, the AAA's Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply.\nThe AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nFor arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp.\nProcedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply.\nThe JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267.\nThis Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules.\nUnder no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.</p>\n<p>Because the Site and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\") governs the arbitrability of all Disputes.\nHowever, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.</p>\n<p>Arbitration Award \u2013 The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding.\nThe arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.\nSuch award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.</p>\n<p>Location of Arbitration \u2013 You or the Company may initiate arbitration in either Maricopa County, Arizona or the federal judicial district that includes your billing address.\nIn the event that you select the federal judicial district that includes your billing address, the Company may transfer the arbitration to Maricopa County, Arizona in the event that it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the transfer, as determined by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs \u2013 the Company will pay all arbitration filing fees and arbitrator's costs and expenses upon your written request given prior to the commencement of the arbitration.\nYou are responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses.\nFees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law.\nIn addition to any rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with the Company as provided in the section above titled \"Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution\" and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Class Action Waiver</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and the
