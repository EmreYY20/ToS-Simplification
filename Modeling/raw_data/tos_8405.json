due care.\nthey are subject to our direction, and are regularly monitored.\nYou will find detailed information below on the operations necessary in cases where we commission service providers to provide certain functions for our Online Services, or where we wish to use your data for advertising purposes.\nIn this connection, we will also inform you about the criteria we will apply to the period for which the personal data will be stored.</p>\n<p>We may furthermore disclose your personal data to third parties in cases where we join forces with partners to give our users a chance to use certain services, such as participating in special activities, going in for competitions to win prizes, or concluding a contract.\nMore detailed information on this issue is provided below in the context of a description of each particular service.</p>\n<p>The data will be erased as soon as they are no longer needed for the purpose for which they were collected.</p>Purpose of processing<p>Storing and processing of such data is necessary for the proper functioning of the Online Services, e.g.\nin order to provide the Online Services to users, or to enable users to contact us.\nWe use the data to improve the functioning of our Online Services and in order to ensure that our information technology systems are secure.</p>Contacting us<p>If you contact us via email or using the contact form, your data (name as well as contact details, if provided) and your message will be processed solely for the purpose of processing and handling your enquiry.\nIn compliance with Article 6(1)(b) GDPR or Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, as the case may be, we will process this type of data for the purpose of handling your enquiry.\nAs soon as your enquiry has been fully processed, your data will be erased.\nYour data will be erased if circumstances show that the matter in question has been conclusively settled, and no statutory data retention obligations stand in the way of us erasing the data.</p>Data processing if you visit our website<p>We will only log the personal data that your browser transmits to our server if you use our website solely to obtain information, i.e.\nif you do not register or transmit information to us in any other manner.\nIf you view our website, we will collect the type of data described below.\nWe require these data for technical reasons, in order to be able to display our website to you and also to guarantee its stability and security.\nThe legal basis for data processing is provided by Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.</p>\n<p>The following data will be collected in this context: your IP address (anonymised), the date and time of the request, the time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), the subject matter of the

below.\ntheir scope and method of operation are also explained below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Temporary cookies will be erased automatically as soon as you close your browser.\nThis type of cookie particularly includes so-called session cookies.\nSession cookies store a so-called \u201csession ID\u201d that enables a cookie to assign the various requests from your browser to the joint session shared by all these requests.\nThis will enable our server to recognise your computer when you return to our website.\nSession cookies will be erased as soon as you log out or close your browser.</li>\n<li>Permanent cookies are erased automatically after a predetermined period has elapsed.\nthis period may vary, depending on the type of cookie.\nYou can erase cookies in the security settings of your browser at any time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also configure your browser settings to reflect your wishes.\nyou can refuse, for instance, to accept third party cookies, or any cookies

registration you can choose whether you want to be identified by a user name of your choice, or by your real name.\nOnly your user name will always be visible to all other registered persons.</p>\n<p>If required, you may at any time modify or erase the data you provided during registration.\nplease use the following link for this purpose: https://lernu.net/uzanto/agordoj.</p>\n<p>Finally, we also collect and store data on the progress a registered user has made in learning a language.\nthis may include information about the lessons he or she has already completed, the words learnt, or the tests he or she has done.\nThe purpose of this type of data collection is to support and help registered persons while they are learning, and also to continually improve and optimise, for the benefit of all users, the services provided on our website.\nSome of these data may be visible to other registered persons, e.g.\nin the form of \u201cpoints scored\u201d.\nThis type of personal data is directly linked to a specific customer account.\nthe data are anonymised as soon as the purpose of data processing ceases to exist.</p>\n<p>In

advertising service Google AdSense, which is used to present you with advertising geared to your interests.\nIn so doing, we aim to show you advertising that might be of interest to you, thereby making our website more interesting to you.\nIn order to do so, we collect statistical information about you, which is then further processed by our advertising partners.\nSuch advertisements can be identified by the \u201cGoogle ad\u201d caption displayed in an advertisement.</p>\n<p>If you visit our website, Google will be notified that you have accessed our website.\nGoogle uses a web beacon
