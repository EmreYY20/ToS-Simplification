versions)</small>\n</p>\n<p>This privacy policy by Mojeek Limited, explains our stance on personal information, in regard to cookies, tracking, logging, data usage, contact information and any links to third parties.\n</p>\n<p>Mojeek follows a strict no tracking privacy policy, and it's quite simple, we don't track our users.\nIn fact, Mojeek was the first ever no tracking/privacy orientated search engine, as can be seen on archive.org and our original privacy policy from when Mojeek was just a side project.</p> Cookie Policy <p>By default and unless specifically agreed to, Mojeek doesn't place any cookies on your computer.\nIf Mojeek does require to place a cookie, your agreement will be requested, for example when setting personal preferences.\nAlso at any time, visiting this page will list what cookies Mojeek has on your computer, their contents, and an explanation of their values.\nFrom that page you can also instruct Mojeek to delete any cookie we have placed.</p> Tracking and Logging Policy <p>Mojeek doesn't implement any kind of specific user tracking, whether that be at the time of visit or subsequently via standard logs, which Mojeek does keep.\nThese logs contain the time of visit, page requested, possibly referral data, and located in a separate log browser information.\nIP addresses are not recorded, instead the IP address is replaced with a simple two letter code indicating the visitors country of origin.\nBy doing this, Mojeek removes any possibility of tracking or identifying any particular user.\nWe use a URL parameter to monitor if a campaign landing page visit results in a Mojeek search request.\nThis parameter is visible in the URL and is not used after the first search.</p> Data Usage <p>The remaining log data (country, time/date, page requested, referral data, and in a separate log browser data), which although now contains no identifiable data, would still in no situation whatsoever be sold or distributed to any third party vendors.\nThis data is kept private for the sole purpose of storing historical traffic volumes and country demographics of our visitors.\nWe may also use aggregate, non-personal search data to improve our results.</p> Contact Information <p>We only use your name and email address for the purpose of responding to contact requests that you have made through our Contact page, or for communications regarding registration with the Mojeek community.\nWe do not use these details for any other purpose.\nFurthermore, under GDPR, we respect that if you request and no longer give consent to us possessing your name and email address for contact reason, we will delete this data.</p> Other Websites <p>The Mojeek website contains links to other websites.\nThis privacy policy only applies to this website.\nWhen you proceed to other websites via our links, our privacy policy is void.</p> Third Parties <p>We do not outsource any development of Mojeek to third parties.\nall development is kept in-house.\nWe pride ourselves on limiting the number of third party products and services that Mojeek consumes.</p>\n<p>If you have any further questions please contact us, we'll be happy to answer any questions or concerns you may have.</p>\n<p>\n<small>View this policy with changes

Introduction <p>This policy document covers how we approach the processing of requests for and provision of search content.\nWe explain our commitment to human rights, notably the freedom to seek.\nWe explain how we would handle government requests, our approach to transparency reporting and how you can contact us regarding content removal.\nThis content policy is complementary to our detailed Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</p> Freedom and Limitations <p>Mojeek believes one of the greatest challenges confronting the global community is how to protect and preserve the rights and freedoms of everyone.\nThis includes the internationally recognised freedoms to seek and receive information and ideas.\nProviding useful tools which protect these freedoms, and enable people to exercise them, is core to our mission.\nAs an international web search engine we have a responsibility to support and preserve rights and freedoms, for users across the world, subject only to limitations as determined by law.\nOur starting point is freedom of expression and specifically the freedom to seek information.\nConsequently we do not restrict access to search results, nor remove indexed search data, except in very specific circumstances, as follows:</p> Terrorist content <p>Our Services may not make available some information that associated with known terrorist and violent extremist (TVE) organisations, based on guidance from Tech Against Terrorism.</p> Child sexual abuse material <p>Our Services will not make available some information for specific legal reasons, in accordance with applicable law, such as child sexual abuse material (CSAM).\nWe are Associate Members of Internet Watch Foundation who guide us in matters relating to CSAM.</p> Spam and Malware <p>For content that is designed to game search engines, we will take action.</p>\n<p>For phishing sites and pages that host malware and viruses, aiming to cause some harm to their visitors, we will take action including not indexing.</p> Information Neutrality <p>We apply only takedown in the specific circumstances above.\nWe do not use human moderation in our search ranking.\nRankings are determined by fully automated algorithms, based on signals which are automatically calculated uniformly for all URLs.\nOur algorithms are largely deterministic, so are less prone to the biases that are inherent in AI more widely used by other web search engines.\nBy AI, we refer primarily to machine learning methods and the, inevitably biased, training datasets on which they are based.\nAt Mojeek we practice information neutrality</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cInformation Neutrality is the principle to treat all information provided (by a service) equally.\nThe information provided, after being processed by an information-neutral service, is the same for every user requesting it, independent of the user's attributes, including, e.g., origin, history or personal preferences and independent of the financial or influential interest of the service provider, as well as independent of the timeliness of information.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>We consider \"personalisation\" to be a process of manipulation, wrapped-up in the coat of convenience.</p>\n<p>Human intervention and re-ranking (\"curation\") of search results would be an introduction of bias by Mojeek, so we do not do so this.\nTo do so may be theoretical right as an independent business but it would be counter to our mission and in opposition to our values.</p> Human Rights <p>We are guided by the United Nations and specifically the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).\nWe note in particular ICCPR Article 19:</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cEveryone shall have the right to freedom of expression.\nthis right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.\"</em>\n</p>\n<p>These rights are subject to limitations.\nnotably expressed in UDHR Articles 29(2):</p>\n<p>\n<em>\"In the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society.\"</em> and in UDHR Article 30:</p>\n<p>\n<em>\"Nothing in this Declaration may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein.\"</em>\n</p>\n<p>As a search engine we care deeply about ensuring that everyone has the right of freedom to seek.\nFor more information on how important we regard this right to be, and our human right based approach, please see our article \"Freedom to Seek Matters\".</p> Government Requests <p>Mojeek has not received any requests from any government authorities to remove content on Mojeek.\nMojeek has not received any requests from any government authorities to provide data.\nSince we do not collect personal data for our web search, a request for such data cannot be provided.\nIn the circumstances where we do receive requests we shall deal with them according to the following law and policies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Requests from UK government authorities</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Laws of England</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Requests from government authorities other than UK</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Laws of England</li>\n<li>Law of requesting country</li>\n<li>International norms which means we only provide data in response to requests that satisfy the Global Network Initiative's Principles on Freedom of Expression and Privacy and its associated implementation guidelines</li>\n<li>Mojeek's policies which include any applicable terms, including Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and our Content Policy (this document).</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>We highlight for Governments that may be considering requesting data from us that Mojeek indexes only HTML webpages.\nWe do not index images or video.\nThe content we show is URLs, the associated URL titles and snippets derived from URL content.</p>\n<p>A government request to remove content from Mojeek should include at least the information below.\nWhere there is failure to provide complete information we shall not respond to the request:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The URL(s) for which removal is requested</li>\n<li>The reason for the requested removal</li>\n<li>The applicable law under which the request is made</li>\n<li>Details of the requesting institution</li>\n<li>Evidence that the requested content is available on Mojeek</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we are required or chose to remove content, we shall do by removing the applicable URL(s) from our index, meaning that no user or customer will be served that URL in search results.</p> Transparency Reporting <p>Soon after the end of each calendar year, we commit to publishing a transparency report.\nThis will include actions taken in respect of dealing with CSAM and TVE search queries and content.</p> Content Removal <p>Please contact us, to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>request content removal for a legal reason</li>\n<li>report content which in your opinion should be removed for legal reasons</li>\n<li>appeal against what you believe is content that has been erroneously removed for legal reasons</li>\n</ul> Missing Content <p>Please note that just because a webpage doesn't appear in Mojeek results, that rarely means that we have removed it.\nIt is far more likely that we have not indexed it for technical reasons of which there are too many to detail.\nBut here are a few: the webpage is very new.\nthe site requests that we do not index it either via their robots.txt, meta tags or by blocking us.\nthe page text content is predominantly Javascript.</p>\n<p>If you think a webpage has not been indexed when it should have been please contact us.</p> ", "created_at": "2023-06-06 12:46:28.239709", "updated_at": "2023-06-06 12:47:21.542081"}], "points": [{"id": 13998, "title": "There is a date of the last
