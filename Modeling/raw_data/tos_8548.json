PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>\n8.\nDispute Resolution\n<p>YOU AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISIONS:</p>\n<p>(a) MANDATORY ARBITRATION.\nYou and RizzGPT agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or our Services through final and binding arbitration, except that you have the right to opt out of these arbitration terms, and future changes to these arbitration terms, by filling out this form within 30 days of agreeing to these arbitration terms or the relevant changes.</p>\n<p>(b) Informal Dispute Resolution.\nWe would like to understand and try to address your concerns prior to formal legal action.\nBefore filing a claim against RizzGPT, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by sending us notice at support@RizzGPT.com of your name, a description of the dispute, and the relief you seek.\nIf we are unable to resolve a dispute within 60 days, you may bring a formal proceeding.\nAny statute of limitations will be tolled during the 60-day resolution process.</p>\n<p>(c) Arbitration Forum.\nEither party may commence binding arbitration through ADR Services, an alternative dispute resolution provider.\nThe parties will pay equal shares of the arbitration fees.\nIf the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay the arbitration fees and cannot obtain a waiver, RizzGPT will pay them for you.\nRizzGPT will not seek its attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</p>\n<p>(d) Arbitration Procedures.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, video conference, or in person in New York, NY or at another mutually agreed location.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by a sole arbitrator by ADR Services under its then-prevailing rules.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including but not limited to issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Section.\nThe amount of any settlement offer will not be disclosed to the arbitrator by either party until after the arbitrator determines the final award, if any.</p>\n<p>(e).\nExceptions.\nThis arbitration clause does not require arbitration of the following claims: (i) individual claims brought in small claims court.\nand (ii) injunctive or other equitable relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services or intellectual property infringement.</p>\n<p>(f) NO CLASS ACTIONS.\nDisputes must be brought on an individual basis only, and may not be brought as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding.\nClass arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.\nIf for any reason a dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, each party knowingly and irrevocably waives any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim.\nThis does not prevent either party from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.</p>\n<p>(g) Severability.\nIf any part of this Section 8 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect, except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class or representative arbitration, this Section 8 will be unenforceable in its entirety.\nNothing in this Section will be deemed to waive or otherwise limit the right to seek public injunctive relief or any other non-waivable right, pending a ruling on the substance of such claim from the arbitrator.</p>\n9.\nGeneral Terms\n<p>(a) Relationship of the Parties.\nThese Terms do not create a partnership, joint venture or agency relationship between you and RizzGPT or any of RizzGPT\u2019s affiliates.\nRizzGPT and you are independent contractors and neither party will have the power to bind the other or to incur obligations on the other\u2019s behalf without the other party\u2019s prior written consent.</p>\n<p>(b) Use of Brands.\nYou may not use RizzGPT\u2019s or any of its affiliates\u2019 names, logos, or trademarks, without our prior written consent.</p>\n<p>(c) U.S.\nFederal Agency Entities.\nThe Services were developed solely at private expense and are commercial computer software and related documentation within the meaning of the applicable U.S.\nFederal Acquisition Regulation and agency supplements thereto.</p>\n<p>(d) Assignment and Delegation.\nYou may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under these Terms, including in connection with a change of control.\nAny purported assignment and delegation shall be null and void.\nWe may assign these Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or to any affiliate or as part of a corporate reorganization.</p>\n<p>(e) Modifications.\nWe may amend these Terms from time to time by posting a revised version on the website, or if an update materially adversely affects your rights or obligations under these Terms we will provide notice to you either by emailing the email associated with your account or providing an in-product notification.\nChanges will become effective no sooner than 30 days after we notify you.\nAll other changes will be effective immediately.\nYour continued use of the Services after any change means you agree to such change.</p>\n<p>(f) Notices.\nAll notices will be in writing.\nWe may notify you using the registration information you provided or the email address associated with your use of the Services.\nService will be deemed given on the date of receipt if delivered by email or on the date sent via courier if delivered by post.\nRizzGPT accepts service of process at this address: RizzGPT, Superdrop Labs

does not mean RizzGPT is giving up any of our rights.\nExcept as provided in Section 8, if any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that term will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and it will not affect the enforceability of any other terms.</p>\n<p>(h) Export Controls.\nThe Services may not be used in or for the benefit of, exported, or re-exported (a) into any U.S.\nembargoed countries (collectively, the \u201cEmbargoed Countries\u201d) or (b) to anyone on the U.S.\nTreasury Department\u2019s list of Specially Designated Nationals, any other restricted party lists (existing now or in the future) identified by the Office of Foreign Asset Control, or the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce Denied Persons

acknowledge that if you violate or breach these Terms, it may cause irreparable harm to RizzGPT and its affiliates, and RizzGPT shall have the right to seek injunctive relief against you in addition to any other legal remedies.</p>\n<p>(j) Entire Agreement.\nThese Terms and any policies incorporated in these Terms contain the entire agreement between you and RizzGPT regarding the use of the Services and, other than any Service specific terms of use or any applicable enterprise agreements, supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications, or understandings between you and RizzGPT on that subject.</p>\n<p>(k) Jurisdiction, Venue and Choice of Law.\nThese Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of New York, excluding New York\u2019s conflicts of law rules or
