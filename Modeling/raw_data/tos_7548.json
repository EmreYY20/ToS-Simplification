do with your information.<p>\n</p>\n<p>We collect personal information from you as you use BoardGameGeek, BoardGameGeek Store, VideoGameGeek, RPGGeek, or any of our other websites (referred to here as our \"<strong>websites</strong>\").\nThis privacy policy explains how we\u2014BoardGameGeek, LLC, and our affiliates\u2014use that information and what choices you have about it.</p>\n<p>Our privacy policy applies to <strong>ALL</strong> of our websites, whether you access them through a web browser, a mobile app, or another way.\nOur privacy policy does <strong>NOT</strong> apply to information collected on you by someone else.\nIn those cases, you should consult that person\u2019s privacy policy.</p>\n<p>\n<em>About mobile apps</em>: We do not provide a mobile app.\nHowever, our fans sometimes create unofficial BoardGameGeek mobile apps through which you can access our websites.\n<strong>We are not affiliated with any mobile apps and do not know how they handle your personal information.</strong> Please read each mobile app\u2019s privacy policies before using it.</p>\n<p>\n</p> B.\nOur privacy policy is part of an agreement between you and us.<p>\n</p> Our privacy policy and our Terms of Service apply to you, our \"<strong>users</strong>\", as part of a contract that allows you to browse our website, post on forums, trade games, shop in the BoardGameGeek Store and the Geek Market, and otherwise interact with our websites.\n<br> Keep in mind that BoardGameGeek is a software provider.\nWe do not represent any BoardGameGeek users.\nRather, we develop an online meeting place for those people to share, trade, shop, and learn.\n<strong>We cannot control how other users handle your information.\nPlease be careful when providing your information to other users.</strong>\n<br>\n<br> C.\nOur privacy policy can change from time to time.<p>When we make big changes to our privacy policy, we\u2019ll update the date at the top of this page.\nYour use of our services after we post an updated privacy policy means that you accept and agree to the changes, so please check this page occasionally to make sure that you are up to date.</p>\n<p>\n</p> 2.\nWhat is personal information?<p>\n</p> In basic terms, \"<strong>personal information</strong>\" means information that can directly or indirectly identify you, such as your name, contact information, and in some cases, information about your behavior.<br>\n<p>\u201cPersonal information\u201d does <strong>NOT</strong> include information that we have made anonymous so that it can no longer be used to identify you.\nWe collect anonymized data from our users for internal statistical purposes and for providing our services (such as product ratings, top games, and other trends displayed on our websites).\nWe may pass on this anonymous grouped data to third parties, but it will not be associated with your identity.</p>\n<p>\n</p> 3.\nWhat kind of personal information are you collecting on me?<p>\n</p> We collect information from you in three ways: <br>\n<ol>\n<ol>\n<li>you give it to us directly.\n</li>\n<li>we get it automatically as you use our websites.\nor </li>\n<li>you give it to another user through our websites.</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<p>We only collect as much information about you as is reasonably necessary for us to provide you our services.\nThe table below is a basic

create a public profile.\nYou may include more information on your profile as you desire, such as your full name and location, but remember that it may be accessible to anyone viewing our websites, even if they don\u2019t have an account.</p>\n<p>Any content posted on our websites through your account, such as forum posts, wiki pages, product reviews, marketplace listings, comments, collection listings, recorded plays, images, files, or product descriptions, is referred to as your \"<strong>user contributions</strong>\".\nYour user contributions are accessible by anyone who visits our websites.\nYou should not include any sensitive information in your user contributions.</p>\n<p>When you send a private message to another user through our websites, including for purposes of trades or Geek Market purchases, we will retain the data and content of the message to provide you with a helpful message thread.</p>\n<p>\n</p> 5.\nI\u2019m a user covered by the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d).<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p> A.\nWhat rights do I have under the GDPR?<p>\n</p> You have rights regarding your personal information, including the right to:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>access your information</li>\n<li>change or correct your information</li>\n<li>erase your information</li>\n<li>restrict our use of your personal information under certain circumstances</li>\n<li>obtain your personal information in portable form</li>\n<li>object to our use of your personal information under certain circumstances</li>\n<li>not be subject to profiling that has legal effects on you</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p> B.\nWhat is your lawful basis for using my personal information?<p>\n</p>\n<p>There are a couple of reasons we believe we are allowed to collect, use, and store your personal information under the GDPR.</p>\n<p>\n<em>With your consent</em>.\nWhen you directly give us personal information for a certain purpose or otherwise express your consent, we can use that personal information for that certain purpose.\nIf you consent for us to do so, we may use your personal information to, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>display your public profile;</li>\n<li>facilitate your trades and purchases;</li>\n<li>personalize and improve the advertisements displayed to you on our website;</li>\n<li>send you our marketing emails.\nor</li>\n<li>verify that you are over 16 years of age.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can withdraw your consent at any time.\nPlease contact us if you would like to revoke your prior consent to any of these uses.</p>\n<p>\n<em>For our legitimate interests</em>.\nHowever, we do not always need your express consent to use your information.\nWe can use your personal information as needed for our legitimate interests, so long as those interests do not conflict with your fundamental privacy rights and freedoms.\nThese legitimate interests include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>improving the presentation, operation, and experience of our services.\n</li>\n<li>evaluating and updating our technical infrastructure.\nand</li>\n<li>monitoring and improving the information security of our websites.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>By contract</em>.\nA contract also creates a basis for using your information.\nBy accepting our Terms of Service, a contract is formed between us and you so that we may provide you our services.\nWe can use your personal information as needed to provide our services to you under that contract.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Law, protection, or the public good</em>.\nWe can also use your personal information to comply with our legal obligations, protect the vital interests of our users, and as needed for the public good.\nThis may include using your personal information to prevent and handle potential fraud, security breaches or other prohibited activities.</p>\n<p>\n</p> 6.\nHow long do you store my information?<p>\n</p> If you do not have an account, we will store your personal information as long as needed in the interest of system security, fraud protection, or other legitimate interests.<br> If you have an account, we will store your personal information and user contributions indefinitely.<br> Generally, if you delete your account, we will continue to store your personal information for a short time in case of any issues, and then we will delete it in accordance with our standard procedures and applicable law.\nHowever, for security purposes, we continue to store your technical data for up to eighteen (18) months after your account deletion.<br>\n<p>Generally, if you delete your account, your user contributions will be removed in the same manner as your personal information.\nHowever, you should be careful disclosing information publicly or to other users.\nAlthough most types of user contributions will be removed upon your account deletion, any content you contributed to wiki pages, game descriptions, or other editable pages will remain public.\nAlso, other users may still be able to access their copy of any private messages you sent to them while your account was active.</p>\n<p>Chatroom logs are not stored.\nThat information is deleted shortly after the chatroom closes.</p>\n<p>\n</p> 7.\nWill you use my personal information to contact me?<p>\n</p>\n<p>As needed, we will contact you by email about your account or use of our services.\nAs permitted by law, we may email you to advertise other products or services available from us, or to request that you complete a survey about your use of our services.\nYou may opt out of these communications by clicking the \"unsubscribe\" link within an email or by contacting us at contact@boardgamegeek.com, or just click here.</p>\n<p>We will not pass on your personal information to others that want to market to you without your consent.</p>\n<p>\n</p> 8.\nHow are you tracking me? Can I stop it?<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p> A.\nWe can see some of what you do in our websites.<p>\n</p>\n<p>We use tracking technology (like \"cookies\") to track some of what you do while using our websites.\nCookies are files sent to your browser from a website or app and stored on your device.\nWe assign a different cookie to each device that accesses our websites.\nThat way, we can provide you with a personalized experience based on your behavior on our websites.\nA cookie can, among other things, identify you electronically and store your user preferences.</p>\n<p>\n</p> B.\nOther people can also track you as your use our websites.<p>\n</p>\n<p>Third parties who are uninvolved with BoardGameGeek may collect information about you while you are visiting our website and other websites.\nFor example, third party marketers may use the information they collect on you to show you targeted ads across the web.\nBoardGameGeek works with Google\u2019s advertising platforms to serve you advertisements on our websites, however, Google does not give us access to the information it uses to place ads for you.\nBoardGameGeek also uses Youtube API Services.\nGoogle may use the personal information that they have collected about you on our sites pursuant to their own privacy policy.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about an ad or other targeted content, you should contact the person who placed the ad.</p>\n<p>\n</p> C.\nYou have choices about how you are tracked.<p>\n</p> You are always free to block, delete, or disable tracking technologies if your browser, application, or device so permits.\nHowever, if you do so, you may not be able to take advantage of certain site features.\nFor more information on how you can block, delete, or disable these technologies, please review your browser or device settings.<br>\nIf you do not want us to use your personal information to show you targeted ads for games, accessories, and other products or services we think you\u2019d enjoy, you can opt-out by making the change in your privacy account settings.\nHowever, we may still keep and use your personal information as explained in this privacy policy.<br>\n<p>Opting-out of our targeted ads will not prevent third parties from sending you targeted ads.\nYou can opt out of targeted ads served via specific third party vendors by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s Opt-Out page at http://optout.aboutads.info.\nYou can also opt out of targeted ads and other tracking via our cookie manager.</p>\n<p>\n</p> D.\nWe are not set up to respond to \"Do Not Track\" signals.<p>\n</p>\n<p>You can also set your browser to refuse cookies by sending out a \"Do Not Track\" signal when you go to a website.\nCalifornia law requires us to disclose how we handle such a signal.\nHowever, since there is no standard for how websites should respond to \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signals, we do not support them and sending one won\u2019t change anything we do.</p>\n<p>\n</p> 9.\nWho else do you share my personal information with?<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<em>Other users</em>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If you do business with another user, such as a trade or Geek Market purchase, we will pass on the personal information you provide to the other user, such as your name, address, and phone number, as necessary for them to complete the transaction.\nThey are not allowed to use your personal information for any other purpose.\nPlease contact us if another user is using your personal information inappropriately.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<em>Our partners</em>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Our \"partners\" are the organizations and people that we work with to better provide our services.\nAs needed, we may send your information to our partners to help us communicate with you, provide customer support, or process your payments to us.\nYour information may be stored on our partners\u2019 servers inside or outside of the U.S.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<em>Our BoardGameGeek Store platform</em>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>One of our partners, Shopify, provides the software platform for the BoardGameGeek Store.\nShopify may, for your convenience, collect information about

the order.\nYou can see how ShipStation handles your information by reviewing their privacy policy at https://www.shipstation.com/privacy-policy/.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<em>Our payment processors</em>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You may provide some financial information as part of the payment process, such as credit card numbers, but we are not able to access more than the last four digits of those numbers.\nWe use Stripe, Inc., or another payment processor, to handle user payment services.\nIf you send us payments with a credit card, we may provide your email address to Stripe to allow you to more easily update your payment information.\nSee Stripe\u2019s privacy policy (available at https://stripe.com/privacy) for how they handle your information.\nSee PayPal\u2019s privacy policy

analytics</em>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>We may use third-party web analytics services, including Google Analytics, to collect and analyze the information discussed above, and to engage in auditing, research or reporting.\nThe information (including your IP address) collected by various analytics technologies described above will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive, analyzing usage trends, assisting with fraud prevention, and providing certain

feedback forms, your information may be passed to Zendesk.\nSee Zendesk's privacy policy (https://www.zendesk.com/company/customers-partners/privacy-policy/) for how they handle your personal information.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<em>Our spam filter</em>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>We use Automattic for spam filtering.\nWe provide contents of public posts along with your IP address to Automattic for automated spam filtering.\nSee Automattic's privacy policy, https://automattic.com/privacy-notice/ for how they handle your personal information.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<em>Our backup provider</em>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Our backups are stored encrypted by Arcserve.\nOnly we can decrypt the data.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<em>When we need to for legal or security reasons</em>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>We may have to share your information with the police, the government, a court, or another person as required by law.\nSimilarly, as allowed by applicable law, we may share your information with third parties as needed to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>prevent or take action if we suspect someone is:<ul>\n<li>breaking the law, </li>\n<li>committing fraud, </li>\n<li>threatening to harm someone, or </li>\n<li>violating our Terms of Service.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>protect the rights, property, or safety of ourselves, our users, or a child.\n</li>\n<li>protect the safety and security of our website.\nor </li>\n<li>enable us to take reasonable precautions against liability.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<em>To a new owner of our company</em>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If our business is sold, whether through merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or other transaction or proceeding, your personal information may be shared with the acquiring company and their representatives.\nIf so, we will post a notice on this page and the Terms of Service.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<em>With your permission</em>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>BoardGameGeek will always ask for your permission before sharing your information with third parties for purposes other than those described in our privacy policy.</p>\n<p>\n</p> 10.\nDoes my personal information leave my home country?<p>\n</p>\n<p>BoardGameGeek is located in the U.S.\nIf you are outside

way to the Terms of Service, your or your authorized user\u2019s relationship with BoardGameGeek, or your or your authorized user\u2019s use of our services (collectively referred to as a <strong>\u201cclaim\u201d</strong>) will be resolved <strong>exclusively by final and binding arbitration, rather than by a court or a jury.\nThe only exception to such mandatory arbitration is that you are NOT prohibited from resolving any such dispute or claim as an individual claim in a small claims court.</strong> The exclusive venue for the arbitration shall be Dallas County, Texas.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.</strong> However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the Terms of Service as a court would.</p>\n<p>\n</p> B.\nYou are waiving your right to a jury trial.<p>\n</p>\n<p>If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration <strong>we each waive any right to a jury trial.\nYou acknowledge that you make this jury waiver knowingly, voluntarily, and willingly.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p> C.\nYou will arbitrate under certain laws and rules.<p>\n</p>\n<p>This arbitration provision is entered pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act.\nThe arbitration, and any appeal, shall be governed by the substantive law of the State of Texas and the applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association <strong>(\u201cAAA\u201d)</strong>.\n<br>\nIf, for any reason, the arbitration or appeal cannot be conducted before AAA or pursuant to AAA rules, and the parties cannot agree to an alternative arbitration service or rules, any court of competent jurisdiction in Dallas County, Texas, may appoint an arbitrator or select appropriate arbitration rules to govern the arbitration or appeal.</p>\n<p>\n</p> D.\nThe fees and costs can be split in different ways.<p>\n</p>\n<p>Each party shall pay an equal share of the arbitrator(s)\u2019 fees and costs relating to the arbitration, subject to the arbitrator(s)\u2019 authority to reallocate such fees and costs in his or her discretion.\nIn any event, each party shall be responsible for payment of their own attorney\u2019s fees and legal costs.</p>\n<p>\n</p> E.\nEither of us can try to bring a temporary injunction against the other.<p>\n</p>\n<p>Either party may seek temporary injunctive relief in federal or state court in Dallas County, Texas, exclusively, at any time until the selection of the arbitrator(s) is completed.\nOnce the selection of the arbitrator(s) is completed, the arbitrator(s) shall assume responsibility for any further action or rulings with respect to any such temporary injunction action.\nThe parties consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in the federal and state courts of Dallas County, Texas, solely for the purpose of any such temporary injunction action.</p>\n<p>\n</p> F.\nYou are waiving your right to bring a claim against us as part of a class-action lawsuit.<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We each agree that any dispute, whether arbitrated or brought in small claims court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.</strong> Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, each party agrees to pursue its claims on an individual basis and not to (1) join its claims with any other person or entity\u2019s claims, (2) pursue any claim as a representative of a class, as a private attorney general or in any representative capacity, or (3) participate in a class or collective action or mass action with respect to any claim.\nIt is the express intent of the parties that the arbitrator, or, as applicable, small claims court, shall not have the power to award class or collective relief or to determine or order that the dispute should proceed as a class or collective action, whether in arbitration or in any other forum or venue.\nThe parties understand and acknowledge that by entering into this provision, <strong>we each are waiving our respective rights to have a court or jury adjudicate our claims.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p> G.\nYou elect to use certain appellate rules.<p>\n</p>\n<p>The parties adopt and agree to implement the AAA Optional Appellate Arbitration Rules with respect to any award subject to this arbitration provision.\nWritten notice of appeal shall be provided to the opposing party and the arbitration service and shall comply with the requirements of the AAA Optional Appellate Arbitration Rules or such other arbitration appellate rules to which the parties may agree or which a court may designate pursuant to the process described earlier in this Section.</p>\n<p>\n</p> 16.\nYou can\u2019t assign your rights under these Terms of

Section 15 is not enforced, you submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of the State of Texas for resolving any claim or dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service.</p>\n<p>\n</p> 18.\nEverything that you and BoardGameGeek have agreed on is contained in our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.<p>\n</p>\n<p>These Terms of Service, together with the

or any other term, and BoardGameGeek's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>\n<p>\n</p> 20.\nIf a court finds part of the Terms of Service invalid, it won\u2019t invalidate the whole of the Terms of Service.<p>\n</p>\n<p>If any term or provision of these Terms of Service is held void, invalid, inoperative, or otherwise unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then no other term or provision will be consequently affected, and the remaining terms and provisions will remain in full
