providers, their privacy statements will apply to such relationships.\nSuch service providers may include benefit brokers, your employer (for products and services offered as an employee benefit), contact centers, payment card processors, and marketing, survey, or analytics suppliers.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>With Public Authorities and Legal Proceedings</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In certain instances, it may be necessary for us to disclose any of the personal data we collect to comply with a legal obligation, at the request of public authorities, or as otherwise required by applicable law.\nNo personal data will be disclosed except in response to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A subpoena, warrant, or other legal process issued by a court or other public authority of competent jurisdiction;</li>\n<li>Discovery requests or demands as part of a civil lawsuit or similar legal process;</li>\n<li>Where disclosure is necessary for us to enforce our legal rights pursuant to applicable law;</li>\n<li>A request with the purpose of identifying and/or preventing credit card fraud or identity theft.\nor</li>\n<li>Where disclosure of personal data is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat of bodily or other significant harm to the data subject or other individuals potentially concerned.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>For Restoration Services</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may disclose your user data, security data, diagnostic information, and third-party data to financial institutions, financial services companies, and other third parties at your direction to provide restoration services and other Services to you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>With Third-Party Service Providers</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you access third-party services through our Services, these third-party services may be able to collect user data, security data, diagnostic information, and third-party data about you in accordance with their own privacy policies.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>With Our Corporate Affiliates</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may share all of the information we collect with our corporate affiliates.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>For Business Transfers</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may share all of the information we collect in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of a website, a merger, acquisition, consolidation, asset sale, or initial public offering, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</p>\n<strong>Retention and Deletion of Your Personal Data</strong>\n<p>We will keep your personal data on our systems as long as necessary to provide you with our Services, or for as long as we have another legitimate business purpose to do so, but not longer than permitted or required by law.\nWhen we no longer have an ongoing legitimate business reason to keep your personal data, your personal data will either be securely disposed of, or de-identified through an appropriate anonymization means, such as aggregation, truncation, or one-way hashing so it is no longer identifiable as your personal data.</p>\n<strong>Cross-Border Transfers of Personal Data Among NortonLifeLock Entities and to Third-Party Vendors</strong>\n<p>We are a global company and process personal data in many countries.\nAs part of our business, your personal data may be transferred to NortonLifeLock and/or its subsidiaries and affiliates in the United States, and to subsidiaries and third-party vendors of NortonLifeLock located worldwide.\nAll transfers will occur in compliance with the applicable data transfer requirements laws and regulations.</p>\n<p>If your personal data originates from the European Economic Area and is transferred to NortonLifeLock subsidiaries, affiliates, or third-party vendors engaged by NortonLifeLock to process such personal data on our behalf who are located in countries that are not recognized by the European Commission as offering an adequate level of personal data protection, such transfers are covered by alternate appropriate safeguards, specifically Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission.</p>\n<p>If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition, or sale of our assets, your personal data may be transferred as part of that transaction.<br>\n</p>\n<strong>How We Protect Your Personal Data</strong>\n<p>Securing personal data is an important aspect of protecting privacy.\nWe take reasonable and appropriate

and apply secure destruction to media containing personal data.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Technical Safeguards</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We implement and use reasonably available state-of-the-art network and information security standards, protocols, and technologies, including encryption, intrusion detection, and data loss prevention, and we monitor our systems and data centers to comply with our security policies.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Organizational Safeguards</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We conduct regular company-wide as well as role-specific training and awareness programs on security and

when you visit certain websites owned by third parties.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We use different kinds of cookies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Essential cookies</strong> are necessary to provide you with Services and features available through our websites.\nWithout these cookies, services you may need, such as shopping carts or e-billing, cannot be provided.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Advertising cookies

from your browser.\nIf you would like to view or manage the cookies we use, please see our cookie banner which is displayed when you first access our website, or the \u201cprivacy settings\u201d tab located on the lower right hand of our websites.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third-Party Data Collection</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Cookies may also be placed on our websites by third parties to deliver tailored information and content that may be of interest to you, such as promotions or offerings, when you visit third-party websites after you have left ours.\nWe do not permit these third parties to collect personal data about you on our sites beyond such cookies (e.g., email address) unless such data is provided to the third party in their role as a service provider acting solely on our behalf.<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Social Media Features and Widgets</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our websites include social media features, such as Facebook\u2019s \u201cLike\u201d button, and widgets, such as the \u201cShare This\u201d button, or interactive mini-programs that run on our sites.\nThese features are usually recognizable by their third-party brand or logo and may collect your IP address or other personal data, including which page you are visiting on our websites, and set a cookie to enable the feature to work properly.\nAny collection of information through such third-party feature is governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Some mobile

Profiling</strong>\n<p>Where NortonLifeLock processes network traffic data for the purpose of network and information security based on our or our customers\u2019 legitimate interest as outlined in the corresponding section of this Statement, automated decisions concerning data elements may occasionally be made.\nThis could involve assigning relative cybersecurity reputation scores to IP addresses and URLs based on objective cyber-threat indicators measured by our and our partners\u2019 cyber-threat detection engines.\nSuch indicators may be, for instance, the determination that malicious or otherwise harmful contents are hosted at a given URL or are coming from a given IP address.\nSuch automatically assigned reputation scores may be leveraged by you, by NortonLifeLock, by our partners, and by other customers to detect, block, and mitigate the identified cyber threats.\nThey could therefore result in our Services blocking network traffic coming from or going to such URLs and IP addresses.\nThis processing is intended only to protect you, NortonLifeLock, our partners, and our other customers from cyber threats.\nIf you consider that such automated processing is unduly affecting you in a significant way, please contact us as explained above (\u201cContact Us\u201d) to raise your concerns and to seek our help in finding a satisfactory solution.<strong>\n<u>\n</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<strong>Children\u2019s Privacy</strong>\n<p>Our websites are not directed to, nor do we knowingly collect data from, minors (as defined by applicable

cases, we will only collect, and process personal data related to any child under 13 years of age that you choose to disclose to us or otherwise instruct us to collect and process.\nPlease refer to the Product Specific Privacy Statements for additional information.</p>\n<strong>Changes to this Statement</strong>\n<p>We reserve the right to revise or modify this Statement.\nIn addition, we may update this Privacy Statement to reflect changes to our data practices.\nIf we make any material changes in the way we collect, process, and/or share your personal data, we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this website prior to the change becoming effective.\nIn the case of a material change to our personal data processing practices, any such change will only apply on a going-forward basis.\nWe will not process the personal data currently in our possession in a materially different way without your prior consent.\nWe encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.<strong>\n<u>\n</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<strong>Links to Other Websites</strong>\n<p>Our websites may
