you use for the purpose of administering your subscription and for the purpose to enjoy our VPN services.\nExcept for the limited exceptions, we don't automatically collect any Personal Information from you.</p>\n<p>When you open the APP seeking for our VPN services, the APP assigns a unique identifier to you for the service (such unique identifier just binds up with your device identification

choose to not receive Marketing emails by following the opt-out procedure described in these emails.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Innovative uses your personal information only for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy, and we don't sell your personal information to third parties without your prior consent.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nSERVICE INFORMATION RELATED TO YOUR VPN USAGE</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Subject to applicable laws and for the avoidance to infringe any internet service provider, any browsing information, traffic destination, data content, IP addresses, DNS queries or other similar information

you visit or any data stored on or transmitted from your device, including any data that applications on your device may transmit through the VPN network.\nMore specifically, Innovative has NO documents/information below under the situations of the limited connecting with your personal information and the non-collection of the websites you visit or any data stored on or transmitted from your device:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We do not know which user ever accessed a particular website or service.</li>\n<li>We do not know which user was connected to the VPN at a specific time.</li>\n<li>We do not know the set of original IP addresses of a user's computer or the temporarily assigned network addresses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If anyone would like to access to or try to compel Innovative to release user information based on any of the above, we cannot supply this information because the data don't exist.</p>\n<p>For the purpose to fulfill our contractual obligations in good faith and to make you enjoy excellent VPN services, we collect the following information related to your VPN usage:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information related to Apps and Apps versions</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We collect information related to which Apps and Apps version(s) you have activated.\nIt makes our Support Team efficiently find out and eliminate technical issues for you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information related to Connection</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We collect information about whether a VPN connection is successful on a particular day (but not a specific time of the day), to which VPN location (but not your assigned

service, we may seek for the reason with the user.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Anonymous Data for Network Diagnostics, Study and Analysis</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you become one of our users for the VPN services, with your permission, we collect minimal usage statistics and anonymized analytics data used for network diagnostics in our network operations tools, for the purpose to optimize network speeds and to let us identify problems related to specific apps, VPN servers, or ISPs.\nLearning and analyzing the statistics allows us to improve the quality of the services and the products.\nWe ensure the information we receive is fully anonymized and cannot be tied back to individual users (i.e., we do not store which user sent which data, and we do not store IP addresses).</p>\n<p>We will collect the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Diagnostic information about if and how a VPN connection attempt failed.</li>\n<li>Speed test data.</li>\n<li>Crash reports, also without any

speed, we can't uniquely identify any specific behavior of any user, because thousands of users share one same location simultaneously to enjoy surfing the internet and the usage pattern overlaps with thousands of other customers who also connected to the same location on the same day.</p>\n<p>Regarding to the sensitive data, we've engineered our systems to categorically eliminate the storage of sensitive data.\nWe never know HOW they have utilized our Service.\n</p>\n<p>We stand by our firm commitment to our customers' privacy by not possessing any data related to a user's online

LAW</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Keeping your information private is our core mission.\nIn service of this mission, Innovative's registered place of business is in Singapore, where has integrated data protection legislation.</p>\n<p>There are no special data retention laws and no guidance pertaining to e-discovery or disclosure to foreign law enforcement agencies in Singapore.\nThe disclosure of personal data may follow this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>Required by any foreign law enforcement agencies, Innovative turns over protected user information only upon receipt of a valid subpoena, court order, or search warrant, which shall be served effectively under the Rules of Court of Singapore.\nMore specifically, we think the subpoena, court order or search warrant may lose its coercive effect when it crosses its boundary.\nIt only regains coercive effect on the other side of the line either through a domestication action (in the other state's courts) or under the authority of a statute.\nAdditionally, we will notify affected users about any requests for their account information, unless prohibited from doing so by law or court order.\nShould we receive a valid served legal order, it is important to note that Innovative does not collect any IP addresses, browsing history, traffic data, or DNS queries that could be used to identify any specific user.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nDATA RETENTION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements).</p>\n<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>\n<p>We keep records of any correspondence, questions, complaints, or compliments you submit to us, along with our response.\nDepending on how you contact us, we may collect your email address and any additional information you provide to us.\nHaving full correspondence records enables us to provide the best

important to understand that no data security measures in the world can offer 100% protection.</p>\n<p>Servers are housed in data centers with strong security practices.\nNone of these data centers require us to collect or store any traffic data or personal information related to your use of VPN services.\nIf any data center were to ask us to log such data, we would immediately cease operations with said data center and find alternative options.</p>\n<p>Even if a government were to physically seize one of our VPN servers and manage to break its disk encryption, there would be no logs or information that would tie any individual user to a particular event, website, or behavior.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.\nTHIRD-PARTY SERVICES</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may access other third-party services

the customers who choose free VPN services.\n</p>\n<p> We ensure that we do not target any personal information based on these ads.\nAlthough you opt in to use the free, advertising-supported VPN

mission, Innovative's registered place of business is in Singapore, where has integrated data protection legislation.\n</p>\n<p> There are no special data retention laws and no guidance pertaining to e-discovery or disclosure to foreign law enforcement agencies in Singapore.\nThe disclosure of personal data may follow this Privacy Policy.\n</p>\n<p> Required by any foreign law enforcement agencies, Innovative turns over protected user information only upon receipt of a valid subpoena, court order, or search warrant, which shall be served effectively under the Rules of Court of Singapore.\nMore specifically, we think the subpoena, court order or search warrant may lose its coercive effect when it crosses its boundary.\nIt only regains coercive effect on the other side of the line either through a domestication action (in the other state's courts) or under the authority of a statute.\nAdditionally, we will notify affected users about any requests for their account information, unless prohibited from doing so by law or court order.\nShould we receive a valid served legal order, it is important to note that Innovative does not collect any IP addresses, browsing history, traffic data, or DNS queries that could be used to identify any specific user.<br>\n<b>\n<br>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>6.\nDATA RETENTION</b>\n</p>\n<p> We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements).\n</p>\n<p> When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.\n</p>\n<p> We keep records of any correspondence, questions, complaints, or compliments you submit to us, along with our response.\nDepending on how you contact us, we may collect your email address and any additional information you provide to us.\nHaving full correspondence records enables us to provide the best possible customer support experience.\n</p>\n<p> We use emails for support correspondence:

security with respect to our offices and information storage facilities so as to prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of information.\nAccess to user information is restricted to staff who require such access to perform their job functions.\n</p>\n<p> While we believe these systems are robust, it is important to understand that no data security measures in the world can offer 100% protection.\n</p>\n<p> Servers are housed in data centers with strong security practices.\nNone of these data centers require us to collect or store any traffic data or personal information related to your use of VPN services.\nIf any data center were to ask us to log such data, we would immediately cease operations with said data center and find alternative options.\n</p>\n<p> Even if a government were to physically seize one of our VPN servers and manage to break its disk encryption, there would be no logs or information that would tie any individual user to a particular event, website, or behavior.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<br>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>8.\nTHIRD-PARTY SERVICES</b>\n</p>\n<p> You may access other third-party services while using the VPN
