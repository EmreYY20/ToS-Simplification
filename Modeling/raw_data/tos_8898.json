mobile devices and PCs will give you access to any websites and will encrypt traffic from the user's device to the service\u2019s server.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</strong>\n<p>a) Please refer to Privacy Notice for contact details.</p>\n<p>b) Red Shield VPN is a privacy enhancing service operating within the European Union legal framework and technological solutions.</p>\n<p>c) Red Shield VPN is a Virtual Private Network which encrypts the data sent and received on the Internet.\nOutgoing data is encrypted before leaving your computer, decrypted by one of Red Shield VPN servers and routed to the Internet.\nIncoming data is encrypted from one of Red Shield VPN servers and are decrypted only when they are inside your computer.\nOutgoing data packets do not contain your IP address when they are on the Internet, instead they have the IP address of one of Red Shield VPN servers.</p>\n<p>d) Red Shield VPN uses OpenVPN and/or IPSec and/or OpenConnect and RedLink protocol&nbsp.\nto establish the connection between your computer and the servers.\nOpenVPN and IPSec are the most reliable and secure solutions for encrypted tunnels.</p>\n<p>e) Red Shield VPN encrypts your Internet data when you are connected to one of the Red Shield VPN servers.\nWhen you are not connected, Red Shield VPN enhancing privacy and anonymization layer services are not active.\nAll applications launched AFTER you connect to the VPN service will use the service - no configuration is needed.</p>\n<p>f) Red Shield VPN fully complies with the European Union directives which protect your privacy: Directive on Data Protection (95/46/EC) and Directive concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy (2002/58/EC).\nUsing the service implies that you have read and understood our Privacy Notice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>How does it work?</strong>\n<p>Our applications allow you to create an encrypted tunnel to our servers in the selected country with just one click.<br>Then you simply use the Internet as if you are in the country that you have chosen to connect to.<br>This allows you to bypass locks, hide from third parties - special services, Internet providers and hackers the data you transmit, and what resources you use.<br>We do not keep logs of your connections or traffic - accordingly, we do not transfer them to third parties.<br>Unlike free VPN and proxy services, we do not earn on the analysis and sale of user traffic.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>Gift a
