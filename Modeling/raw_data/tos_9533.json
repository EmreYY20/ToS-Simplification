Technologies set by the Site, you have a number of options: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can prevent or exercise choices regarding the use of certain Tracking Technologies for a particular Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls in your Internet browser as described in Section 5.2.3 below.\nPlease note that using those controls may affect Tracking Technologies which are browser cookies but may not affect other Tracking Technologies such as Flash LSOs.</li>\n<li>See Section 5.2.3 below for additional information about managing Tracking Technologies set by the Site and for information on your choices regarding Identifiers on mobile platforms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.2.3.\nMore Information on Managing Tracking Technologies.</strong> With respect to the Tracking Technologies set by the Site, Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, please note the following with respect to the above opt-out options: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>More Information About Cookie Controls.\nFor the following Internet browsers, you may prevent or exercise choices regarding browser cookies for a particular Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls described in the following: Internet Explorer 11, Chrome, Safari, Firefox.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your Internet browser is not listed above or you otherwise are having difficulties with the links, you may be able to access controls to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delete existing browser cookies through the \u201cInternet Options\u201d, \u201cSettings\u201d, Preferences\u201d, \u201cOptions\u201d or similar menu selection in your browser\u2019s menu or otherwise as directed by your browser\u2019s support feature, which means that all pre-existing browser cookies are deleted but does not prevent browser cookies from being used in the future.</li>\n<li>Disable browser cookies through the same browser controls which means that browser cookies shall not be used in the future but pre-existing browser cookies may not be deleted.\nAdditional information on enabling or disabling browser cookies and other Tracking Technologies may be available through your browser\u2019s support feature.\n(See the \u201chelp\u201d section of your browser for more information.) Disabling may sometimes be referred to as blocking or opting out of browser cookies and relies on browser cookies to remember your choices.\nIf you delete browser cookies using the controls in your Web browser (as described above) after disabling browser cookies, you may have to disable browser cookies again to re-establish your preferences.</li>\n<li>Choose to have the Device you use to access the Site warn you each time a browser cookie or certain other non-Flash LSO Tracking Technology is being set.\n(You can later choose to turn-off such warnings.) This may be available through your Internet browser on the Device you use to access the Site.\nAdditional information on warnings and removal of warnings may be available through your browser\u2019s support feature.</li>\n<li>Seek additional information from the provider of your Internet browser through your browser\u2019s support features.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above options may cover browser cookies set by the Site, browser cookies not set by the Site (sometimes called third party cookies) and/or both types of browser cookies.\n<strong>PLEASE NOTE THAT WE DO NOT CONTROL AND ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OPERATION OF THESE BROWSER COOKIE CONTROLS.\nALSO, PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE BROWSER COOKIE CONTROLS ARE DIFFERENT FROM DO NOT TRACK OPTIONS THAT MAY ALSO BE OFFERED BY CERTAIN BROWSERS.</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Many tools discussed above are \u201cInternet browser cookie based.\u201d This means that such tools rely on cookies to remember your choices.\nFor example, if you delete Tracking Technologies using the controls in your Web browser after disabling such Tracking Technologies, you may have to disable such Tracking Technologies again to re-establish your preferences and, if you exercise opt-outs through the mechanisms herein, and then delete or block browser cookies, you may need to exercise your opt-outs through these mechanisms again.</li>\n<li>The tools are \u201cInternet browser and Device-specific\u201d or \u201cDevice-specific\u201d Note that when you exercise your options using controls for the Internet browser, your choices shall only apply to the specific Internet browser on that Device and not across Devices.\nThis means, for example, that if you block or disable browser cookies for Internet Explorer 9 on one Device, this choice shall not block or disable browser cookies when you use Mozilla Firefox on the same Device or on a different Device using Internet Explorer 9.\nFurther, you may need to separately exercise your options for other platforms, such as mobile platform (as described below).</li>\n<li>Automatic Disabling of Third Party Cookies and Effect on Certain Opt-Outs.\nSome Device manufacturers and/or browsers (such as Safari) may preset their browser to automatically disable browser cookies from websites, applications or other interactive services other than those you visit directly (sometimes referred to as third party cookies) and, if so, the opt-out choices you have exercised with regard to third parties may not function and you may need to enable third party cookies in order for your opt-out choices to function.\nFor example, unless you enable third party cookies on Safari, your opt-out choices made on the Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising site and on the Network Advertising Initiative site may not function.</li>\n<li>You shall still receive advertisements.\nDeleting or disabling Third Party Service Providers\u2019, Advertisers\u2019 or the Site\u2019s Tracking Technologies does not mean that you shall no longer receive online ads.\nIf you delete or disable third party Tracking Technologies (or, if third party Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled, if you do not enable such Tracking Technologies), this only means that such ads may no longer be tailored to your specific viewing habits or interests, but you shall continue to see ads on this Site and you may see the same advertisement repeatedly or may see advertisements more frequently unless you enable Tracking Technologies set by third parties or unless we offer alternative means such as enlisting the assistance of Third Party Service Providers in order for the Site to set Tracking Technologies for frequency capping purposes as described in Section 3.2 above.</li>\n<li>Limitations Regarding Web Beacons.\nWeb beacons cannot be deleted or disabled using the above opt-out options, but may be affected if such web beacons rely on browser cookies or other deleted or disabled Tracking Technologies to track your activities.</li>\n<li>How to Manage Flash LSOs (sometimes known as Flash Cookies).\nCONTROL OF FLASH LSOS (SOMETIMES KNOWN AS FLASH COOKIES) MUST BE HANDLED SEPARATELY.\nPLEASE NOTE THAT THE USE AND STORAGE OF FLASH LSOs TYPICALLY CANNOT BE CONTROLLED THROUGH YOUR INTERNET BROWSER.\nDeleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers and set by this Site through the above options shall not remove Flash LSOs.\nFor more information about Flash LSOs and how to remove them from your computer, please visit http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html.\nIf you remove Flash LSOs, you may not have access to certain features of the Site and some of our other services may not function properly.</li>\n<li>Other Effects of Managing Tracking Technologies.\nIn addition to the above, if you delete or disable Tracking Technologies set by the Site, the Site may no longer be able to offer certain features or functionality to you, such as remembering your preferences, remembering your username, saving your player settings or other purposes described in Section 4.2 above, and some of our other services may not function properly.\nIn addition to the above, if you disable or delete Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers (or if such Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled on your Device or browser), the Site may no longer be able to offer certain functionality to you, such as enabling SMN login or saving your player settings and certain services or advertisements may not work for such Devices or browsers.</li>\n<li>Mobile Platforms.\nCertain mobile platforms, such as Apple or Google, may offer users choice regarding the Identifiers we, Third Party Service Providers or Advertisers may access and use, which may not be browser cookie based.\nWe encourage you to review and understand the choices that such mobile platforms may provide to you regarding these Identifiers.</li>\n<li>Certain Identifiers.\nCertain Identifiers we set may not be deleted, blocked or disabled using the above opt-out options, but may be affected if such Identifiers rely on, or are associated with, browser cookies or other Tracking Technologies.</li>\n<li>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.\nSome web browsers may transmit \u201cdo-not-track\u201d signals to the websites with which the browser communicates.\nBecause of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.\nThere currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.\nWe currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and accepted, or if and when required by applicable law or regulation, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.\nInstead, as described above, please see the link to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising program that we follow that offers you choice regarding Information collected for Customized Advertising purposes and the browser cookie controls and other mechanisms described in this Section 5.2.3 and in Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>6.\n[reserved]</strong>\n<strong>7.\nSharing and Disclosure of Information.</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>7.1 Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Information.</strong>

regulatory recordkeeping requirements and shall not be deleted upon the user\u2019s request, unless the entrant is a child under the age of 13 years old.\n</p>\n<p>If the burden or expense of

personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising, and limits the use of \u201cSensitive Personal Information,\u201d as defined by the law and described below.\nIt also provides that California residents have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for exercising the privacy rights described in this notice.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.1 Categories of Personal Information Collected, Purpose for Collection, and Categories of Third Parties with whom CA Personal Information is Disclosed for a Business Purpose.</strong> The definition of personal information under California law (\u201cCA Personal Information\u201d) is broader than the definition of Personal Information in this privacy policy and includes information we collect from you as well as Identifiers

Information on the Site for Customized Advertising and other purposes described in Section 3.2.2 to be a \u201cSale \u201c or \u201cSharing\u201d of personal information under California law.\nCA Residents can opt out of the Sale and/or Sharing of their CA Personal Information by clicking on the CA Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Info link.\nWe do not knowingly Sell or Share the CA Personal

Residents may correct and update inaccurate CA Personal Information as described in Section 8 above.\nWe will only be able to honor such requests for CA Residents whose identities we can

ARBITRATION.\nNO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS OR ARBITRATIONS</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>19.1 Binding Arbitration and Exclusions from Arbitration.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW OR UNLESS YOU SUBMIT A VALID ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT NOTICE (AS DESCRIBED IN&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>SECTION 19.5</strong>\n<strong>), ANY AND ALL CLAIMS BETWEEN YOU AND CHEDDAR WILL BE RESOLVED IN BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT.</strong>&nbsp;You and Cheddar agree to submit to individual arbitration the resolution of any and all Claims by or between you and/or Cheddar,&nbsp;<strong>except that you and Cheddar agree that the following will not be subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions in this&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>Section 19.1</strong>\n<strong>:</strong>&nbsp;(A) any Claim filed by you or Cheddar with respect to any violation, enforcement or validity of patent, trademark, trade dress, service mark, copyright and/or trade secret rights of you, Cheddar, or any third party, including, but not limited to, Claims related to content that you upload to or share on the Site and/or (B) you or Cheddar may seek a preliminary injunction, restraining order or other provisional equitable relief in any court as provided in&nbsp;Section 20&nbsp;in connection with any Claim whereby you or Cheddar, as applicable, may suffer immediate and irreparable harm for which money damages may be inadequate and impossible to calculate (including, but not limited to, a Claim under&nbsp;Section 19.1(A)), where such Claim under this&nbsp;Section 19.1(B)&nbsp;will not be subject to the informal dispute resolution procedures described in&nbsp;Section 19.2&nbsp;below;&nbsp;provided, however, that, subsequent to obtaining such preliminary injunction, restraining order or other provisional equitable relief, the Claim will then be submitted to arbitration in accordance with&nbsp;Section 19.\nYou and Cheddar agree that this Agreement affects interstate commerce, and that the enforceability of&nbsp;Section 19&nbsp;will be governed by, construed, and enforced, both procedurally and substantively, by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\nsections 1-9 (\"FAA\").\nArbitration is the referral of a dispute to one or more impartial persons for a final and binding determination.\nThere is no judge or jury in arbitration, discovery is more limited than in court, there are no class or representative proceedings, and court review of an arbitration decision is limited.\nAn arbitrator must follow this Agreement and can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including, but not limited to, injunctive and declaratory relief, statutory damages, and attorneys' fees).\n\"Claim(s)\" means any dispute, claim or controversy by or between you and/or Cheddar relating to the Site and/or this Agreement (including, but not limited to, this Site's Privacy Policy and all Additional Terms, Rules, regulations, procedures and policies which we refer to in this Agreement), as may be modified from time-to-time, and the subject matter hereof, including, but not limited to, any contract, tort, statutory, or equity claims.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19.2 Informal Dispute Resolution.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Except with respect to Claims described in&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>Section 19.1(B)</strong>\n<strong>&nbsp;above, before either you or Cheddar pursue or participate in any Claim against the other party in arbitration or court proceedings, you or Cheddar must notify the other party of the Claim in writing at least 60 days in advance of initiating the arbitration or court proceeding in order to provide a reasonable opportunity to resolve the Claim.&nbsp;</strong>You may send a written notice of your Claim to Cheddar at 1 State St., New York, NY 10004, Attention: Cheddar, Inc.\nGeneral Counsel.\nCheddar may send written or electronic notice of its Claim to your email address, Cheddar account or any physical or other address Cheddar has for you.\nThe notice must describe the Claim in reasonable detail and set forth the relief requested so that the other party has an opportunity to adequately address the Claim.\nExcept with respect to Claims described in&nbsp;Section 19.1(B)&nbsp;above, you and Cheddar agree to negotiate in good faith with each other to try to informally resolve the Claim and, if you and Cheddar do not reach an informal resolution of the Claim within 60 days, then the Claim may be submitted to binding arbitration as set forth in&nbsp;Section 19&nbsp;or court as permitted by&nbsp;Section 19.1.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19.3 Arbitration Proceedings and Costs.</strong>\n</p>\n<p> In the event that the Parties are unable to resolve any Claim informally, then such Claim shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration.&nbsp.\nThe arbitration shall be initiated and conducted according to either the JAMS Streamlined (for claims under $250,000) or the JAMS Comprehensive (for claims over $250,000) Arbitration Rules and Procedures, except as modified herein, including the Optional Appeal Procedure, at the office of JAMS at the location set forth in Section 20, or its successor (\u201cJAMS\u201d) in effect at the time the request for arbitration is made (the \u201cArbitration Rules\u201d).&nbsp.\nIf you initiate the arbitration proceedings, you must send a copy of any initiating forms to Cheddar, which should be sent to Cheddar at the following address: 1 State St., New York, NY 10004&nbsp.\nAttention: Cheddar Inc.\nGeneral Counsel.\nThe parties agree that the costs of the arbitration (excluding attorney\u2019s fees) will be shared pro rata to the extent permitted by law, except you agree to reimburse Cheddar for all fees associated with the arbitration (including attorneys fees) paid by Cheddar in the event the arbitrator determines that the Claim(s) you assert in the arbitration are frivolous or vexatious.&nbsp.\nThe arbitration shall be conducted before a single neutral arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Arbitration Rules.&nbsp.\nThe arbitrator shall follow New York substantive law and the Federal Rules of Evidence in adjudicating the Dispute.&nbsp.\nIn all cases, you and Cheddar shall exchange documents and other information that you or Cheddar intend to use in the arbitration.&nbsp.\nThe arbitrator will provide a detailed written statement of decision, which will be part of the arbitration award and admissible in any judicial proceeding to confirm, correct or vacate the award.&nbsp.\nUnless the Parties agree otherwise, the neutral arbitrator and the members of any appeal panel shall be former or retired judges or justices of any New York state or federal court with experience in matters involving the industry.&nbsp.\nIf either party refuses to perform any or all of its obligations under the final arbitration award (following appeal, if applicable) within thirty (30) days of such award being rendered, then the other party may enforce the final award in any court of competent jurisdiction in New York County.&nbsp.\nThe party seeking enforcement shall be entitled to an award of all costs, fees and expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees, incurred in enforcing the award, to be paid by the party against whom enforcement is ordered.&nbsp.\nThe parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and the Award, including the arbitration hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an Award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19.4 Class Action Waiver.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>UNLESS YOU SUBMIT A VALID ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT NOTICE (AS DESCRIBED IN&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>SECTION 19.5</strong>\n<strong>), YOU AND CHEDDAR AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.</strong>&nbsp;You and Cheddar expressly agree that any Claim is personal to you and Cheddar, shall only be resolved by an individual arbitration (or individual court proceedings with respect to Claims excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in&nbsp;Section 19.1&nbsp;of this Agreement), and shall in no event be brought as a class arbitration, a class action, or any other representative proceeding.\nThe arbitrator (or court if the Claim is excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in&nbsp;Section 19.1&nbsp;of this Agreement) may only conduct an individual arbitration (or court action if the Claim is excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in&nbsp;Section 19.1&nbsp;of this Agreement), and may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding.\nIf a court or arbitrator determines that this class action waiver is unenforceable in an action between you and Cheddar, then this Agreement to arbitrate will be unenforceable.\nNeither you nor Cheddar consent to class arbitration.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19.5 Right to Opt Out of Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISIONS
