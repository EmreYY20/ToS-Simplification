then refresh this page.\nOur Privacy Policy <p>This Privacy Policy helps to ensure that Windcave complies with applicable law in the countries in which we operate, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) promulgated by the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) promulgated by the State of California.</p>\n<p>We at Windcave take your privacy seriously, and will only use your personal information for the purposes permitted by law and this Privacy Policy.\nPlease read our Privacy Policy, and let us know if you have questions.</p> Who is Windcave? <p>Windcave is a group of companies consisting of Windcave Limited, its affiliates, and its subsidiaries (collectively, \u201cWindcave\u201d).\nWindcave provides technical solutions to businesses by allowing them to process payments in e-commerce, and via physical payment devices, such as card readers.</p> Windcave Protects Your Personal Information at Least Up to the Standards Set Forth by PCI-DSS <p>Windcave is committed to protecting your privacy whenever you buy goods or services from a merchant that uses Windcave payment solutions (\u201cMerchant\u201d).\nMerchants will generally use Windcave's payment solutions when customer uses a credit or debit payment card over the internet, telephone, fax, unattended or integrated electronic funds transfer at the point of sale (\u201cEFTPOS\u201d) system (collectively \u201cTransactions\u201d).</p> Windcave recognizes its responsibility to keep all personal information confidential at all times.\nAny information that Windcave acquires in connection with such Transactions is kept confidential, whether the information is acquired directly from a cardholder or Merchant.\nWindcave protects personal information - at a minimum - to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (\u201cPCI-DSS\u201d).\nTo learn more about PCI-DSS, please see our PCI-DSS section below, or visit the PCI Security Standards Council\u2019s website, at: PCI Standard Website <p>\n</p>\n<p>Please note, however, that Windcave's responsibility is limited to protection of information that is obtained by Windcave.\nWindcave itself cannot control the use or disclosure by your Merchant of any information that it obtains from you.</p> How We Collect Information <p>To enable Windcave to provide secure payment facilities, we acquire information which may include a cardholder's name, credit card number (with the expiry date) and billing address.\nThat information is collected when a card and its information is provided to a Windcave payment solution.</p> How We Use and Disclose Information <p>Windcave uses the information it collects to obtain authorization for Transactions from the payment card\u2019s issuing bank (the bank that issued your credit or debit card) and from Windcave's own or the Merchant's bank (the \u201cacquirer\u201d or \u201cAcquiring Bank\u201d).\nSome details from the Transaction (such as name, email and delivery address) may be made available to the Merchant or Acquiring Bank through Payline - Windcave\u2019s web-based transactions management system.\nPayline allows Merchants to track Transactions and process refunds.\nPayment card numbers are encrypted and stored by Windcave securely, and are not provided to the Merchant.\nPlease note that your personal data may be shared with legal authorities if required by law.\nIn addition, and separate from its performance of the services set forth in this Privacy Policy, Windcave may aggregate and disclose the aggregated data that is not personally identifiable to its partners or third parties.\nThis aggregated, non-identifiable data may be used for statistical analysis or similar purposes.</p> Security <p>Windcave is committed to data security.\nWindcave uses a variety of technologies and procedures to help protect personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.\nFor example, Windcave stores the data in computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities secured by advanced surveillance and security technology.\nWhen Windcave transmits sensitive information (such as a payment card number), Windcave protects it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (\u201cSSL\u201d) protocol.\nCredit card details stored onsite are encrypted using 168bit 3DES encryption.\nWindcave is a level 1 certified PCI-DSS compliant provider.</p> What is PCI-DSS? PCI-DSS, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, is a set of security requirements relating to the protection of cardholder data.\nPCI-DSS is governed by the Payment Card Industry (\u201cPCI\u201d) Security Standards Council, an organisation put together by the major card schemes - VISA, MasterCard, American Express, JCB and Discover.\nPCI-DSS is relevant to any entity that stores or transmits sensitive cardholder data, which consists of information such as the PAN (card number), card security code, track data, and PIN block.\nPreceding PCI-DSS, the card schemes had their own standards, and the VISA Account Information Security (AIS) standard formed the basis to most of the PCI-DSS requirements.\nSelect this link to view our PCI-DSS compliance certificate.\n<p>\n</p> Storage of Information <p>Windcave may transfer your information to countries outside of your country of residence, and those countries may have information protection rules that are different from those of your country of residence.\nGenerally, Windcave stores and processes information in countries where we operate offices, such as New Zealand, Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom.\nWindcave takes measures to ensure that information transfers comply with applicable data protection laws and that your information remains protected to the standards described in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>Although we do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site.\nany transmission is at your own risk and you accept all liability for such risk, to the extent legally permissible.\nOnce we have received your information, we use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p> Transfer of Personal Data Outside European Economic Area <p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to and stored at a destination outside of the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), including, but not limited to, in New Zealand, Australia, and the United States.\nIt may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for

improve user experience.\nThese include Windcave entities in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and in some instances, Australia.\nGenerally, sharing such information is necessary for us to perform on our contract with you \u2013 for example, to provide technical support after normal business hours.\nWe may provide additional notice and ask for your prior consent if we wish to share your Personal Information with our commonly owned entities in a materially different way than discussed in this privacy statement.</p> Your California Privacy Rights <p>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act or
