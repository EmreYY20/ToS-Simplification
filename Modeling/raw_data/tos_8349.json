you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), and in this section of our Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why is this data collected, and how we maintain this data under protection from being replicated or used in the wrong way.</p>What is GDPR?<p>GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents' data is protected by companies and enhances the control the EU residents have, over their personal data.</p>\n<p>The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not just the EU-based businesses and EU residents.\nOur customers\u2019 data is important irrespective of where they are located, which is why we have implemented GDPR controls as our baseline standard for all our operations worldwide.</p>What is personal data?<p>Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual.\nGDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person.\nPersonal data extends beyond a person\u2019s name or email address.\nSome examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.</p>\n<p>The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u2022 Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.</li>\n<li>\u2022 Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that purpose.\nOrganizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.</li>\n<li>\u2022 Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.</li>\n<li>\u2022 People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data.\nThey can also request a copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.</li>\n</ul>Why is GDPR important?<p>GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals' personal data that they collect and process.\nIt also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach.\nBeyond these facts it's simply the right thing to do.\nAt Superb Games we strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.</p>Individual Data Subject's Rights - Data Access, Portability and Deletion<p>We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject rights requirements of GDPR.\nSuperb Games processes or stores all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors.\nWe do store all conversation and personal data for up to 6 years unless your account is deleted.\nIn which case, we dispose of all data in accordance with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, but we will not hold it longer than 60 days.</p>\n<p>We are aware that if you are working with EU customers, you need to be able to provide them with the ability to access, update, retrieve and remove personal data.\nWe got you! We've been set up as self service from the start and have always given you access to your data and your customers data.\nOur customer support team is here for you to answer any questions you might have about working with the API.</p>California Residents<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires us to disclose categories of Personal Information we collect and how we use it, the categories of sources from whom we collect Personal Information, and the third parties with whom we share it, which we have explained above.</p>\n<p>We are also required to communicate information about rights California residents have under California law.\nYou may exercise the following rights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u2022 Right to Know and Access.\nYou may submit a verifiable request for information regarding the:<ul>\n<li>(1) categories of Personal Information we collect, use, or share.\n</li>\n<li>(2) purposes for which categories of Personal Information are collected or used by us.\n</li>\n<li>(3) categories of sources from which we collect Personal Information.\nand </li>\n<li>(4) specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\u2022 Right to Equal Service.\nWe will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.</li>\n<li>\u2022 Right to Delete.\nYou may submit a verifiable request to close your account and we will delete Personal Information about you that we have collected.</li>\n<li>\u2022 Request that a business that sells a consumer's personal data, not sell the consumer's personal data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you.\nIf you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us.<br>We do not sell the Personal Information of our users.<br>For more information about these rights, please contact us.</p>Data deletion requests<p>To request deletion of user-generated content and/or account please write
