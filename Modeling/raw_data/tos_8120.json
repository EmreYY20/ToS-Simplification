were executed and performed in New York, New York and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (without regard to conflict of law principles).&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Should a dispute arise concerning the Website, Promotions, Content, the terms and conditions of the Agreement or the breach of same by any party hereto: (a) the parties agree to submit their dispute for resolution by arbitration before a reputable arbitration organization as mutually agreed upon by the parties in New York, New York, in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association.\nand (b) you agree to first commence a formal dispute proceeding by completing and submitting an Initial Dispute Notice to us which can be found at http://omgswweps.com/initial.html.&nbsp.\nWe may choose to provide you with a final written settlement offer after receiving your Initial Dispute Notice (\u201cFinal Settlement Offer\u201d).&nbsp;&nbsp.\nIf we provide you with a Final Settlement Offer and you do not accept it, or we cannot otherwise satisfactorily resolve your dispute, you can submit your dispute for resolution by arbitration before a reputable arbitration organization as mutually agreed upon by the parties, in your county of residence, by filing a separate Demand for Arbitration, which is also available on the Website at http://omgsweeps.com/demand.html.\nThe parties agree that the arbitrator shall not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and shall not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nFor claims of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) or less, you can choose whether the arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone or based only on submissions.\nIf the arbitrator awards you relief that is greater than our Final Settlement Offer, then we will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration and, if you retained an attorney to represent you in connection with the arbitration, we will reimburse any reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees that you incurred for investigating, preparing and pursuing the claim in arbitration.\nAny award rendered shall be final and conclusive to the parties and a judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nNothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude any party from: (a) seeking injunctive relief in order to protect its rights pending an outcome in arbitration.\nand/or (b) pursuing the matter in small claims court rather than arbitration.\nAlthough we may have a right to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses if we prevail in arbitration, we will not seek such an award from you unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>To the extent permitted by law, you agree that you will not bring, join or participate in any class action lawsuit as to any claim, dispute or controversy that you may have against Company and/or its employees, officers, directors, members, representatives and/or assigns.\nYou agree to the entry of injunctive relief to stop such a lawsuit or to remove you as a participant in the suit.\nYou agree to pay the attorney\u2019s fees and court costs that Company incurs in seeking such relief.\nThis provision preventing you from bringing, joining or participating in class action lawsuits: (i) does not constitute a waiver of any of your rights or remedies to pursue a claim individually and not as a class action in binding arbitration as provided above.\nand (ii) is an independent agreement.&nbsp.\nYou may opt-out of these dispute resolution provisions by providing written notice of your decision within thirty (30) days of the date that you first access the Website.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>MISCELLANEOUS:</p>\n<p>Should any part of this Agreement be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed consistent with applicable law and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.\nThis Agreement is personal between you and Company and governs your use of the Website, superseding any and all prior and/or contemporaneous agreements between you and Company.\nTo the extent that anything in or associated with the Website is in conflict or inconsistent with this Agreement, this Agreement shall take precedence.\nOur failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision nor of the right to enforce such provision.\nThe parties do not intend that any agency or partnership relationship be created through operation of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>CUSTOMER SERVICE:</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, please email&nbsp;info@omgsweeps.com&nbsp;or write to
