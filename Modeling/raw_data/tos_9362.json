(\"<strong>NMC</strong>\", \"<strong>we</strong>\", or \"<strong>us</strong>\") is committed to protecting your privacy and processing personal information in an open and transparent manner.\nThis Privacy Statement describes the way in which we collect and process personal information in connection with our services (referred to herein as \"<strong>personal information</strong>\").\nFor the purposes of this Privacy Statement, \"personal information\" includes information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household (\"<strong>data subject</strong>\", or \"<strong>you</strong>\").\nThis Privacy Statement also outlines your choices and legal rights in relation to your personal information.</p>\n<p>The practices described in this Privacy Statement are undertaken by Nielsen Holdings Limited providing Nielsen Marketing Cloud Services (NMC) in the United States.</p>\n<p>This Privacy Statement only applies to personal information that is processed by NMC for the provision of its services.\nAny personal information obtained by NMC from website publishers or third parties who share information with NMC.\nAs the services offered by these third parties are not owned and controlled by NMC, we encourage you to review the privacy statements of each platform, website, and mobile application (\"mobile app\") that you access or use to learn how third parties may use their data.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<strong>A.\nOur Data Services</strong>&nbsp;<p>NMC collects data from multiple sources, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>online advertiser and publisher (collectively, our \"Clients\") websites, mobile apps, and devices (including laptops and mobile devices such as smartphones);</li>\n<li>data partners (as explained in the \u2018Sources of personal information\u2019 section below).\nand</li>\n<li>when you participate in an online quiz hosted by VisualDNA, a Nielsen owned business.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This data is sorted into categories based on demographics, interests, and preferences and made available to our Clients.\nOur Clients use the data we provide to carry out tailored advertising and to provide a more relevant advertising experience to consumers.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<strong>B.\nTypes of personal information collected</strong>&nbsp;<p>We collect pseudonymous data, distinguished from the personal information described above, that does not directly identify consumers.\nThis data includes the following:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Desktop:</strong> IP address, cookie ID, hashed email address.\nbrowser type, language, access times, pages visited, and referring website addresses.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Mobile Device:</strong> IP address, Cookie ID, hashed email address, device type and model, mobile browser, operating system, carrier name and identifiers assigned to your device, such as an Apple IDFA and Google Advertising ID.</p>\n<p>We also collect the <strong>approximate geographic area (i.e.\ncountry, city, town, district)</strong> derived from your IP address or geolocation information of your mobile device if location services have been enabled.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<strong>C.\nCollection and Use of Contact Details</strong>&nbsp;<p>We may collect your name and email address to respond a request or action an opt out request.\nFor example, if you submit a request under the Your Legal Rights section or an opt-out request under the 'Your Choices' section below.\nBy submitting your details for these purposes, you are consenting to Nielsen using your information in this way.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<strong>D.\nMethods of data collection</strong>&nbsp;<p>We collect information about your computer and/or mobile device online activity via the technologies described below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Application Software Development Kits (\"SDKs\").\nAn SDK is a piece of code within a mobile app that allows us to collect device data.\nThis data includes a mobile advertising identifier (i.e., an Apple IDFA or Google Advertising ID), IP address, access time, approximate geographic area and data regarding the use of mobile apps on the device;</li>\n<li>Cookies.\nCookies are small text files that are stored on a user\u2019s browser and can be accessed by web servers when the browser returns to a website or goes to another website.\nWe use cookies to gather data about a user\u2019s visit to a website (e.g., number of visits, average time spent, pages viewed, navigation history through the website, and other statistics);</li>\n<li>Pixel tags.\nPixel tags are small strings of code that are used to generate the cookie described above.\nand</li>\n<li>Server-to-server connection.\nWe obtain data, such as an IP address, or unique device ID, that relates to users' browsers and/or mobile devices, from other online and offline third-party sources directly through connections to their servers and other secure data transfer methods.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<strong>E.\nSources of personal information collected</strong>&nbsp;<p>NMC collects the information above from the sources detailed below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Website Owners \u2013 We use our technology on websites owned by companies with advertising space to gather data about a user\u2019s visit to a website (e.g., number of visits, average time spent, pages viewed, navigation history through the website, and other statistics).</li>\n<li>Mobile App Developers/Owners - We obtain data from mobile apps which are made available to us by mobile app developers or owners.\nThis data may be automatically transmitted to us via an SDK, as outlined above, or provided to us in an offline file format.</li>\n<li>VisualDNA - We obtain data from you when you participate in an online quiz hosted by VisualDNA, which is a Nielsen owned business.</li>\n<li>Third Party Data Providers \u2013 We obtain data from companies that may not have a direct relationship with you but combine data from multiple sources (e.g.\npublishers and websites).\nThese data providers share aggregated data with their clients for purposes of data analytics that support behavioral and targeted online advertising.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<strong>F.\nHow we use personal information</strong>\n<p>In this section we outline the purposes for which we process personal information for the provision of our services to our Clients.</p>\n<p>We use data obtained from the different sources described above to <strong>build profiles</strong> for advertising purposes.\nMore specifically, we provide insights to our clients by grouping this data into various categories based on demographics, interests, and/or preferences (e.g., women in the New York region aged between 20 and 40 who are likely to be interested in fashion and certain clothing items).\nWe do this by using data about your visits to different websites to make inferences about the types of ads and content that may be of interest to you.</p>\n<p>We also process data to create segments (i.e., categories of users grouped by common traits or preferences such as lifestyle and leisure, entertainment, technology).\nThese segments enable our clients to deliver more effective, relevant and specific advertising via web browsers and mobile apps to data subjects with matching profiles.\nOur Clients identify the categories of individuals to whom they wish to target specific ads, and we provide them with device or advertising identifiers that match those categories, which they or their partners (e.g., advertising agencies) can then use to deliver ads.</p>\n<p>As required under the NAI Code, we disclose standard interest segments that are based on health related information or interests and political information or interests that we make available for our Clients.\nFor the creation of such segments, we do not process sensitive information (i.e.\ndata related to past, current or future health status).</p>\n<p>We also carry out <strong>cross device matching</strong>, which means we use data to make a deterministic or statistical match of mobile device advertising identifiers and cookie identifiers.\nFor example, we or our partners may match a user\u2019s device if the user logs in to the same online service on multiple devices or web browsers or if the user\u2019s devices share similar attributes that support an inference that they belong to the same user.\nThis allows a data subject to be associated with the same attributes across multiple devices.\nOur clients use this information to present relevant advertising across these devices.\nNeither NMC, nor our Clients have an intention to identify the data subject whose personal information is processed for this purpose.</p>\n<p>We also process personal information for our internal business purposes, as outlined below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Product Development: to develop new products and to improve our existing products and services.</li>\n<li>Corporate transactions: In the event of a contemplated or actual reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business or assets or stock, personal information may be used for the purposes of preparing and completing this transaction.</li>\n<li>Legal obligations: We may use personal information where we are required to do so by law, for instance for the purposes of assessing and responding to legal and regulatory requests (including investigations, audits, accounting and financial matters), or where we consider it necessary to enforce, exercise or defend legal rights or claims.</li>\n<li>Handling and responding to your requests: If a consumer asks us questions about their personal information or exercises any of their legal rights, we will use that consumer\u2019s personal information to assess and respond to such requests.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<strong>G.\nHow personal information is shared</strong>\n<p>We will share your personal information for different purposes, as described below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>With our Clients</strong> for the purposes referred to in this Privacy Statement.\nThe sharing of personal information with our clients is a key part of how we provide our services to them.\nFor example, we share information described in 'Types of personal information collected' with our Clients that match the categories of consumers they wish to target specific ads to.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>We share data with third parties that provide services to us</strong>, such as system hosting, management and support.\ndata backup.\nand security and storage services.\nWe exercise appropriate due diligence in the selection of third party service providers, and require that such providers maintain adequate technical and organizational security measures to safeguard personal information, and to process personal information only as instructed by us or a member of the group and for no other purposes.</li>\n<li>We share data within the Nielsen group of companies to allow Nielsen\u2019s media measurement business to provide more detailed reports for Nielsen\u2019s other customers.\nFor example, Nielsen Marketing Cloud cookie data allows Nielsen to let its advertising customers know whether consumers who clicked on an ad tend to fit into segments of inferred commercial interests, such as an interest in sports, gardening, or cars.\nThis helps Nielsen\u2019s customers refine their advertising and other marketing-related communications.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>We may share data if we have a legal obligation</strong> to do so or where we believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of our business or any person.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>In the event of a corporate transaction</strong>, such as a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock (including in connection with a bankruptcy or similar proceeding), all data collected or maintained by us may be shared with relevant third parties.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<strong>H.\nInternational transfers of personal information</strong>\n<p>Some recipients listed in the \"How personal information is shared\" section above may not be located in your home country.\nIn such cases, we ensure that the recipient is located in a country which is considered to provide an adequate level of protection for personal information.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<strong>I.\nData security</strong>\n<p>We maintain physical, technical, and organizational security measures to protect personal information against accidental, unlawful, or unauthorised destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure, or access, wherever it is processed.\nWe use generally-accepted industry security standards including physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards that are designed to help protect the data that we collect, use, and retain.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<strong>J.\nChildren's data</strong>\n<p>Our products and services are not designed for or directed at children.\nWe do not knowingly solicit, collect, or maintain personal information from children under the age of 18.\nSimilarly, we prohibit third parties from whom we receive personal information from providing us with personal information from websites and mobile apps directed at children or from knowingly sharing with us data relating to children.\nIf we become aware that we have collected or received personal information relating to a child, we will take reasonable steps to delete it.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<strong>K.\nData Retention</strong>&nbsp;<p>We ensure that your personal information will not be stored longer than is necessary to fulfil our business purposes.</p>\n<p>NMC stores cookies for a maximum duration of 120 days on websites where our cookie is present.\nHowever, we cease to use personal information collected from such a cookie 45 days after the last related device activity (e.g.\nif you do not visit the website where the cookie was placed).\nWe retain aggregated pseudonymized cookie data to support the improvement of our products and services for up to 13 months.</p>\n<p>As described in the \"Your Choices\" section below, if you withdraw your consent for personal information processing, we will no longer process data associated with those identifiers.\nHowever, new data will be processed if you visit another website where our cookie is present using a different browser.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<strong>L.\nYour choices</strong>&nbsp;<p>We are committed to providing you with choices with respect to how we process your personal information.\nThis section describes how you can exercise these choices.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Web Browsers</strong> You can opt out of our data collection for interest-based advertising purposes at any time by clicking on our opt-out page.\nPlease note that you should opt-out from every device and/or browser separately.\nAfter opting out, you will no longer be included in advertising and content targeting activities that are conducted by NMC.\nYou will still receive online ads and content, but these ads and content may not be as personalised or relevant to you.\nWe require our clients and third party partners to ensure opt out requests are communicated to us in a timely manner.</p>\n<p>NMC is a member of several interest-based advertising self-regulatory groups, including the Network Advertising Initiative (\"NAI).\nYou can also opt out of our processing of your personal information by using the opt-out tools and consumer choice mechanisms provided by the NAI here.</p>\n<p>We honor \"Do Not Track\" signals set in certain browsers by not tracking a user\u2019s web viewing data while \"Do Not Track\" is turned on in the user\u2019s browser settings.\nWe currently honor signals set in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and certain versions of Internet Explorer.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Mobile Apps</strong> Most mobile devices provide device-level opt out by activating the \"Limit Ad Tracking/App Tracking\" (for iOS devices) or \"Opt out of Ads Personalization\" (for Android devices) option in your device\u2019s settings.\nIf you use more than one mobile device, you will need to change the settings on each device.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Smart/Connected TVs</strong> You can opt out of our data collection from CTVs by visiting the NAI CTV opt-out page.\nThis explains how users can activate privacy features in many common TV and OTT environments.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<strong>M.\nYour Legal Rights</strong>\n<p>You have several rights regarding our processing of your personal information, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the right to request confirmation as to whether or not we are processing personal information concerning you, and, where that is the case, access to the personal information that we hold concerning you together with information about the nature, processing, and disclosure of your personal information;</li>\n<li>the right to request that we correct inaccurate or update incomplete personal information concerning you;</li>\n<li>the right to request that certain information about you be deleted (note that this right is not absolute)</li>\n<li>the right to have certain personal information transferred to another entity, in a structured, commonly-used, and machine-readable format (to the extent applicable).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are interested in exercising any of the rights described above, please submit a request here.</p>\n<p>If you have questions about this Privacy Statement, please contact our Data Protection Officer by emailing privacy.department@nielsen.com or via postal mail to the address provided at the beginning of this notice.\nPlease mark it for the attention of the Data Protection Officer.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<strong>N.\nChanges to Privacy Statement</strong>&nbsp;<p>We will update this Privacy Statement as required (e.g., changing business or personal information processing practices, technology, or legal requirements).\nWhen we make changes to this Privacy Statement, we will amend the \"Last updated\" date at the top of this page.\nWe encourage users to visit this page periodically to review any updates and remain informed about how we are processing and protecting personal information.</p> Additional privacy information For Nielsen Our Privacy Principles
