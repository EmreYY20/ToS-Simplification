court, and (b) to waive your and ButcherBox\u2019s respective rights to a jury trial.\nInstead, you and ButcherBox agree to arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration.\nArbitration is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions.\n</strong>To the extent permitted by applicable law, you and ButcherBox agree that any Dispute is personal to you and ButcherBox and that any Dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, you and ButcherBox agree that there will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Federal Arbitration Act.</strong> You and ButcherBox agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 15 shall be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1 et seq.\n(the

that any Dispute or small claims dispute must be commenced or filed by you or ButcherBox within one (1) year of the date the Dispute or small claims dispute arose, otherwise the underlying claim is

arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside, (b) arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and

Massachusetts and the United States, respectively, sitting in the State of Massachusetts, County of Middlesex, City of Cambridge, have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.\nYou may also litigate a small claims dispute in the small claims court located in the county of your billing address if the small claims dispute meets the requirements to be heard in that small claims court.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Authority of Arbitrator.</strong> As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS rules referenced above, the arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of the scope of this arbitration agreement and whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.\nprovided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms.\nThe arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual\u2019s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Rules of JAMS.\n</strong>The arbitration will be administered by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules (the \u201cJAMS Rules\u201d) then in effect, except as modified by this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section.\n(The JAMS Rules are

The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.\nTo the extent there are any conflicts between the JAMS Rules and these Terms, the Terms will control.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Severability.</strong> If any term, clause or provision of this Section 15 is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this Section 15 will remain valid and enforceable.\nFurther, the waivers set forth in this Section 15 are severable from the other provisions of these Terms and will remain valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by applicable law.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Opt-Out Right.</strong> You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within thirty (30) days of the date you first accepted the Terms of this Section 15 by writing to: ButcherBox OpCo, LLC Attn: General Counsel, P.O.\nBox 35730, Brighton, MA 02135.\nIn order to be effective, the opt out notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration.\nBy opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with Section 16.</li>\n</ul>16.\nGoverning Law and Venue.These Terms, your access to and use of the Services, and your Order, receipt and use of the Products shall be governed by and construed and enforced

Services and your Order, receipt and use of Products.\nThese Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without the prior written consent of ButcherBox.\nNo waiver of any provision of these Terms will constitute a waiver of such provision in any prior, concurrent or subsequent circumstance, and ButcherBox\u2019s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.\nExcept as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.<p>As Seen On</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Food and Wine Magazine</li>\n<li>New York Times</li>\n<li>Inc
