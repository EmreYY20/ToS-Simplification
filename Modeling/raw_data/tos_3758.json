applies to the information Magnite, Inc.\nand SpotX, Inc.\n(<strong>\u201cMagnite,\u201d we\u201d</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>\u201cus\u201d</strong>) collects and receives from individuals (\u201c<strong>end users</strong>\u201d or \u201c<strong>you</strong>\u201d) who interact with Digital Media Properties (defined below) that use our advertising technology platforms to deliver you ads.\nMagnite is committed to transparency, and we would like you to fully understand how we may collect, use, and share information relating to individuals (like you), and the choices that are available to you.</p>\n<p>Please note:<br>This privacy policy does not govern (i) the collection and use of information about visitors to our website, https://www.magnite.com/ information collected in the course of our sales and marketing activities&nbsp.\n\u2013 that information can be found&nbsp;here (ii) the collection and use of information from end users who interact with Digital Media Properties that use SpringServe, Inc.\u2019s technology platforms \u2013 that information can be found here or (iii) the collection, use and disclosure of information by our clients through their Digital Media Properties (defined below), which is governed by their own privacy policies and practices.\n&nbsp;For these purposes, our clients include advertisers and publishers as described below under the heading&nbsp;\u201cAbout Us.\u201d</p>\n<strong>About Us</strong>\n<p>Magnite provides digital advertising technology platforms and related services that connect buyers of advertising inventory (advertisers) with sellers of advertising inventory (publishers) (in other words, the opportunity to display a buyer\u2019s advertisement on a seller\u2019s Digital Media Property).&nbsp.\nIn this policy, we refer to our buyers and sellers collectively as \u201c<strong>clients</strong>\u201d.</p>\n<p>For example, advertisers use our technology to buy inventory to display advertising across publishers\u2019 websites and applications on Internet-connected devices and platforms, including mobile devices, computers and internet-connected TVs (which we collectively refer to as&nbsp;<strong>\u201cDigital Media Properties\u201d</strong>).</p>\n<p>When an advertiser serves an advertisement on a publisher\u2019s Digital Media Property, the advertisement will be displayed to you in connection with the content that you view.\nFor example, if you visit a video-streaming Digital Media Property and click on a video that you want to stream, then an advertisement may appear before the video is shown because the advertiser successfully purchased the opportunity to display an advertisement before that video.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information We Collect</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you visit a Digital Media Property that uses our technology, we collect certain information about you and your device (collectively, \u201c<strong>User Information</strong>\u201d).\nThis information does not enable us to directly identify you \u2013 we do not know your name or contact details \u2013 but it may be considered \u201cpersonal data\u201d or \u201cpersonal information\u201d under applicable privacy or data protection laws.</p>\n<p>In particular, we collect identifiers such as your IP addresses, cookie identifiers, and device identifiers, and may also assign identifiers to your device based upon these identifiers and other device-related information we collect as described below.\nThese identifiers help us to recognize a particular computer, mobile device, Internet-connected television or other device without knowing the identity of the user of that device.\nWe also collect information about the web page URL or app in which you are viewing content and other data that the publisher makes available to us, which helps us and our partners (such as third party advertising platforms) select appropriate advertisements to display to you.</p>\n<p>In more detail, the information we may collect includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Information about your behavior on our publishers\u2019 Digital Media Properties:</strong>&nbsp;including information about the domain, topic or name of the property, your referring website addresses, date/time of visits, viewability data, search keywords, visitor activities and actions on the publisher properties, referring/exit pages, platform type, the video title, video player size, description or category being displayed, date/time stamp, non-precise location information (including city, country, zip code), click data, types of advertisements viewed;</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Information about your browser: </strong>including information about your browser type, version, language, and history;</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Information about your device:</strong>&nbsp;including information about your IP address, device make, device model, device operating system, device operating system version, and data connection type;</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Information about your Internet service: </strong>including information about which Internet Service Provider (ISP) you use.\nand</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Deidentified data:</strong> we may process certain other deidentified data that enables us to serve you with advertisements, such as encrypted or hashed forms of your email address if our clients pass these to us.&nbsp.\nWe do not (and cannot) determine your actual identity from this deidentified data, however.\n</li>\n<li>We may also collect precise geolocation information if you have actively enabled location services on your device and a Digital Media Property passes it to us.</li>\n<li>We may also receive information from third parties at the instruction or for the benefit of our sellers that provide user demographics and information with respect to a user\u2019s preferences, patterns, click and video interactions, behaviors or interests, as well as advertisers and advertising platforms that provide information to us in order to match an ad opportunity offered by our clients with the right advertisement.</li>\n<li>Our clients may collect and store inferences about user activity using our technology.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>How We Collect User Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use cookies and other similar technologies to collect information automatically from your device when you visit with a Digital Media Property that uses our technology.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cookies help to match client\u2019s advertising opportunities with the right advertisements.\nTo do so, we may perform cookie syncing between publisher client cookies, Magnite cookies, third party data provider cookies and/or advertiser client cookies.\nThis cookie synching process allows the parties to map their respective cookie information (for example, if publisher A sets a cookie on a user\u2019s device with an ID 12345 and advertiser B sets a cookie on the same user\u2019s device with an ID 67890, cookie synching would enable publisher A and advertiser B to recognise that ID 12345 and ID 67890 relate to the same user\u2019s device).\nIn the case of advertisers, the cookie sync may influence its decision to bid on advertising opportunities, because it may recognise that the cookie ID sent to it as an opportunity to bid on relates to a user they already know (perhaps because they already targeted advertising to the user when they previously visited a Digital Media Properties in the past).</p>\n<p>We also use cookies for frequency capping, i.e., to ensure that the same user is not served the same advertisement repeatedly.\n&nbsp;Please review our Platform Cookie Statement for more information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Other technologies:</strong>&nbsp;Additionally, we use other technologies to collect User Information in order to assist with the delivery of ads, to provide reporting to our clients, and to measure end user interactions with ads and advertising effectiveness.</p>\n<p>We also work with third-party advertising platforms that separately collect and use User Information to enable our and their customers to deliver targeted advertisements using our advertising technology.\nAs an example, we work with third-party advertising companies that use information about your visits to various websites or applications across multiple devices in order to provide you with content and ads of interest across devices that they think are associated with you or your household, including web browsers, mobile apps, and internet-connected televisions.\nOur advertiser clients may use this third-party data in combination with the User Information we collect to deliver you targeted ads across multiple devices or our publisher clients may use this third-party data in combination with the User Information we collect to offer groupings of audiences, commonly known as audience segments, on the Digital Media Properties as advertising opportunities.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How We Use User Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our clients use User Information in order to inform their decisions regarding buying and selling advertising space on Digital Media Properties.\nIn particular, our clients use information we provide, in conjunction with other information they have independently collected or received from third-party advertising platforms, to deliver end users targeted advertising that our clients believe will be of particular interest to those users.\nFor more information about how targeted advertising works, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative\u2019s (<strong>\u201cNAI\u201d</strong>) educational page at&nbsp;http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work&nbsp;.</p>\n<p>We also use the User Information we collect for our legitimate business interests, some of which are \u201cbusiness purposes\u201d under California law, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To enable our clients to offer and buy advertising opportunities on Digital Media Properties;</li>\n<li>To operate and improve our technology;</li>\n<li>To compile statistics and conduct research and development for our internal business purposes;</li>\n<li>To prepare reports of visitor activity;</li>\n<li>To enable standard advertising controls;</li>\n<li>To analyze and report on ad performance (such as tracking views of ad, ad fill rates, as well as click-through rates on ads), campaign reporting, and campaign forecasting;</li>\n<li>To protect, investigate, and deter against fraudulent, unauthorized, or illegal activity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And some are \u201csales\u201d under California law, including</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to deliver end users targeted advertising.\n</li>\n<li>to create audience segments as advertising opportunities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Sharing of User

Information with our advertiser clients to help them identify and buy advertising on publishers\u2019 Digital Media Properties.\nAdvertisers may use this information in conjunction with other

Affiliates</strong>: We share User Information with other companies in the Magnite group of companies to use for any of the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Business

terms of use and protecting our network and physical assets.\nand/or</li>\n<li>to protect the safety of our employees and agents, our customers, or any person.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Vendors, and other service providers</strong>: We may share User Information with our vendors, and service providers who perform functions on our or our clients\u2019 behalf and require access to such information to provide us with services or do work for us.\nExamples include: analyzing data, reporting, fraud prevention, hosting or providing data, auditing, engaging technical support for our technology platform, and performing analysis related to our technology platform and related services.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Partners:</strong> We may share User Information with partners, including third party advertising platforms.\nThese partners use the information we provide to provide services to us and our clients, and may use the data for their own purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Information Our Clients and Vendors Collect</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our clients, our vendors, and our clients\u2019 vendors who use our technology may use their own tags, pixels, cookies, or other similar technology (or those of their other affiliates) within advertisements and on certain websites.\nWe are not responsible for our clients\u2019, vendors\u2019
