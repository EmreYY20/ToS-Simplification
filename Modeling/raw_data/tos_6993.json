&amp.\nPlugin Respondents\n<p>\n<b>POWR is used by plugin creators (people who create POWR plugins) and plugin respondents (people who respond or interact with those plugins).</b>\n</p>\nPRIVACY FOR PLUGIN CREATORS\nWhat information does POWR collect?\n<p>When you use POWR, we collect information relating to you and your use of our services from a variety of sources.\nThese are listed below.\nThe sections afterward describe what we do with this information.</p>\n<ul>\n<b>Information we collect directly from you</b>\n<li>\n<b>Registration information.</b> You need a POWR account before you can create plugins on POWR.\nWhen you register for an account, we collect your username, password and email address.\nIf you choose to register by using a third party account (such as your Google or Facebook account), please see \"Information from third parties\" below.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Billing information.</b> If you make a payment to POWR, we require you to provide your billing details, such as a name, address, email address and financial information corresponding to your selected method of payment (e.g.\na credit card number and expiration date or a bank account number).\nIf you provide a billing address, we will regard that as the location of the account holder.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Account settings.</b> You can set various preferences and personal details on pages like your account settings page.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Plugin data.</b> We store your plugin data.\nThis includes plugin settings (eg colors, fonts, backgrounds) as well as content (eg form questions in a Survey, or work history in a Resume).</li>\n<li>\n<b>Other data you intentionally share.</b> We may collect your personal information or data if you submit it to us in other contexts.\nFor example, if you submit a feature request, provide us with a testimonial, or participate in a POWR contest.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\nInformation we collect about you from other sources\n<li>\n<b>Usage data.</b> We collect usage data about you whenever you interact with our services.\nThis may include which webpages you visit, what you click on, when you performed those actions, and so on.\nAdditionally, like most websites today, our web servers keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers.\nThe log files contain data about the nature of each access, including originating IP addresses.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Device data.</b> We collect data from the device and application you use to access our services, such as your IP address and browser type.\nWe may also infer your geographic location based on your IP address.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Referral data.</b> If you arrive at a POWR website from an external source (such as a link on another website or in an email), we record information about the source that referred you to us.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Information from third parties.</b> We may collect your personal information or data from third parties if you give permission to those third parties to share your information with us.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Information from page tags.</b> We use third party tracking services that employ cookies and page tags (also known as web beacons) to collect aggregated and anonymized data about visitors to our websites.\nThis data includes usage and user statistics.</li>\n</ul>\nHow does POWR use the information we collect?\n<p>We treat your plugin data as information that is private to you.\nUnless you decide to share your plugin questions and/or responses with the public, we do not use your plugin data for our own purposes, except in the limited circumstances described in this privacy policy or unless we have your express consent.\nWe do not sell your plugin data to third parties.</p>\n<p>Generally, we use the information we collect from you in connection with providing our services to you and, on your behalf, to your plugin respondents.\nFor example, specific ways we use this information are listed below.\n(See the next section of this privacy policy to see who we share your information with.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>To provide you with our services.</b>\n<ul>\n<li>This includes providing you with customer support, which requires us to access your information to assist you (such as with plugin design and creation or technical troubleshooting).</li>\n<li>Certain features of our services use the content of your plugin data and your account information in additional ways.\nFeature descriptions will clearly identify where this is the case.\nYou can avoid the use of your plugin data in this way by simply choosing not to use such features.</li>\n<li>If you choose to link your POWR account to a third party account (such as your Google or Facebook account), we may use the information you allow us to collect from those third parties to provide you with additional features, services, and personalized content.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>To manage our services.</b> We internally use your information, including certain plugin data, for the following limited purposes:\n<ul>\n<li>To monitor and improve our services and features.\nWe internally perform statistical and other analysis on information we collect (including usage data, device data, referral data, and information from page tags) to analyze and measure user behavior and trends, to understand how people use our services, and to monitor, troubleshoot and improve our services.</li>\n<li>To assist the enforcement of our Terms of Use.</li>\n<li>To prevent potentially illegal activities.</li>\n<li>To screen for undesirable or abusive activity.\nFor example, we have automated systems that screen content for phishing activities, spam, and fraud.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>To create new services, features or content (public data and metadata only).</b> We may use public plugin data and anonymized plugin metadata (that is, data about the characteristics of a plugin but not its non-public content), to create and provide new services, features or content.\nFor example, we may look at statistics like response rates, question and answer word counts, and the average features of a plugin and publish interesting observations about these for informational or marketing purposes.\nWhen we do this, neither individual plugin creators nor plugin respondents will be identified or identifiable unless we have obtained their permission.</li>\n<li>To facilitate account creation and the logon process.\nIf you choose to link your POWR account to a third party account (such as your Google or Facebook account), we use the information you allowed us to collect from those third parties to facilitate the account creation and login process.</li>\n<li>To contact you about your service or account.\nWe occasionally send you communications of a transactional nature (e.g.\nservice-related announcements, billing-related matters, changes to our services or policies, a welcome email when you first register).\nYou can't opt out of these communications since they are required to provide our services to you.</li>\n<li>To contact you for marketing purposes (if you opt in).\nWe will only do this if you have given us your express permission to contact you for this purpose.\nFor example, during the account registration process we will ask for your permission to use your information to contact you for promotional purposes.\nYou may opt out of these communications at any time by clicking on the \"unsubscribe\" link in them, or changing the relevant setting on your My Account page.</li>\n<li>To respond to legal requests and prevent harm.\nIf we receive a subpoena or other legal request, we may need to inspect the data we hold to determine how to respond.</li>\n</ul>\nWith whom do we share or disclose your information?\n<p>\n<b>We don't sell your plugin data!</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>When might we disclose your plugin data to third parties?</b> Only for a limited number of reasons.\nMostly commonly, we share your information with our service providers who help us to provide our services to you.\nWe contractually bind these service providers to keep your information confidential and to use it only for the purpose of providing their services to us.\nFor example, we use payment processors who help us to process credit card transactions.\nBy using our services, you authorize POWR to sub-contract in this manner on your behalf.</p>\n<p>Rare circumstances include when we need to share information if required by law, or in a corporate restructuring or acquisition context (see below for more details).</p>\n<p>We recognize that you have entrusted us with safeguarding the privacy of your information.\nBecause that trust is very important to us, the only time we will disclose or share your personal information or plugin data with a third party is when we have done one of three things, in accordance with applicable law: (a) given you notice, such as in this privacy policy.\n(b) obtained your express consent, such as through an opt-in checkbox.\nor (c) anonymized the information so that individuals cannot be identified by it.\nWhere required by law, we will obtain your express consent prior to disclosing or sharing any personal information.</p>\n<p>We may disclose:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Your information to our service providers.</b> We use service providers who help us to provide you with our services.\nWe give relevant persons working for some of these providers access to your information, but only to the extent necessary for them to perform their services for us.\nWe also implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and data is maintained, used only for the provision of their services to us, and handled in accordance with this privacy policy.\nExamples of service providers include payment processors, email service providers, and web traffic analytics tools.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Your account details to your billing contact.</b> If your details (as the account holder) are different to the billing contact listed for your account, we may disclose your identity and account details to the billing contact upon their request (we also will usually attempt to notify you of such requests).\nBy using our services and agreeing to this privacy policy, you consent to this disclosure.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Aggregated information to third parties to improve or promote our services.</b> No individuals can be identified or linked to any part of the information we share with third parties to improve or promote our services.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>The presence of a cookie to advertise our services.</b> We may ask advertisers to display ads promoting our services on other websites.\nWe may ask them to deliver those ads based on the presence of a cookie but in doing so will not share any other information with the advertiser.\nOur advertising network partners may use cookies and page tags or web beacons to collect certain non-personal information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you with targeted advertising based upon your interests.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Your information if required or permitted by law.</b> We may disclose your information as required or permitted by law, or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, subpoena, or other legal process served on us.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Your information if there's a change in business ownership or structure.</b> If ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, or we undertake a corporate reorganization (including a merger or consolidation) or any other action or transfer between POWR entities, you expressly consent to POWR transferring your information to the new owner or successor entity so that we can continue providing our services.\nIf required, POWR will notify the applicable data protection agency in each jurisdiction of such a transfer in accordance with the notification procedures under applicable data protection laws.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Information you expressly consent to be shared.</b> For example, we may expressly request your permission to provide your contact details to third parties for various purposes, including to allow those third parties to contact you for marketing purposes.\n(You may later revoke your permission, but if you wish to stop receiving communications from a third party to which we provided your information with your permission, you will need to contact that third party directly.)\n</li>\n</ul>\nWhat are your rights to your information?\n<p>You can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Update your account details.</b> You can update your registration and other account information on your My Account page.\nInformation is updated immediately.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Download/backup your plugin data.</b> We provide the ability to export, share and publish some plugin data in a variety of formats.\nThis allows you to create your own backups or conduct offline data analysis.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Delete your plugin data.</b> Deleting plugin data in the ways described on this page may not permanently delete plugin data immediately.\nAs long as you maintain an account with us, we may retain your deleted data in case you delete something by accident and need to restore it.\nTo the extent permitted by law, we will permanently delete your data if you request to cancel your account.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Cancel your account.</b> To cancel and delete your account, please contact customer support.\nDeleting your account will cause all the plugin data in the account to be permanently deleted, as permitted by law, and will disable your access to any other services that require a POWR account.\nWe will respond to any such request, and any appropriate request to access, correct, update or delete your personal information within the time period specified by law (if applicable) or without excessive delay.\nWe will promptly fulfill requests to delete personal data unless the request is not technically feasible or such data is required to be retained by law (in which case we will block access to such data, if required by law).\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>For how long do we retain your data?</b> We generally retain your data for as long as you have an account with us, or to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.\nData that is deleted from our servers may remain as residual copies on offsite backup media for up to approximately 12 months afterward.</p>\nSecurity, cookies and other important information\n<p>\n<b>Changes to this privacy policy.</b> We may modify this privacy policy at any time, but if we do so, we will notify you by publishing the changes on this website.\nIf we determine the changes are material, we will provide you with additional, prominent notice as is appropriate under the circumstances, such as via email.</p>\n<p>For any changes to this privacy policy for which you are required to provide prior consent, we will provide you with reasonable notice of such changes before they become effective and provide you with the opportunity to consent to those changes.\nIf you do not cancel your subscription and continue to use our services beyond the advance-notice period, you will be considered as having expressly consented to the changes in our privacy policy.\nIf you disagree with the terms of this privacy policy or any updated privacy policy, you may close your account at any time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Security.</b> We are committed to handling your personal information and data with integrity and care.\nHowever, regardless of the security protections and precautions we undertake, there is always a risk that your personal data may be viewed and used by unauthorized third parties as a result of collecting and transmitting your data through the internet.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Cookies.</b> We use cookies on our websites.\nCookies are small bits of data we store on the device you use to access our services so we can recognize repeat

we may not be able to fulfill your request and we will let you know why.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Online Tracking.</b> We currently do not process or comply with any web browser's \"do not track\" signal or other similar mechanism that indicates a request to disable online tracking of individual users who visit our websites or use our services (unless otherwise stated in a service-specific privacy statement).</li>\n<li>\n<b>Safety of Minors and COPPA.</b> Our services are not intended for and may not be used by minors.\n\"Minors\" are individuals under the age of majority in their place of

addresses of visitors to our websites (whether or not the visitor has a POWR account) and store the IP addresses in log files.\nWe use these log files for purposes such as system administration and maintenance, record keeping, tracking referring web sites, inferring your location, and security purposes (e.g.\ncontrolling abuse, spam and DDOS attacks).\nWe also store IP addresses along with certain actions you take on our system.\nIP addresses are only linked to plugin responses if a plugin creator has configured a plugin to collect IP addresses.\nBy agreeing to this privacy policy, you expressly consent to POWR using your IP address for the foregoing purposes.\nIf you wish to opt out from the foregoing consent to use your IP address, you must cancel your account (if you have one) or not respond to a plugin if requested to do so.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Data controller.</b> POWR Inc., is the data controller for registration, billing and other account information that we collect from users

certain exceptions.\nOnce we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.\nWe may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.</li>\n<li>Detect security

(\u201c<b>Additional Terms</b>\u201d).\nThose Additional Terms become a part of your agreement with us if you use those Services.\nWe refer to the combination of this TOU and any applicable Additional Terms collectively as these \u201c<b>Terms</b>\u201d.\nYou indicate your agreement to these Terms by clicking or tapping on a button indicating your acceptance of these Terms, by executing a document that references them, or by using the Services.\nIf you will be using the Services on behalf of an organization, you agree to these Terms on behalf of that organization and you represent that you have the authority to do so.\nIn such case, \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d will refer to that organization.\nCertain country-specific term may apply to you if you are located outside the United

pricing and payment terms presented to you for that Service.\nWhere applicable, you will be billed using the billing method you select through your account management page.\nFees paid by you are non-refundable, except as provided in these Terms or when required by law.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.2.\nSubscriptions.</b> Some of our Services are billed on a subscription basis (we call these \u201cSubscriptions\u201d).\nThis means that you will be billed in advance on a recurring, periodic basis (each period is called a \u201cbilling cycle\u201d).\nBilling cycles are typically monthly or annual, depending on what subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.\nYour Subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless you cancel auto-renewal through your online account management page, or by contacting our customer support team.\nWhile we will be sad to see you go, you may cancel auto-renewal on your Subscription at any time, in which case your Subscription will continue until the end of that billing cycle before terminating.\nYou may cancel auto-renewal on your Subscription immediately after the Subscription starts if you do not want it to renew.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.3.\nTaxes.</b> Unless otherwise stated, you are responsible for any taxes (other than POWR\u2019s income tax) or duties associated with the sale of the Services, including any related penalties or interest (collectively, \u201cTaxes\u201d).\nYou will pay POWR for the Services without any reduction for Taxes.\nIf POWR is obliged to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to you, unless you provide POWR with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority or other documentation providing evidence that no tax should be charged.\nIf you are required by law to withhold any Taxes from your payments to POWR, you must provide POWR with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to support such payments.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.4.\nPrice Changes</b>.\nPOWR may change the fees charged for the Services at any time, provided that, for Services billed on a subscription basis, the change will become

your Subscription before the change becomes effective.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.5.\nOverage Fees</b>.\nUnless otherwise stated, any overage fees incurred by you will be billed in arrears on a monthly basis.\nOverage fees which remain unpaid for 30 days after being billed are considered overdue.\nFailure to pay overage fees when due may result in the applicable Service being limited, suspended, or terminated (subject to applicable legal requirements), which may result in a loss of your data associated with that Service.</p>2.\nPrivacy<br>\n<p>\n<b>2.1.\nPrivacy</b>.\nIn the course of using the

share your Content in accordance with our privacy policies.</p>\n<p>Both POWR and Plugin Creators process Plugin Respondents\u2019 personal information (for example, name, email address, and address) and are therefore considered separate and independent data controllers of buyers\u2019 personal information under EU law.\nThat means that each party is responsible for the personal information it processes in providing the Services.\nFor example, if a Plugin Creator accidentally discloses a Plugin Respondent\u2019s name and email address when fulfilling another Plugin Respondent\u2019s order, the Plugin Creator, not POWR, will be responsible for that unauthorized disclosure.</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.2.\nConfidentiality</b>.\nPOWR will treat your Content as confidential information and only use and

relation to certain Services such that POWR no longer has access to it.\nThis license also extends to any trusted third parties we work with to the extent necessary to provide the Services to you.\nIf you provide POWR with feedback about the Services, we may use your feedback without any obligation to you.</p>\n<p>\n<b>3.3.\nCopyright Claims (DMCA Notices).</b> POWR Inc.\nresponds to notices of
