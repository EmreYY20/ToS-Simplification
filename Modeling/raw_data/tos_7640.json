with your Card Account, then you agree to waive the limitations on your liability for unauthorized use of the Cards under the Truth in Lending Act.<br>\nIf you add your Card to a digital wallet, you are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your digital wallet credentials.\nBy sharing your Card Data with any other person, you are expressly authorizing them to access your Card Data and your Account, and initiate Transactions on your Card using the digital wallet service.\nWe are not the provider of the digital wallet, and we are not responsible for providing the digital wallet

annual membership fees, Card replacement fees, service fees, cash advance fees, chargeback or fees, late payment fees, and other fees that we will disclose to you in your Account (\u201cFees\u201d).\nIf you make a purchase in a currency other than United States dollars (\u201cUSD\u201d), the amount of the Transaction will be converted into USD, and you may have a foreign exchange fee for the conversion.\nThe exchange rate between the Transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by the Payment Network from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which may vary from the rate the Payment Network itself receives, or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date.\nThere are no additional fees for foreign Transactions.\nD.\nReceipts.\nAccount Statements.\nDisputed Transactions.\nThe Payment Network requires merchants to provide a record of your authorization for each Transaction using your Card, including copies of any contracts signed by you or invoices issued to you by the merchant (collectively, \u201cReceipts\u201d).\nYou should obtain a Receipt at the time you make a Transaction using your Card to verify your Transactions.\nYou can view a record of all Transactions and fees (\u201cAccount Statement\u201d) by accessing your Account, but you should be aware that the records in your Account Statement are not the equivalent of a Receipt.\nWe will not send you a periodic Account Statement by mail, but you can download it from your Account at any time.\nYou should review your Account Statement regularly and compare it with your Receipts as evidence for reporting Transactions that are erroneous or unauthorized.\nIf you and a merchant have a dispute regarding a Transaction identified on your Account Statement (a \u201cDisputed Transaction\u201d), such as delivery of incorrect goods or services or being charged the wrong amount, you should first attempt to resolve the dispute with the merchant.\nIf the dispute is not resolved to your satisfaction or if you believe the Transaction is unauthorized, you may initiate a chargeback through your Account.\nYou must report any Disputed Transaction no more than 60 days after the Disputed Transaction is posted to your Account Statement.\nThe Payment Network does not accept, and we will not process any Disputed Transactions reported more than 60 days after the Disputed Transaction or error posted to your Card Account.\nNotices for Disputed Transactions must specify the Company, User, details about the Transaction, Receipts, and an explanation of your belief that the Disputed Transaction was made in error or was unauthorized.\nThe information you submit will be reviewed in a commercially reasonable manner.\nYour Card Account is commercial in nature and, thus, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E do not apply to Disputed Transactions.\nBy accepting this agreement, you assign and transfer to us or our agents any rights and claims, excluding tort claims, that you may have against a merchant for any Disputed Transaction fully or partially credited to your Card Account.\nE.\nSpending Limits.\nWe or Mercury may impose Spending Limits on individual Transactions, and on daily, weekly or monthly Transaction amounts on your Card with or without notice to you.\nYour Spending Limits are subject to periodic review and may change based on your Card Account history, Transaction activity, information from your Deposit Accounts, Company\u2019s business type, and other factors.\nFor security reasons, we, Mercury or your Administrator may also limit the amount or number of such Transactions you may make.\nWe may not disclose your Spending Limits but may explain whether specific Transactions or monthly volumes may exceed any Spending Limits upon request.\nSpending Limits are dynamic and may be modified at any time with or without notice to you, including temporarily increases or decreases or reducing Spending Limits to $0.\nWe may attempt notify you before or soon after a potential Spending Limit decrease for your Cards, but we may not always be able to do so.\nF.\nAuthorization Holds.\nWhen you use your Card to purchase goods or services from certain merchants, such as a hotel or a car rental agency, the merchant may request authorization from us in advance.\nIn the event of such a request, we may place a hold on your Card Account for up to 7 days for the amount of the request, which may reduce your Spending Limit during the hold period.\nIn some cases, a merchant may request pre-authorization for a Transaction, which may be subject to a hold on your Spending Limit for up to 30 days.\nMerchants may decide to increment the pre-authorized amount if the amount is insufficient for the final purchase, or, they may request to extend the same authorization amount if the final purchase date will be in the future.\nThese events may result in a hold on your Spending Limit for up to another 30 days from the adjustment date.\nWe will not be responsible for any Transactions not completed because of a hold.\nIf the preauthorization request varies from the amount of the actual Transaction, we will reduce your Spending Limit by the amount of the preauthorization request.\nG.\nPayments.\nYou are responsible for payment in full of all Transactions and Fees identified on your Account Statement at the end of each billing cycle (\u201cBilling Cycle\u201d).\nDepending on the information we receive from you when you apply for a Card Account, your Billing Cycle may be weekly, monthly, semi-monthly, or another billing period at our sole discretion.\nWe will specify your Billing Cycle and the Account Statement due date (\u201cPayment Date\u201d) in your Account.\nAt the end of each Billing Cycle, Mercury will automatically debit the Deposit Account you indicated in your Account in the amount of the Account Statement balance.\nYou may associate more than one Deposit Account to pay your Account Statement balance.\nIf available as an option, you may also provide us an external bank account through your Account (a \u201cLinked Account\u201d, and together with the Deposit Accounts, the \u201cFunding Accounts\u201d) to pay all or a portion of your Account Statement balance.\nIf there are insufficient funds in your preferred Deposit Account to pay the full amount due on your Account Statement, you authorize us to automatically debit the unpaid remaining balance from first, your secondary Deposit Account (if any) and second, your Linked Account.\nIf the Billing Cycle ends on a day that falls on a weekend or a U.S.\nfederal holiday, we may debit your Funding Accounts the last business day prior to the end of the Billing Cycle.\nIf the automatic debit from your Funding Accounts fails for any reason, we will attempt to debit your Funding Account again.\nYou may also make payments at any time by logging in to your Account.\nYou may not make payments via check or wire transfer.\nH.\nAuthorization to Debit Funding Accounts.\nACH Authorization.\nTHIS SECTION PROVIDES AUTHORIZATION TO AUTOMATICALLY DEBIT YOUR DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS AND LINKED ACCOUNTS, INCLUDING LINKED ACCOUNTS NO LONGER CONNECTED TO YOUR CARD ACCOUNT,

by debiting funds from your Funding Accounts (including Funding Accounts no longer connected to your Account).\nIf we, Mercury or our respective assigns use the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) network

to debit your Deposit Accounts or Linked Accounts for verification purposes (through microdeposits or similar means).\nWe may initiate debits you have authorized in our name or in the names of our successors or assigns.\nYou also authorize us to debit your Funding Accounts immediately for the amount of your Account Statement balance and any other amounts you owe us before the due date or at any other time during the Billing Cycle and without additional notice if: (a) the total aggregate balance of your Funding Accounts connected to your Card Account is less than the balance minimums required by our underwriting criteria.\n(b) you do not satisfy one or more of our other underwriting or credit requirements.\n(c) you or the amounts you owe us pose or may pose an unacceptable risk to us, Mercury, our service providers, or our or their respective successors or assigns.\n(d) you are unlikely to be able to pay your Account Statement balance at the end of the Billing Cycle because you (i) do or we believe you may cease to exist, (ii) take any action to dissolve or wind up your affairs, or (iii) engage in voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy filings, or such case is filed by or against you, or a receiver or trustee for the benefit of creditors is appointed for you.\n(e) you have breached the terms of this agreement.\n(f) you are in default of any other agreement with us, Mercury or any of our or Mercury\u2019s service providers.\nor (g) you or we close your Account.\nIn the event there is an error in processing an electronic debit, you authorize us to correct the error by initiating an electronic credit or debit to the relevant Funding Account in the amount of such error on or after the date such error occurs.\nTo withdraw your debit authorization from a Funding Account under this Section H, you must provide us 30 days\u2019 notice.\nIf you withdraw the debit authorization from all Funding Accounts, you must pay all Transactions, Fees, and other amounts not yet reflected on your Account Statement balance immediately, and you authorize us to debit your Funding Accounts for such amounts before the withdrawal of authorization takes effect.\nWithdrawal of a debit authorization does not terminate the Mercury Terms of Use, or your obligation to pay all amounts owed under this agreement.\nI.\nFailure to Pay.\nCollections.\nSet-Off.\nSecurity Interest.\nAny failure to pay the full amount you owe us when required is a breach of the Mercury Terms of Use and this agreement.\nIf you fail to pay the full Account Statement balance amount on time from your Deposit Accounts, we may attempt to collect the unpaid balance from your Linked Account, whether or not your Linked Account is currently connected to your Card Account.\nWe may collect partial payments for unpaid amounts from any Funding Account, but any partial payment is not a waiver of our rights and will not satisfy your obligation to pay us in full.\nIf we cannot collect the amounts via Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) network or another method, you agree to immediately pay all amounts you owe as directed by us.\nYou are responsible for legal fees, collections fees and all related costs or expenses that we or Mercury incur in the process of collecting overdue payments, and you are responsible for paying interest on such amounts at up to the maximum rate permitted under law, to the extent we decide to charge such interest.\nFor the purposes of collections of amounts owed, Mercury is a third-party beneficiary authorized to pursue collections of all amounts you may owe under this agreement.\nWe may set off, debit, or collect any amounts you owe from amounts in any Deposit Account that you hold jointly with a third party or open in the future with one of Mercury\u2019s Deposit Account Banking Providers, even if you have closed your Deposit Account or we have closed your Card Account.\nWe may exercise this right against you or any of your respective successors or assigns, or any assignees for the benefit of your creditors, trustees, or receivers of Company assets.\nThis right will exist even if we do not exercise it prior to the making, filing, or issuance of an arbitration demand, court order, or other action.\nJ.\nSecurity Interest.\nSubject to any limitations imposed by applicable federal or state law and in addition to other remedies available to us, to secure the amounts you owe us you hereby grant us a security interest in all amounts and property of yours now or hereafter in possession of or on deposit in your Funding Accounts, whether held in general or special account or deposit or for safekeeping or otherwise.\nWe may exercise every such security interest and right of setoff without demand without notice to you.\nNo security interest or right of setoff will be deemed to have been waived by any act or conduct on our part, or any failure to enforce such security interest or to exercise such right of setoff, or by any delay in doing so.\nEvery security interest and right of setoff will continue in full force and effect until we specifically waive or release such security interest or right of setoff by an instrument in writing executed by us.\nK.\nClosing or Suspending Your Account.\nWe may refuse to authorize any Transaction or may close or suspend your Card Account or any Card at any time if we believe, in our sole discretion, that you or your Card Account present an unacceptable level of financial, reputational or regulatory risk.\nWe may condition the reactivation of your Card Account or Cards upon payment of amounts owed.\nWe may require you to provide financial and other information we deem necessary, including any information we need to comply with legal or regulatory requirements and our internal policies and procedures.\nIf we do, you agree to provide the information to us.\nYou may close your Card Account by contacting us or emailing us at help@mercury.com.\nYou must pay all amounts owed

this agreement is limited to $100.00, not including any amounts we owe you under Section 2D.\nThis limitation applies regardless of the legal theory on which your claim is based.\nC.\nIndemnification.\nYou agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless us, Mercury and our service providers, and their respective subsidiaries, agents, licensors, managers, and other affiliated companies, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, and our third-party service providers, from and against any and all claims brought against us by any third party

party\u2019s access and use of the Card authorized by you.\nD.\nGoverning Law.\nYou Card Account is held in, and this agreement is entered into and is governed by the internal laws, and not by the laws regarding conflicts of laws, of the State of Connecticut.\nEach Party hereby submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of such state, and waives any objection to venue with respect to actions brought in such courts.\nHowever, when federal law applies, federal law will be used instead of laws of Connecticut.\nIf any part of the agreement is unenforceable, this will not make any other part unenforceable.\nE.\nSeverability.\nIn the event that any part of this agreement is deemed by a court, regulatory authority, or other public or private tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be deemed to have been omitted from this agreement.\nThe remainder of this agreement will remain in full force and effect, and will be modified to any extent
