legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal requirements.<br>8.\nData protection provisions about the application and use of Google Analytics (with anonymization function)<br>On this website, the Controller has integrated the component of Google Analytics (incl.\nthe anonymization function).\nGoogle Analytics is a web analytics service.\nWeb analytics is the collection, gathering, and analysis of data about the behaviour of visitors to websites.\nA web analysis service collects, inter alia, data about the website from which a person has come (the so-called referrer), which sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what duration a sub-page was viewed.\nWeb analytics are mainly used for the optimization of a website and in order to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.<br>The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, United States.<br>For the web analytics through Google Analytics, the Controller uses the application \u201c_gat.\n_anonymizeIp\u201d.\nBy means of this application the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject is shortened and anonymised by Google when accessing our websites from a Member State of the European Union or another Contracting State to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.<br>The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyse the traffic on our website.\nGoogle uses the collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our websites, and to provide other services concerning the use of our Internet site for us.<br>Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.\nThe definition of cookies is explained above.\nWith the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to analyse the use of our website.\nWith each call to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the Controller and into which a Google Analytics component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will automatically submit data through the Google Analytics component for online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Google.\nDuring the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Google gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks, and subsequently create commission settlements.<br>The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which the access was made, and the frequency of visits of our website by the data subject.\nWith each visit to our Internet site, such personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, will be transmitted to Google in the United States of America.\nThese personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America.\nGoogle may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.<br>The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.\nSuch an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.\nIn addition, cookies already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.<br>Furthermore, the data subject has the option of objecting to and preventing the collection of the data generated by Google Analytics for the use of this website and the processing of this data by Google.\nTo do this, the data subject must download and install a browser add-on at the link below.\nThis browser add-on informs Google Analytics via JavaScript that no data and information about website visits may be transmitted to Google Analytics.\nThe installation of the browser add-on is considered by Google as a formal contradiction.\nIf the data subject\u2019s information technology system is later deleted, formatted or reinstalled, the data subject must re-install the browser add-on to disable Google Analytics.\nIf the browser add-on is uninstalled or disabled by the data subject or any other person within their control, you may reinstall or re-enable the browser add-on.\nYou can download this browser add-on here.<br>Opt-out cookies prevent the future collection of your data when you visit this website.\nTo prevent Universal Analytics tracking across devices, you must opt-out on all systems you use.\nYou activate the opt out cookie here: Opt Out Google Analytics.<br>The use of Google Analytics is based on our legitimate interest in an appropriate design, the statistical evaluation and the efficient application of our website and the fact that your legitimate interests do not predominate, Art.\n6 (1) lit.\nf GDPR.<br>Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en and under https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/.\nGoogle Analytics is further explained under the following link: https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/.<br>9.\nData protection provisions about the application and use of Google-AdWords<br>advanced store GmbH may from time to time integrate Google AdWords on this website.\nGoogle AdWords is an Internet advertising service that allows advertisers to run both Google and Google Network search engine results.\nGoogle AdWords allows an advertiser to pre-set keywords that will display an ad on Google\u2019s search engine results only when the search engine retrieves a keyword-related search result.\nIn the Google Network, ads are distributed on topical web pages using an automated algorithm and according to predefined keywords.<br>The operating company of Google AdWords is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, UNITED STATES.<br>The purpose of Google AdWords is the promotion of our website by the inclusion of relevant advertising on the websites of third parties and in the search engine results of the search engine Google and an insertion of third-party advertising on our website.<br>If a data subject reaches our website via a Google ad, a conversion cookie is filed on the information technology system of the data subject through Google.\nThe definition of cookies is explained above.\nA conversion cookie loses its validity after 30 days and is not used to identify the data subject.\nIf the cookie has not expired, the conversion cookie is used to check whether certain sub-pages, e.g., the shopping cart from an online shop system, were called on our website.\nThrough the conversion cookie, both Google and the Controller, can understand whether a person who reached an AdWords ad on our website generated sales, i.e.\nwhether the person executed or cancelled a sale of goods.<br>The data and information collected through the use of the conversion cookie is used by Google to create visit statistics for our website.\nThese visit statistics are used in order to determine the total number of users who have been served through AdWords ads to ascertain the success or failure of each AdWords ad and to optimize our AdWords ads in the future.\nNeither our company nor other Google AdWords advertisers receive information from Google that could identify the data subject.<br>The conversion cookie stores personal information, e.g.\nthe Internet pages visited by the data subject.\nEach time visiting our Internet pages, personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, is transmitted to Google in the United States of America.\nThese personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America.\nGoogle may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.<br>The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as stated above, by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.\nSuch a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from placing a conversion cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.\nIn addition, a cookie set by Google AdWords may be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.<br>The data subject has a possibility of objecting to the interest-based advertisement of Google.\nTherefore, the data subject must access from each of the browsers in use the link https://adssettings.google.de/authenticated and set the personally desired settings.<br>The use of Google AdWords is based on our legitimate interest in an appropriate design, the statistical evaluation and the efficient application of our website and the fact that your legitimate interests do not predominate, Art.\n6 (1) lit.\nf GDPR.<br>Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.<br>10.\nGoogle Hosted Libraries<br>We include the Hosted Libraries of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.<br>Hosted Libraries is a service provided by Google Inc.\n(USA).\nThe application of the hosted libraries is made by a server call to Google in the US, assuming that requests are stored by Google.\nIf your browser does not support this feature, the hosted libraries will not be retrieved, which can have a significant impact on the functionality of the web page.<br>https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/<br>\u200dPrivacy policy: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/<br>11.\nPeriod for which the personal data will be stored<br>The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period.\nAfter expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.<br>12.\nProvision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement.\nRequirement necessary to enter into a contract.\nObligation of the data subject to provide the personal data.\npossible consequences of failure to provide such data<br>We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g.\ntax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g.\ninformation on the contractual partner).\nSometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us.\nThe data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her.\nThe non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded.\nBefore personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee.\nThe employee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.<br>13.\nRights of the data subject<br>A.\nRight of confirmation<br>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the Controller the confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are

objected to processing pursuant to Art.\n21 (1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the Controller override those of the data subject.</li>\n</ul>If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing of personal data stored by the advanced store GmbH, he/she may at any time contact any employee of the Controller.\nThe employee of the advanced store GmbH will arrange the restriction of the processing.<br>F.\nRight of data portability<br>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the

processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing.\nThis applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.\nIf the data subject objects to the advanced
