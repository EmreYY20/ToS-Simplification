outside of the EEA unless the transfer meets certain criteria.</p>\n<p>Many of our third parties service providers are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>\n<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we do our best to ensure a similar degree of security of data by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for

approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.\nor</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Where we use providers based in the United States, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If none of the above safeguards is available, we may request your explicit consent to the specific transfer.\nYou will have the right to withdraw this consent at any time.</p>\n<p>Please email us at
