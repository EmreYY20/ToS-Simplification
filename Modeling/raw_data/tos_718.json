reasons why such data are been requested and how they will be used.</p>\n<p>In this regard, this document aims to provide you, in a simple and intuitive way, with all useful and appropriate information so that you can be consciously informed of the use and processing of your Personal Data carried out by Cookies as later defined and used by this Website.</p>\n<p>The extended information about the use of Cookies and other similar technologies (so-called <strong>Cookie Policy</strong>) has been, then, drawn up according to the principle of transparency and to all elements requested by article 13 of the Regulation and has been divided into single sections (hereinafter \u201c<strong>Sections</strong>\u201d and singularly \u201c<strong>Section</strong>\u201d), each of which deals with a specific topic to make your reading more simple and easy to understand.\n</p> B.\nWhat are Cookies? <p>Cookies are text strings made up of chunks of code sent by a web server (for example, a site) to an Internet browser and installed on it.\nIn particular, they are small text files that the websites visited by users send to their terminals, where they are stored and then sent back to the same sites on the occasion of a subsequent visit.\nAlmost all browsers are set up to allow the automatic storage of Cookies on the User terminal.</p>\n<p>Cookies are used for various purposes, they have different peculiarities and can be used both by the Processing Owner, by the Processing Co-owners, as identified and defined in the following, as well as by third parties who use or can use on the Website, even in combination between them, the following cookies categories, divided in accordance with the classification proposed in Opinion 04/2012 relative to exemption from consent for the use of cookies published by the Working Party article 29 within the EU (available here):</p> Session or permanent Cookies <p>Cookies can expire at the end of the browser session (the period of time between the user opening of a browser window and its closing) or can be stored for a longer period.\nSession Cookies are those who allow websites to link the user actions during a browser session.\nSession Cookies expire when the browser session ends.\nPermanent Cookies are stored on the user device between browser sessions, for variable periods of time, and facilitate the storage of Users preferences or actions in relation to a website.</p> Technical or profiling Cookies <p>Technical Cookies are those used by the Owner of a website for the sole purpose of transmitting a message via a electronic communication network, or as is strictly necessary for a service provider of the information society to provide the service the subscriber or user has explicitly requested.\nFor the installation of this Cookies the prior consent of the Users is not required, wherever used directly by the site manager.\nProfiling Cookies are designed to create user-related profiles and are used to send advertising messages in line with the preferences expressed by the User while navigating.\nGiven the considerable invasive nature that this Cookies can have in regard to the Users privacy, the European and Italian Legislation foresees that the User should be adequately informed on their use through a short policy (banner) and a extended one on the site, and that he must express his consent the first time he visits the site.\nSuch consent can be expressed in general, by interacting with the short policy banner on the landing page of the site, in the manner indicated on that banner, or it can be provided or denied in a selective manner, following the procedures described below.\nThis consent shall be tracked on the occasion of subsequent visits.\nHowever, the User has always the option to withdraw all or part of the consent already expressed.</p> First or third party Cookies <p>A Cookie is \u201cof first party\u201d (so-called first party cookie) or \u201cof third party\u201d (third party cookie) depending on the website or the domain it comes from.<br> First party Cookies are, basically, those set and/or managed by the site owner.\nFor these Cookies the obligation to provide information, obtain the consent and/or allow the possible blocking of Cookies shall rest with the owner of the site.\nThird party Cookies are those set by a domain other than the one being visited by the User.\nFor these Cookies, the obligation to provide information and to describe the method for consenting or blocking Cookies lies with the third party, while the owner of the site is only obliged to insert on his site a link to the third party site where those elements are available.</p> C.\nOther technologies similar to Cookies used in mobile apps <p>The Processing Owner, Co-owners and third parties can use, especially for mobile apps, technologies similar to Cookies and aimed at information storage and recovery relative to your device and his use.\nThose activities can be carried out using:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pixel Tag or Web Beacon</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A Pixel Tag (known as \u201cweb beacon\u201d or \u201ctracking pixel\u201d) is a smaller transparent graphic file (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is embedded in a web page, in combination with a Cookie, or within a mobile app and allows the collection of information related to the use of the web page and/or mobile app which contains the tracking pixel.\nThe pixel tags can be used for different purposes, such as, including but not limited to, analyzing the use of websites and/or mobile apps, controlling and reporting on advertisement, and personalizing ads and contents.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mobile device identifiers and SDK</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A SDK mobile is a pixel tag or web beacon version (aforementioned) only for mobile applications.\nA SDK is a chunk of code that developers can include in mobile apps to allow displaying ads, collecting data and implementing related services.\nThis technology is used to provide you, through mobile apps and browsers, with specific ads and features based on insights associated to your device or tablet.</p>\n<p>Some of the services listed below in accordance with the feature offered to the Users, focused on the use of third party SDK, could require no User consent.\nBesides, those third parties could \u2013 in addition to what is specified in this Cookie Policy and also unbeknownst to the Processing Owner and/or the Co-owners \u2013 make further tracking activities on the User.\nFor detailed information on the matter, please consult the respective privacy policies of
