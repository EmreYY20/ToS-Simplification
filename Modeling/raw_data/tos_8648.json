does not acquire or collect any personal information about you.\nYour name, address and phone number all remain your private property.\nOfferToro does, however, collect information that is specific to how you use the Internet.\nThis non-personally identifying information can include and is not limited to, the advertisements you engaged with, the server you are logged onto, User Agent, mobile device ID, the geographic location of the ISP you use and your IP address.\nThis information is obtained solely for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring a given ad's effectiveness on behalf of

information on sites you've visited and activities performed to your computer browser.\nWe do this to understand the way a user responds to the ads we deliver.\nFor example, this information lets us

member sites.\nWe may, however, obtain non-personally identifiable information about you and combine it with data that we have collected to better target ads that match your interests.\nMost web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that use if you desire.</p>\n<p>Although we believe that cookies help enhance your experience on the Web (by not repeatedly serving the same ads to you and delivering more relevant messages to you), neither OfferToro nor its third party ad serving party needs cookies to deliver ads to you.\nIf you do not want the benefits of cookies, there is a simple procedure that allows you to deny or accept this feature.\nIn order to \"opt out\" of the benefits of cookies, you may manually delete your cookies by
