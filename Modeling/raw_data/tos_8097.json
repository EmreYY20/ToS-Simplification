Policy</li>\n<li>Terms of Sale</li>\n<li>\n</li>\n</ul> Cookies and Web Beacons <p>We collect information that is typically not personally identifiable through the use of web technologies, including, without limitation, \u201csession cookies,\u201d \u201cpersistent cookies,\u201d \u201cJavaScript tags,\u201d and \u201cweb beacons\u201d (also referred to as \u201ctracking pixels,\u201d \u201cpixel tags,\u201d or \u201caction tags\u201d).\nAs the Internet evolves, we may implement and use different types of technologies for this purpose.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Cookies.</em> When you visit this website, your computer may receive one or more \u201ccookies\u201d in order to help personalise and support your use of this website, our services, and/or the services of our partners.\nA \u201ccookie\u201d is a small text file that is transferred to your computer\u2019s web browser by a web server, and can be read by a web server in the same domain at a later time.\nIf you do not wish to receive cookies or wish to manage when you accept cookies in general, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer.\nWe provide more information on this in the \u201cYour Choices\u201d section, below.\nAlthough you are not required to accept our cookies, if you set your browser to reject cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features and functionalities of this website.\n</p>\n<p>Cookies allow a website to customise information that is presented to you through your use of this website (such as to display personalised content and targeted advertising to you on your future visits to this website), and to save time by storing information so you do not need to re-enter it during a later use of our website.\nWe may place cookies on this site directly, or on behalf of the partner whose advertisement appears on this website or its service providers.\nIn general, cookies do not identify you personally.\nHowever if you have created a user identity on one of your visits to this website, we may link the cookie to information that identifies you personally.\nWe may use a combination of \u201csession cookies\u201d and \u201cpersistent cookies\u201d on this website, further described below.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Session Cookies.</em> A \u201csession cookie\u201d is a temporary cookie that expires when you close your browser.\nA session cookie assigns a randomly-generated, unique identification number to your computer when you access this website.\nAssigning your computer a number facilitates the proper functioning of the features of our websites by permitting us to maintain a persistent \u201cstate\u201d for your session, such as maintaining the contents of your shopping cart during checkout.\nWe also use session cookies to collect anonymous information (i.e., information that does not identify you personally) about the ways visitors use this website \u2013 which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page.\nWe analyse this information (known as \u201cclick-stream information\u201d) to better understand our visitors\u2019 interests and needs and to improve the content and functionality of this website.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Persistent Cookies.</em> Unlike a session cookie, a \u201cpersistent cookie\u201d does not expire when you close your browser.\nIt stays on your computer until the expiration date set in the cookie (for example, at the end of a calendar month) or until you delete it.\nPersistent cookies can be used to \u201ctag\u201d your computer so that the next time you visit (or someone using your computer visits), our server will recognise you, not by name, but by the \u201ctag\u201d on your computer.\nThis will enable us to provide you with a personalised experience even if we do not know who you are.\nIt will also allow us to collect more accurate information about the ways people use this website, for example, how people use this website on their first visit and how often they return.\nUsing persistent cookies permits us to provide you with a more personalised shopping experience and, in some cases, may save you the trouble of re-entering information already in our database.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Web Beacons.</em> When you visit this website, your computer may receive one or more \u201cweb beacons\u201d in order to assist us with delivering cookies on this website, to collect anonymous information about the use of this website by our visitors, and to deliver customised or targeted content to you on this website and through our partners.\nWeb beacons (also referred to as \u201ctracking pixels,\u201d \u201c1x1 gifs,\u201d \u201csingle-pixel gifs,\u201d \u201cpixel tags,\u201d or \u201caction tags\u201d) are graphic images, usually no larger than a 1x1 pixel, placed at various locations on this website.\nThey also help us identify browser types, search terms that bring visitors to our website, and the domain names of websites that refer traffic to us.\nWe may place web beacons on this site directly, and may place web beacons on behalf of the partner whose branding appears on this website or its service providers.\nThey also help us identify your IP address.\nThe information collected by web beacons does not identify you personally.\nHowever, if you have created a user identity on one of your visits to this website, for example, by making a purchase, we may link the information we collect using web beacons to the information that identifies you personally and use it in the same ways as we use the information we collect using cookies.\nWe also use web beacons to provide us with more information on any emails we send out.\nIn particular, a web beacon in an email communication will send us information to let us know that you have received, opened, or acted upon an email you have chosen to receive from us.</p>\n<p>If you accept a session or persistent cookie, you can delete it at any time through your web browser (e.g., as soon as you leave our website).\nIf you do not wish to receive cookies or wish to manage when you accept cookies in general, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer.\nAlthough you are not required to accept our cookies, if you set your browser to reject cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features and functionalities of this website.</p>\n<p>We and our partners use third party service providers, which may include but are not limited to Google Analytics and Omniture, to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet, and sometimes on this website.\nThese ads may collect anonymous information about your visits to the website on which such ad is placed, your interaction with these ads and the products and services offered by us, our partners and our suppliers through the use of a pixel tag or other web technologies.\nWe and our partners may use this anonymous information to provide targeted advertisements to you for goods and services.\nIf you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this anonymous information used, please visit www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp.\nYou may view a list of third party service providers who collect anonymous information, and/or opt-out of such collection of anonymous information about you, by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.\nIf you opt out of having your information collected through cookies, web beacons and other tools, your existing display advertising cookie(s) will be deleted and new cookie will attempt to be placed that instructs service providers not to track your future activities when that cookie is detected (a \u201cno-track\u201d cookie).\nIf your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit our opt-out page, a \u201cno-track\u201d cookie cannot be set on your computer.\nAlso, if you subsequently erase \u201cno-track\u201d cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, you will need to opt-out again.</p> ", "created_at": "2023-04-25 00:24:39.360254", "updated_at": "2023-04-25
