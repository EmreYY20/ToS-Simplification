to Arbitrate<p>This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in these Terms as the \u201cArbitration Agreement.\u201d You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Company, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms (including any alleged breach thereof), the Services, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.\nFurther, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.\nYou agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.\nYour rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief<p>YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.\nUNLESS BOTH YOU AND COMPANY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON\u2019S OR PARTY\u2019S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.\nALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.</p>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution<p>Company is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer\u2019s satisfaction by emailing customer support at contact@serenade.ai.\nIf such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d).\nThe Notice to Company should be sent to Serenade Labs, Inc., 45 Bartlette St., Unit 510, San Francisco, CA 94110 (\u201cNotice Address\u201d).\nThe Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.\nIf Company and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Company may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Company or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Company is entitled.</p>Arbitration Procedures<p>Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association\u2019s (\u201cAAA\u201d) rules and procedures, including the AAA\u2019s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the \u201cAAA Rules\u201d), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nFor information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org.\nInformation about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA\u2019s consumer arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration.\nIf there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration.\nThe arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement.\nAlthough arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms and applicable law.\nDecisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.</p>\n<p>Unless Company and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.\nIf the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA.\nIf your claim is for $10,000 or less, Company agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.\nIf your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</p>Costs of Arbitration<p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the \u201cArbitration Fees\u201d) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement.\nIf the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Company will pay all Arbitration Fees.\nIf the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Company will pay your portion of such fees.\nIn addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Company will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.\nAny payment of attorneys\u2019 fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</p>Confidentiality<p>All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</p>Severability<p>If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) titled \u201cProhibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\u201d above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.\nIf a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled \u201cProhibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\u201d are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief.\nThe remainder of the Terms will continue to apply.</p>Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement<p>Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, Company agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Services, you may reject any such change by sending Company written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above.\nBy rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>Termination<p>You agree that Company, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and discard any content within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if Company believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms.\nAny suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of Service, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities.\nCompany may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice.\nYou agree that any termination of your access to the Service under any provision of these Terms may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Company may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Service.\nFurther, you agree that Company will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Service.</p>\n<p>If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using Service.\nhowever all Subscription fees are non-cancelable and non-refundable except as expressly provided in the next sentence.\nIf you are a user with a paid Subscription, you may contact the Company within the first thirty (30) days of beginning your paid Subscription if you wish to terminate your Subscription and request a refund.</p>General<p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Company and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Company with respect to the Service.\nYou also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third party services, third party content or third party software.\nThese Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions.\nWith respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Company agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California.\nThe failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.\nIf any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties\u2019 intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect.\nYou agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.\nA printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.\nYou may not assign these Terms without the prior written consent of Company, but Company may assign or transfer these Terms, in whole or in part, without restriction.\nThe section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.\nNotices to you may be made via either email or regular mail.\nThe Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service.</p>Your Privacy<p>At Serenade, we respect the privacy of our users.\nFor details please see our Privacy Policy.\nBy using the Service, you consent to our
