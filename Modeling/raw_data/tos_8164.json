during your visit to this website, we collect and store only the standard data collected by all web server software.\nThat information is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Internet Protocol (IP) address used for your connection (but not your email address).\nThe IP address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your internet service provider or directly to your computer.\nWe use the IP address to

the results of such monitoring to appropriate officials.\nExcept for authorized law enforcement investigations, no attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits.\nUnauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under state law and federal statutes, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of

contains the Oregon Public Records Law.</p>\n<p>In the state of Oregon, laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by state government.\nAt the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right to access public records based on the privacy of individuals.\nBoth state and federal laws provide exceptions.\nWe may request personally identifiable information from you in order to provide requested services, but such information is handled as it would be for an in-person visit to a governmental office.</p> Personal information and nondisclosure <p>\"Personal information\" is information about a person that is readily identifiable to that individual, such as an individual's name, address and telephone number.\nSuch personal information may be exempt from disclosure if disclosure would constitute an unreasonable invasion of privacy under the circumstances.\nA domain name or Internet Protocol (IP) address is not considered personal information.\nMost information collected by state government is assumed to be open to the public unless specifically exempted.\nORS Chapter 192 contains the Oregon Public Records Law.\nUnder this law, individuals are permitted to request that public officials not disclose a public record that contains their home address and telephone number under certain circumstances.\nORS 192.445 specifies how to request non-disclosure.</p> Email <p>All information collected at this site becomes a public record unless an exemption in law exists.\nORS Chapter 192 contains the Oregon Public Records Law.</p>\n<p>See public disclosure section above for more information on email privacy.</p> Requesting personal information inspection <p>You have the right to review information collected about you by this site.\nContact the agency that provides the service you requested.</p> Secure transmission <p>This site uses the industry standard encryption software Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to enable secure transmission of data.\nThe URL in your browser will change to \"HTTPS\" instead of \"HTTP\" when this security feature is invoked.\nYour browser may also display a lock or key symbol on its task bar to indicate invoked secure transmission.\nIf these indicators are not present, information may be susceptible to interception by other parties.\nMost internet email communication is not considered secure.\nIf you are communicating sensitive information, consider sending it by postal mail or contacting the agency by phone.</p> Cookies <p>A cookie is
