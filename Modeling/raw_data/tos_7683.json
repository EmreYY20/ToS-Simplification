Services.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</strong>\n<br>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AS IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.\nIn-N-Out hopes to resolve any issues You have with the Services before needing a formal legal case.\nBefore filing a claim against In-N-Out, You agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting Customer Service as shown below or by mailing the details of Your issue to the following: In-N-Out Burgers, Attn: Legal Department, 4199 Campus Drive, 9th Floor, Irvine, CA 92612.\nIf In-N-Out is unable to informally resolve Your issue, You may proceed with a dispute against In-N-Out in accordance with the conditions herein.<br>\n<br>Except for certain types of disputes described below, You agree that disputes between You and In-N-Out (whether such disputes involves a third party) relating to these Services will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration.\nARBITRATION IS MANDATORY AND FINAL.\nYou should be aware that discovery and rights to appeal in arbitration are generally more limited than in a lawsuit, and other rights that You would otherwise have in court may not be available in arbitration.<br>\n<br>Notices of arbitration should be sent to In-N-Out\u2019s address provided above.\nThere shall be one arbitrator agreed to by the parties within twenty days of receipt by the respondent of the request for arbitration or in default thereof appointed by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) in accordance with the AAA\u2019s rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes, which are available at www.adr.org or by calling AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nThe parties may alternatively elect an arbitrator from JAMS in the event that an AAA arbitrator is not available to the parties, whether by location, cost, or otherwise.\nThe arbitration will be held in Orange County, California, U.S.A., or any other location upon which You and In-N-Out agree, and will be conducted in the English language.\nThe AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.\nIn-N-Out will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $20,000.<br>\n<br>Neither You nor In-N-Out will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims.\nYou are giving up Your right to participate as a class representative or class member on any class claim You may have against In-N-Out including any right to class arbitration or any consolidation of individual arbitrations.\nNeither You nor In-N-Out will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement to arbitrate.\nYou and In-N-Out each waive rights to trial by jury or to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.\nThis dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration.\nJudgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction.\nAny provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies, or awards that conflict with these Terms.\n<br>\n<br>In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to You or Your claim, You and In-N-Out agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions as described herein) will be brought in the federal or state courts of Orange County, California, U.S.A.\nBoth You and In-N-Out consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.<br>\n<br>Exceptions to arbitration: As an alternative, You or In-N-Out may assert claims, if they qualify, in a local \"small claims\" court in Orange County, California or any United States county where You live and work.\nYou may bring claims only on Your own behalf.\nYou agree that In-N-Out may seek preliminary or injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in Orange County, California to protect its rights or property pending the completion of arbitration.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Modifications</strong>\n<br>In-N-Out may revise these Terms on occasion and will post the most current version with the Services.\nIf a revision meaningfully reduces Your rights, we will notify You (by, for example, posting a notice with the Services or sending a notice to an e-mail address that You agree to provide).\nBy continuing to use or access the Services after the revisions come into effect, You agree to be bound by the revised Terms.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Trademark Ownership</strong>\n<br>The following trademarks are used and owned by In-N-Out Burgers,
