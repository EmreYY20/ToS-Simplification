<p>We take your privacy more seriously than FAANG.</p> We don\u2019t collect more information than we need to.\n<p>We have disabled request logging.\nThis is because it is extremely identifiable.\nThis means that, for example, what website you visited and what path you visited (like https://libreddit.projectsegfau.lt/r/cats), your IP address, your User-Agent will not be logged by us!</p>\n<p>Some of our services have things like databases and things, for example Matrix, but that should be pretty obvious the moment you make an account on there.\nThey may collect some things, however we barely even access those databases so you should be fine.</p>\n<p>Matrix logs IPs, there is nothing we can do to prevent that.\nWe will only check IP addresses whenever there is serious abuse coming from someone\u2019s Matrix account, so we can ban their IP from using Project Segfault services.\nThis includes, but is not limited to ban evading and harassment of communities and people.</p>\n<p>If you want the data we\u2019ve collected on you to be sent, please contact us on Matrix in this room, or e-mail us at contact@projectsegfau.lt.\nYou don\u2019t need an account on our Matrix instance in order to chat there, you can choose from a bunch of public instances or make your own.</p> For our website and blog <p>We have Plausible analytics installed on our website (the one you are on right now!), and our Blog, which means we can just easily see what part of our site you\u2019re on, what country you are from, what platform you are from, potentially a referrer and all those get clumped up together.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Plausible Analytics is completely anonymous.\nWe can\u2019t exactly figure out who you are through Plausible.\nIt is also GDPR compliant.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use analytics in order to see how many visitors we get every day, what pages get visited the most, what countries visit our website the most etc.\nuBlock and other privacy extensions block Plausible by default.</p>\n<p>If you would like to see our website\u2019s statistics, look no further.</p> We don\u2019t give any of the data we collect to anyone outside of Project Segfault.\n<p>What we just described above won\u2019t be sold or given to anyone outside of Project Segfault, except for anonymous analytics like the website.\nSome data could be given to law enforcement if they have a warrant.</p>\n<p>There is no reason for anyone outside of Project Segfault to see your data.\nIn fact, Project Segfault really has no reason to see your data, unless there\u2019s something to suspect.</p> Data may be cleared at any point upon request, but\u2026 <p>There are times when we are unable to delete \u201cyour\u201d data because we sometimes we do not have a concept of \u201cyou\u201d.\nIf you don\u2019t create an account on the services you use, we have no way to know what data is tied to \u201cyou\u201d as most logs are anonymized.</p>\n<p>Often times you can clear your own data simply by deleting your account.</p>\n<p>As we said, you can request any GDPR/Privacy things in this Matrix room.\nBut, if there\u2019s any ongoing investigations and
