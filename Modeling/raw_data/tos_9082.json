(excluding sales tax and tips), where you live, how long you have been Royalty, and, for certain Rewards, other factors that we will announce when we announce that the Reward is available to Royalty.\nYou can track the Rewards you have already earned and that you may earn by logging into your Account.</p>\n<p>If the credits you have in your Account don't qualify for a particular Reward, we will apply the credits towards one or more other Rewards that you can claim.</p>\n<p>Rewards and credits towards Rewards will be automatically tracked and allocated to each Royalty's Account by Red Robin in accordance with our official records.\nRewards have no cash value and are not exchangeable for cash.\nRewards have no value outside of this Program.\nRewards cannot be assigned, exchanged, sold, traded, bartered, purchased, given by gift or otherwise transferred.\nAny Rewards so acquired are void.\nThe accumulation of Rewards does not entitle the Royalty Member to any vested rights, and Red Robin does not guarantee in any way the continued availability of any Reward.</p>\n<p>All Rewards are subject to verification at any time for any reason.\nRed Robin reserves the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to invalidate any Rewards we deem to have been awarded in error, or as the result of any fraudulent or dishonest activity, or any activity not in keeping with the letter and/or spirit of these Rules, as interpreted by us in our sole and absolute discretion.\nAny Rewards that cannot be verified to the satisfaction of Red Robin are subject to

divisible in the case of divorce.</p>Red Robin Royalty<sup>\u00ae</sup> Rewards<p>To receive credit for your qualifying purchase and to redeem a Reward you have earned, present your Program Card or the phone number associated with your Account to your server or tabletop device at participating restaurant locations with your payment.\nYour server will enter your Program Card information or the phone number associated with your Account in the Program System, the fact that you visited the restaurant, and the items you purchased.\nYour Account will be automatically adjusted to show any credits you received and any Rewards you redeemed.\nIf ordering through the Mobile App or Online Ordering process, you must identify your Royalty Member Account by logging in with your Royalty Account information prior to purchase.</p>\n<p>You may redeem only one earned Reward per visit to a Red Robin restaurant, and you may redeem only two earned Rewards per day.\nIf you have earned more than one Reward, just present your Program Card or the phone number associated with your Account to your server with your form of payment, and our Program system will apply the highest ranked Reward that you have earned to your bill (see Reward Redemption section below for Reward rankings).\nThe Rewards you do not redeem will remain in your Account until you use them or until they expire, whichever occurs first.\nAll Rewards are subject to availability at the time of redemption request.\nWe may make certain Rewards available only while quantities and supplies last.</p>\n<p>If you visit a Red Robin restaurant with other Royalty Members, please ask your server to give each Royalty Member a separate check and apply the credits for each Royalty Member's purchases to that particular Royalty Member's Account.</p>\n<p>If you forget to provide your server with your Program Card or the phone number associated with your Account when you pay for your meal, not all is lost: you can still receive credits for your qualifying purchases by scanning and submitting your receipt to www.redrobin.com/pages/help/contact/ and selecting \"Add Credit to Account.\" You may use this process to add credits to your account for 30 days following your restaurant visit.\nYou will not receive credits for qualifying purchases that you purchase prior to Registration.</p>\n<p>All costs, fees and expenses incurred by a

permitted by law.&nbsp.\nThis includes claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior agreement as well as claims that may arise after the

DECISION HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED (OR THE DECISION IS OTHERWISE FINAL), THEN THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THAT PARTICULAR CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF MAY PROCEED IN COURT BUT SHALL BE SEVERED AND STAYED PENDING ARBITRATION OF THE REMAINING CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF.&nbsp.\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND RED ROBIN ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER LAW.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Additional Procedures For Multiple Case Filings/Mass Arbitrations.</strong> If twenty-five or more similar claims are asserted against Red Robin by the same or coordinated counsel or organizations or are otherwise coordinated, you understand and agree that the resolution of your Dispute might be delayed.\nYou also agree to the following coordinated bellwether process and application of the AAA Multiple Consumer Case Filing Fee Schedule.\nCounsel for the claimants and counsel for Red Robin shall each select 15 cases (per side) to proceed first in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a bellwether process.\nThe remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any AAA fees be assessed in connection with those cases until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a bellwether process.\nIf the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the initial 30 proceedings, each side shall select another 15 cases (per side) to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a second bellwether process.\nThe remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any AAA fees be assessed in connection with those cases until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a bellwether process.\nA single arbitrator shall preside over each case in any bellwether process.\nOnly one case may be assigned to each arbitrator as part of each set of bellwether proceedings unless the parties agree otherwise.\nThe group of arbitrators for any set of bellwether proceedings shall not be identical to the group of arbitrators for any other set, though, over time, individual arbitrators might preside over more than one arbitration in connection with bellwether proceedings.&nbsp.\nThis staged process shall continue, consistent with the parameters identified above, until all the claims included in these coordinated filings, including your case, are adjudicated or otherwise resolved.\nThe statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled for claims subject to this section from the time the first cases are selected for a bellwether process until the time your case is selected for a bellwether process.&nbsp.\nA court will have the authority to enforce these additional procedures, including by enjoining the mass filing or prosecution of arbitrations or the assessment or collection of AAA fees.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Enforcement and Invalidity.\n</strong>Subject to the provisions in the Class Action and Collective Relief Waiver above, if any part of this arbitration agreement is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal (other than that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis), then the balance of this arbitration agreement shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.&nbsp.\nIf, however, the portion that is deemed invalid, unenforceable or illegal is that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither claimant nor Red Robin shall be entitled to arbitrate their Dispute.&nbsp.\nAny changes to these Rules shall not apply to any Dispute to which you or we have already provided notice to the other party notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary.</p>Entire Agreement<p>These Rules and other documents incorporated by reference into these Rules, constitute the entire agreement between the parties and set out all the covenants, promises,

that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, Red Robin will reimburse as much of the AAA fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive to you as compared to litigation.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitrator\u2019s Authority and Decision.\nLocation of Arbitration.&nbsp;</strong> The arbitrator\u2019s decision, judgment, or award in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof.&nbsp.\nThe arbitrator shall issue a detailed ruling that includes essential findings of fact and law.&nbsp.\nThe arbitrator shall apply the provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 (cost-shifting) after entry of an award.&nbsp.\nIf the arbitrator finds that either the initiation of a claim, the substance of a claim, or the relief sought in arbitration was frivolous or was brought for harassment or an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11), the arbitrator may award attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and expenses in favor of a party.\nThe arbitrator shall apply Colorado law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor all claims of privilege recognized at law.&nbsp.\nIn any arbitration arising out of or related to these Terms, the arbitrator is not empowered to award punitive or exemplary damages, except where permitted by statute, and the parties waive any right to recover any such damages.&nbsp.\nIn any arbitration arising out of or related to these Terms, the arbitrator may not award any incidental, indirect or consequential damages, including damages for lost profits.&nbsp.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the arbitrability of any Dispute, the scope, applicability, interpretation, and enforcement of this arbitration agreement, and the interpretation, applicability, enforcement, formation of these Terms and/or the Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>Unless you and Red Robin otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside or another location convenient for you.\nIf the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000 and you do not seek injunctive or declaratory relief, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Red Robin submit to the arbitrator, unless a party requests a hearing and the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.\nIf such a hearing is determined to be necessary, you and Red Robin agree to personally attend.&nbsp.\nIf the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000 or seeks declaratory or injunctive relief, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nThe arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages on an individual basis and to grant, on an individual basis, any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual to the extent available under applicable law, the arbitral forum\u2019s rules, and this agreement.\nThe arbitrator's award of damages and/or other relief must be consistent with these Terms, including the Limitation of Liability section above as to the types and the amounts of damages or other relief for which a party may be held liable.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award shall be binding only between the parties to the arbitration proceeding and shall have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or other proceeding involving a different party.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Small Claims and Injunctive Relief.</strong>&nbsp.\nThis arbitration agreement does not preclude you or Red Robin from electing to have a Dispute heard in small claims court.&nbsp.\nIf the Dispute qualifies for small claims court, you or Red Robin may&nbsp.\nelect to have the Dispute heard in small claims court so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.&nbsp.\nThe determination of whether a Dispute falls within the jurisdictional limits of small claims court shall be for the small claims court to decide in the first instance.&nbsp.\nIn addition, you and Red Robin both retain the right to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for provisional or injunctive relief, including for pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with these Terms, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in these Terms.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Class Action and Collective Relief Waiver and Jury Trial Waiver.\nIndividual Arbitration.&nbsp;</strong> YOU AND RED ROBIN AGREE THAT TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER LAW, EACH MAY BRING A DISPUTE AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, COLLECTIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING.A DISPUTE MAY NOT BE CONSOLIDATED WITH A CLAIM BY ANY PERSON OR ENTITY THAT IS NOT A PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDING, AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, COLLECTIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING.&nbsp.\nTHE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING ANY DECLARATORY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO RESOLVE AN INDIVIDUAL PARTY\u2019S DISPUTE.\nTHE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT AWARD RELIEF FOR OR AGAINST ANYONE WHO IS NOT A PARTY TO THE PROCEEDING.&nbsp.\nTHIS CLASS ACTION AND COLLECTIVE RELIEF WAIVER IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND IF IT IS DEEMED INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE WITH RESPECT TO A PARTICULAR CLAIM OR DISPUTE, NEITHER YOU NOR RED ROBIN IS ENTITLED TO ARBITRATION OF SUCH CLAIM OR DISPUTE.\nNOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IF A COURT DETERMINES THAT THE CLASS ACTION AND COLLECTIVE RELIEF WAIVER IS NOT ENFORCEABLE AS TO A PARTICULAR CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF (SUCH AS A CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF) AND ALL APPEALS FROM THAT DECISION HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED (OR THE DECISION IS OTHERWISE FINAL), THEN THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THAT PARTICULAR CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF MAY PROCEED IN COURT BUT SHALL BE SEVERED AND STAYED PENDING ARBITRATION OF THE REMAINING CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF.&nbsp.\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND RED ROBIN ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER LAW.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Additional Procedures For Multiple Case Filings/Mass Arbitrations.</strong>&nbsp.\nIf twenty-five or more similar claims are asserted against Red Robin by the same or coordinated counsel or organizations or are otherwise coordinated, you understand and agree that the resolution of your Dispute might be delayed.\nYou also agree to the following coordinated bellwether process and application of the AAA Multiple Consumer Case Filing Fee Schedule.\nCounsel for the claimants and counsel for Red Robin shall each select 15 cases (per side) to proceed first in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a bellwether process.\nThe remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any AAA fees be assessed in connection with those cases until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a bellwether process.\nIf the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the initial 30 proceedings, each side shall select another 15 cases (per side) to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a second bellwether process.\nThe remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any AAA fees be assessed in connection with those cases until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a bellwether process.\nA single arbitrator shall preside over each case in any bellwether process.\nOnly one case may be assigned to each arbitrator as part of each set of bellwether proceedings unless the parties agree otherwise.\nThe group of arbitrators for any set of bellwether proceedings shall not be identical to the group of arbitrators for any other set, though, over time, individual arbitrators might preside over more than one arbitration in connection with bellwether proceedings.&nbsp.\nThis staged process shall continue, consistent with the parameters identified above, until all the claims included in these coordinated filings, including your case, are adjudicated or otherwise resolved.\nThe statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled for claims subject to this section from the time the first cases are selected for a bellwether process until the time your case is selected for a bellwether process.&nbsp.\nA court will have the authority to enforce these additional procedures, including by enjoining the mass filing or prosecution of arbitrations or the assessment or collection of AAA fees.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Enforcement and Invalidity.&nbsp;</strong> Subject to the provisions in the Class Action and Collective Relief Waiver above, if any part of this arbitration agreement is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal (other than that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis),, then the balance of this arbitration agreement shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.&nbsp.\nIf, however, the portion that is deemed invalid, unenforceable or illegal is that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither claimant nor Red Robin shall be entitled to arbitrate their Dispute.&nbsp.\nAny changes to these Terms shall not apply to any Dispute to which you or we have already provided notice to the other party notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary.</p>TERMINATION OF THE INTERFACES<p>Red Robin may, in its sole discretion and at any time, discontinue the Interfaces or any part thereof, with or without notice, or may prevent your use of
