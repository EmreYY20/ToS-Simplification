the parties concerning the subject matter hereof.\nNo prior or contemporaneous representations, inducements, promises, or agreements, oral or otherwise, between the parties with reference thereto will

unless in writing and duly executed by the party or parties to be bound thereby.\nThe failure of either party at any time to require performance by the other party of any provision of this Agreement shall in no way affect the right of such party to require performance of that provision.\nAny waiver by either party of any breach of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any continuing or succeeding breach of such provision, a waiver of the provision itself, or a waiver of any right under this Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>(m).\n</em>\n</strong> Severability.\nIf any provision of this Agreement is ruled wholly or partly invalid or unenforceable by a court or other body of competent jurisdiction, then (i) the validity and enforceability of all provisions of this

provision held wholly or partly invalid or unenforceable shall be deemed amended, and the court or other body is authorized to reform the provision, to the minimum extent necessary to render them valid and enforceable in conformity with the parties\u2019 intent as manifested herein.\nand (iv) if the ruling or the controlling principle of law or equity leading to the ruling subsequently is overruled, modified, or amended by legislative, judicial, or administrative action, then the provision in question as originally set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed valid and enforceable to

transfer of personal data as specified in Annex I.B.</p>\n<p>(d) The Appendix to these Clauses containing the Annexes referred to therein forms an integral part of these Clauses.</p>\n<em>Clause 2</em>\n<p>\n<strong>Effect and invariability of the Clauses</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(a) These Clauses set out appropriate safeguards, including enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies, pursuant to Article 46(1) and Article 46(2)(c) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and, with respect to data transfers from controllers to processors and/or processors to processors, standard contractual clauses pursuant to Article 28(7) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, provided they are not modified, except to select the appropriate Module(s) or to add or update information in the Appendix.\nThis does not prevent the Parties from including the standard contractual clauses laid down in these Clauses in a wider contract and/or to add other clauses or additional safeguards, provided that they do not contradict, directly or indirectly, these Clauses or prejudice the fundamental rights or freedoms of data subjects.</p>\n<p>(b) These Clauses are without prejudice to

Regulation.</p>\n<p>(b) These Clauses shall be read and interpreted in the light of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.</p>\n<p>(c) These Clauses shall not be interpreted in a way that

6</em>\n<p>\n<strong>Description of the transfer(s)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The details of the transfer(s), and in particular the categories of personal data that are transferred and the purpose(s) for

Appendix and signed Annex I.A, the acceding entity shall become a Party to these Clauses and have the rights and obligations of a data exporter or data importer in accordance with its designation in Annex I.A.</p>\n<p>(c) The acceding entity shall have no rights or obligations arising under these Clauses from the period prior to becoming a Party.</p> SECTION II \u2014 OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES\n<em>Clause 8</em>\n<p>\n<strong>Data protection safeguards</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The data exporter warrants that it has used reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able, through the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, to satisfy its obligations under these Clauses.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.1 </strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n<strong>Purpose limitation</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(a) The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B.\nIt may only process the personal data for another purpose:</p>\n<p>(i) where it has obtained the data subject\u2019s prior consent;</p>\n<p>(ii) where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings.\nor</p>\n<p>(iii) where necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.2 </strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n<strong>Transparency</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(a) In order to enable data subjects to effectively exercise their rights pursuant to Clause 10, the data importer shall inform them, either directly or through the data exporter:</p>\n<p>(i) of its identity and contact details;</p>\n<p>(ii) of the categories of personal data processed;</p>\n<p>(iii) of the right to obtain a copy of these Clauses;</p>\n<p>(iv) where it intends to onward transfer the personal data to any third party/ies, of the recipient or categories of recipients (as appropriate with a view to providing meaningful information), the purpose of such onward transfer and the ground therefore pursuant to Clause 8.7.</p>\n<p>(b) Paragraph (a) shall not apply where the data subject already has the information, including when such information has already been provided by the data exporter, or providing the information proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort for the data importer.\nIn the latter case, the data importer shall, to the extent possible, make the information publicly available.</p>\n<p>(c) On request, the Parties shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by them, available to the data subject free of charge.\nTo the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the Parties may redact part of the text of the Appendix prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand its content or exercise his/her rights.\nOn request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information.</p>\n<p>(d) Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.3 </strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n<strong>Accuracy and data minimisation</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(a) Each Party shall ensure that the personal data is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.\nThe data importer shall take every reasonable step to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, having regard to the purpose(s) of processing, is erased or rectified without delay.</p>\n<p>(b) If one of the Parties becomes aware that the personal data it has transferred or received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the other Party without undue delay.</p>\n<p>(c) The data importer shall ensure that the personal data is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purpose(s) of processing.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.4 </strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n<strong>Storage limitation</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The data importer shall retain the personal data for no longer than necessary for the purpose(s) for which it is processed.\nIt shall put in place appropriate technical or organisational measures to ensure compliance with this obligation, including erasure or anonymisation of the data and all back-ups at the end of the retention period.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.5 </strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n<strong>Security of processing</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(a) The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the personal data, including protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access (hereinafter \u2018personal data breach\u2019).\nIn assessing the appropriate level of security, they shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subject.\nThe Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner.</p>\n<p>(b) The Parties have agreed on the technical and organisational measures set out in Annex II.\nThe data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.</p>\n<p>(c) The data importer shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.</p>\n<p>(d) In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the personal data breach, including measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.</p>\n<p>(e) In case of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data importer shall without undue delay notify both the data exporter and the competent supervisory authority pursuant to Clause 13.\nSuch notification shall contain i) a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), ii) its likely consequences, iii) the measures taken or proposed to address the breach, and iv) the details of a contact point from whom more information can be obtained.\nTo the extent it is not possible for the data importer to provide all the information at the same time, it may do so in phases without undue further delay.</p>\n<p>(f) In case of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data importer shall also notify without undue delay the data subjects concerned of the personal data breach and its nature, if necessary in cooperation with the data exporter, together with the information referred to in paragraph (e), points ii) to iv), unless the data importer has implemented measures to significantly reduce the risk to the rights or freedoms of natural persons, or notification would involve disproportionate efforts.\nIn the latter case, the data importer shall instead issue a public communication or take a similar measure to inform the public of the personal data breach.</p>\n<p>(g) The data importer shall document all relevant facts relating to the personal data breach, including its effects and any remedial action taken, and keep a record thereof.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.6 </strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n<strong>Sensitive data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person\u2019s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions or offences (hereinafter \u2018sensitive data\u2019), the data importer shall apply specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards adapted to the specific nature of the data and the risks involved.\nThis may include restricting the personnel permitted to access the personal data, additional security measures (such as pseudonymisation) and/or additional restrictions with respect to further disclosure.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.7 </strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n<strong>Onward transfers</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(a) The data importer shall not disclose the personal data to a third party located outside the European Union (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter \u2018onward transfer\u2019) unless the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module.\nOtherwise, an onward transfer by the data importer may only take place if:</p>\n<p>(i)

data by the data importer, including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses.\nThis is based on the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.</p>\n<p>(b) The Parties declare that in

such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(f) Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g.\ntechnical or organisational measures to
