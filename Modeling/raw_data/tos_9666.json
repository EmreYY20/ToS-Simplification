Arbitrate and Waiver of Class Action Claims</li>\n<p>\n<strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION 14 CAREFULLY - IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You and Lumos Labs agree that these TOS affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.</p>\n<p>If a dispute arises, our goal is to provide you a neutral and cost effective means to resolve it quickly.\nMost disputes can be resolved informally.\nBefore filing a claim against Lumos Labs, you agree to try to resolve the dispute by contacting us in writing at Lumos Labs, Inc., ATTN: DISPUTE NOTICE, 16 Maiden Lane, Floor 6, San Francisco, CA 94108, or by email to legal-dispute-notice@lumoslabs.com.\nBefore we file a claim against you, we agree to contact you at the email address associated with your Account.\nIf the dispute is not resolved within 30 days of notice, either you or we may bring a formal proceeding pursuant to the following procedures:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>A.\nGENERAL.</u>\n</strong>\n<strong>YOU AGREE THAT YOU AND LUMOS LABS WILL RESOLVE THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY BETWEEN US ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO LUMOSITY OR YOUR USE THEREOF, INCLUDING THESE TOS (collectively, \"ARBITRAL CLAIMS\")</strong>, with a few exceptions set forth below.\nThe arbitrator, and not any court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement to Arbitrate, including any claim that all or any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration.<br>ARBITRATION IS DIFFERENT FROM COURT.\nTHE RULES, INCLUDING DISCOVERY, ARE DIFFERENT AND NO JUDGE OR JURY IS PRESENT AT AN ARBITRATION.\nIN SOME INSTANCES, THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION COULD EXCEED THE COST OF LITIGATION, AND THE RIGHT TO DISCOVERY MAY BE MORE LIMITED.\nTHE AWARD IS FINAL AND BINDING AND SUBJECT ONLY TO LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.\n<strong>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, ABSENT THIS MANDATORY PROVISION, YOU MAY HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>B.\nARBITRATION SERVICES AND RULES.</u>\n</strong> Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (\"JAMS\") will administer the arbitration using the JAMS\u2019 procedures and rules in effect on the date the Arbitration is filed (\"JAMS Rules\").\nIn the event the JAMS Rules are inconsistent with this Agreement to Arbitrate, this Agreement will prevail.\nJAMS is independent from us, and you may obtain copies of the current JAMS Rules, and other related materials, including forms and instructions for initiating arbitration, by contacting JAMS at 1920 Main Street, Suite 300, Irvine, CA 92614 1-800-352-5267 or www.jamsadr.com.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>C.\nFILING AND ARBITRATION FEES.</u>\n</strong> To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, we will pay the additional cost.\nIf the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, we will pay the fees invoiced by JAMS, including arbitrator and hearing expenses.\nExcept as explicitly provided herein, you are responsible for your own attorneys\u2019 fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>D.\nLOCATION OF ARBITRATION.</u>\n</strong> If your claim is for $7,500 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the JAMS Rules.\nRegardless of the amount of your claim, any in-person hearing will be held in the United States county where you live or work, San Francisco, CA, or any other location you and we mutually agree to.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>E.\nSETTLEMENT AWARDS AND FEE REIMBURSEMENT.</u>\n</strong> If you prevail, and the arbitrator issues an award that exceeds our best written settlement offer that we made prior to 30 days into the arbitration (or if we did not make a settlement offer before that point), then we will pay you the amount of the award or $7,500, whichever is greater.\nAlso, if you prevail, and the arbitrator issues an award that exceeds our best written settlement offer that we made prior to 30 days into the arbitration (or if we did not make a settlement offer before that point) and the amount of the award is less than $7,500, we will reimburse you for your reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>F.\nEXCEPTIONS TO ARBITRAL CLAIMS.</u>\n</strong> As an exception to this Section 14, you may assert claims on an individual basis, if they qualify under applicable rules, in Small Claims court.\nAlso, either you or we may bring claims to enforce intellectual property rights without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute resolution described in this Section 14.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>G.\nCLASS ACTION WAIVER.</u> YOU AND LUMOS LABS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nYOU FURTHER AGREE WITH LUMOS LABS THAT NEITHER YOU NOR LUMOS LABS WILL JOIN ANY ARBITRAL CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY IN A LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING;</strong> THAT NO ARBITRAL CLAIM WILL BE RESOLVED ON A CLASS-WIDE BASIS.\nTHAT NEITHER YOU NOR LUMOS LABS WILL ASSERT AN ARBITRAL CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE.\nAND BOTH PARTIES EXPRESSLY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO FILE A CLASS ACTION OR SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS.\nIf any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable or that arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then this Agreement to Arbitrate shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>H.\nNO RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL.</u>\n</strong> YOU AND LUMOS LABS ALSO HEREBY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL EVEN IF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IS HELD NOT TO APPLY.\n<strong>YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL IN THE EVENT THAT EITHER PARTY SELECTS ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>I.\n30 DAY OPT OUT RIGHT.</u>\n</strong> You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and the class action waiver provisions set forth in this Section 14 by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: Lumos Labs, Inc., ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out, 16 Maiden Lane, Floor 6, San Francisco, CA 94108, or by email to opt-out@lumoslabs.com.\nFor new users, the notice must be sent within 30 days of registering for Lumosity, and for existing users, the notice must be sent within 30 days of the effective date of this policy.\nIf you do not opt-out, you shall be bound to the terms in this Section 14.\nIf you choose to opt-out, Lumos Labs also will not be bound.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>J.\nCHANGES TO THIS SECTION.</u>\n</strong> We will provide thirty (30) days' notice of any changes to this section by posting on Lumosity, sending you a message, or otherwise notifying you when you are logged into your Account.\nAmendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on Lumosity or sent to you.</p>\n<p>Changes to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day.\nIf a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on \"Changes to This Section\" is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the section entitled \"Agreement to Arbitrate and Waiver of Class Action Claims,\" and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Agreement to Arbitrate and Waiver of Class Action Claims section in existence after you began using Lumosity.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>K.\nSURVIVAL.</u>\n</strong> This Agreement to Arbitrate and Waiver of Class Action Claims section shall survive any termination of your Account or Lumosity.</p>\n<li>General</li>\n<p>(a) <u>Severability and Waiver.</u> Except as set forth in the Agreement to Arbitrate and Waiver of Class Action Claims section, if any part of the TOS is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the TOS will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting yours and our intent as closely as possible.\nEither party\u2019s failure to enforce any term or condition in the TOS is not a waiver of its right to do so later.</p>\n<p>(b) <u>Transparency in Coverage Notice.</u> This link leads to the machine-readable files that are made available in response to the federal Transparency in Coverage Rule and includes negotiated service rates and out-of-network allowed amounts between health plans and healthcare providers.\nThe machine readable files are formatted to allow researchers, regulators, and application developers to more easily access and analyze data.</p>\n<p>(c) <u>Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue.</u> Except to the extent preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), the TOS are governed by California law without regard to conflict of law provisions.\nExcept as provided in Section 14, or to the extent preempted by the FAA, both parties further consent to the personal jurisdiction of and exclusive venue in the federal and state courts in San Francisco County, California as the legal forum for any dispute between them.</p>\n<p>(d) <u>Change Policy.</u> The TOS may be updated from time to time.\nIf we make material changes, we will provide advance notice to you either by email, by posting a notification on Lumosity or by posting an updated TOS on Lumosity at least 30 days in advance of the effective date of the updated TOS.\nPlease note that unless otherwise provided by applicable law or as set forth above in the Agreement to Arbitrate and Waiver of Class Action Claims section, your continued use of Lumosity following the effective date means that you agree with, and consent to be bound by, the updated TOS.</p>\n<p>(e) <u>Miscellaneous.</u> The TOS are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersede all previous written and oral agreements relating to the subject matter of the TOS.\nIf there is any conflict between the TOS and any additional terms, conditions, and rules posted by Lumos Labs on Lumosity, the TOS shall govern, unless otherwise indicated.\nSections 2-15 shall survive any termination of the TOS.</p>\n</ol>", "created_at": "2023-09-29 23:51:17.169898", "updated_at":

for example, provide health-related information, including the existence of certain health conditions.\nLumos Labs partners with researchers and educational institutions in conducting such

performance measures to users to allow them to evaluate their performance against other Lumosity users.\nAlso, in connection with our Human Cognition Project, we may disclose performance statistics to university collaborators to evaluate, study, and improve the effectiveness of our programs or human cognition more generally.\nIn these situations, all data is disclosed either in aggregate form or with information that can identify you removed.\nIn addition, when we work with university collaborators, we contractually prohibit them from attempting to re-identify individuals from data that has been de-identified.</p>\n<p>We also use reCAPTCHA v.3 feature of Google to determine whether inputs are made by a natural person or by potentially abusive automated tools (bots).\nreCAPTCHA uses data such as IP address and activity patterns (e.g., typing/mouse movements) to make such determination.\nreCAPTCHA is subject to Google\u2019s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</p>\n<li>Legal Bases For Use Of Your Personal Data</li>\n<p>The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal ground they rely on to use or disclose your personal data.\nTo the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows: </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To honor our contractual commitments to you: Much of our processing of personal data is to meet our contractual obligations to our users, or to take steps at users\u2019 request in anticipation of entering into a contract with them.\nFor example, we handle personal data on this basis for our premium users.</li>\n<li>Consent: Where required by law, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of your implied or express consent.\nWhere you have provided consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of the processing that was carried out prior to withdrawing your consent.\nTo withdraw your consent, please contact us at legal@lumoslabs.com.</li>\n<li>Legitimate

affected individuals, such as: <ul>\n<li>Providing a safe and enjoyable user experience;</li>\n<li>Customer service;</li>\n<li>Marketing;</li>\n<li>Protecting our users, personnel, and property;</li>\n<li>Analyzing and improving our business;</li>\n<li>Processing job applications.\nand</li>\n<li>Managing legal issues.</li>\n<li>We may also process personal data for the legitimate interests of our research partners, such as to provide cognitive training, research, and analytics for such partners.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Legal compliance: We need to use and disclose personal data in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.</li>\n<li>To protect the vital interests of the individual or others: For example, we may collect or share personal data to help resolve an urgent safety situation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>No Disclosure to Third Parties for Their Own Marketing Purposes</li>\n<p>We believe in protecting your privacy, and therefore do not provide your personal data to third parties for their own marketing purposes.</p>\n<li>When We Share Your Personal Information With Third Parties</li>\n<p>We may share the categories of personal information

other device to collect information about your use of Lumosity in order to (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our websites and other sites and (ii) report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our websites and use of Lumosity.\nWe also may allow other third parties

or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access Lumosity.\nWe also may share with third-party advertisers a hashed version of your email address, solely in non-human readable form for purposes of delivering tailored advertising.\nWe neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access Lumosity by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties.\nThose parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below.\nIf you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and

receive advertisements even if you opt-out of tailored advertising.\nIn that case, the ads will just not be tailored.\nAlso, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>\n<li>Data Subject Rights And Your Choices</li>\n<b>Account Review</b>\n<p>You may
