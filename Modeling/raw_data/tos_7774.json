operating system, device identifier, online identifier) and geographic location of your device, as well as date/time stamp, IP address, pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, the site(s), application(s), destination(s), and/or service(s) you arrived from, and other clickstream data.\nYour email address may also be used by us, in coordination with third party audience authentication service providers to enable OBA.</li>\n<li>Opt-Out of OBA.\nIf you do not want OBA, you may be able to opt-out by visiting www.aboutads.info, www.networkadvertising.org, www.youronlinechoices.com, and/or by clicking the \"Ad Choices\" icon that appears in advertising served through OBA.\nPlease note that these opt-out options only apply to tracking by third party business partners using cookie-based OBA across this Service and other sites, applications, destinations, and services, and not tracking among pages within the Service itself.\nAs may be required under applicable law, to opt-out of OBA enabled by use of your email address in coordination with audience authentication providers, visit https://optout.liveramp.com/opt_out, or see the Your Privacy
