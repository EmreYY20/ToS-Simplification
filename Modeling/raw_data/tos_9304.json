behaviour.\nCriticize ideas, never people.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Do not report every post that upsets you.</strong> Please report posts that violate our rules but for others that you may find

balance of probabilities by the moderators.\nIn other words, whether it is more likely than not that the content violates one or more of these rules.\nModerators will suspend an account from

rules.\nThe number of breaches leading to suspension is deliberately not defined.\nIn egregious cases, one breach can result in suspension of the user account.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe moderation team takes a pragmatic approach to every report they receive - if they feel that a problematic post isn\u2019t explicitly a breach of any of these rules but is inappropriate for Mastodon.world, the post will likely be removed.\nUsers who repeatedly post problematic content or otherwise are seen by the moderators as a negative, disruptive presence in our community can be removed at the discretion of the
