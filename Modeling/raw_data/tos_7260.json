outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information unless we provide users with advance notice.\nThis does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.\nWe may also release information when it's release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property or safety.\n<br>\n<br> However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.\n<br>\n<strong>Third-party links</strong>\n<br> Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our

we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.\n<br>\n<strong>Google</strong>\n<br> Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles.\nThey are put in place to provide a positive experience for users.\nhttps://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en <br>\n<br> We have not enabled Google AdSense on our site but we may do so in the future.\n<br>\n<strong>GDPR</strong> We offer the option to agree or disagree with providing consent related to GDPR in every game on the website.\n<br>\n<strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong>\n<br> CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.\nThe law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.\n- See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf<br>\n<br>\n<strong>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</strong>\n<br> Users can visit our site anonymously.\nOnce this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.<br> Our Privacy Policy link

signals?</strong>\n<br> We don't honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.\nWe don't honor them because:<br> we cannot be sure that all our advertising partners honor them.\n<br>\n<strong>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</strong>\n<br> It's also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking <br>\n<strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong>\n<br> When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.\nThe Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.<br>\n<br> We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.\n<br>\n<strong>Fair Information Practices</strong>\n<br> The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.\nUnderstanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</strong> We will notify you via email &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<strong>\u2022</strong> Within 7 business days <br>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.\nThis principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.\n<br>\n<strong>CAN SPAM Act</strong>\n<br> The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from

information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<strong>\u2022</strong> Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred.\n<br>\n<strong>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<strong>\u2022</strong> Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<strong>\u2022</strong> Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<strong>\u2022</strong> Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<strong>\u2022</strong> Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<strong>\u2022</strong> Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests
