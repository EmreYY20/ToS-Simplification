party.</p>16.Arbitration.\nWaiver of Class Actions<p>Before 'lawyering-up,' contact us.\nIf we can't resolve the issue, you agree to arbitration instead of going to court.\nWe also both agree not to bring a class action lawsuit against each other.</p>\n<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY \u2013 IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</p>16.1 Dispute Resolution<p>Before bringing a legal claim, you must contact our Support Team at support@glitch.com and describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and the specific relief you seek.\nMost disputes can be resolved this way.\nThe parties shall use their best efforts through this Support Team process to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and engage in good faith negotiations which shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</p>16.2 Arbitration<p>However, if the issue is not resolved within a period of 30 days from the date you contact the Support Team describing the dispute, then either party may pursue resolution of the dispute in binding arbitration, subject to the terms set forth below.\nEither party may pursue your dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.</p>\n<p>Specifically, except as described in Section 16.3 below, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including their formation, performance and breach), the parties' relationship with each other, and/or your use of the Services that does not involve patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, or moral rights shall be resolved via binding, non-appearance-based arbitration initiated through the American Arbitration Association ('AAA') in accordance with the provisions of its Consumer Arbitration Rules, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.\nExcept as explicitly stated otherwise herein, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration.</p>\n<p>The Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at (800) 778-7879.\nIn any such arbitration, the parties and AAA must comply with the following rules: (i) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online, and/or be solely based on written submissions, and the specific manner shall be chose by the party initiating the arbitration.\n(ii) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties.\n(iii) the arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity, including the award of injunctive or declaratory relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.\nand (iv) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be written and binding on the parties and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place in New York, New York or the federal judicial district that includes your billing address.\nIn the event you select the latter, we may transfer the arbitration to New York so long as we agree to pay any additional fees or costs which the arbitrator determines you incur as a result of the transfer.\nFor non-United States residents, arbitration shall be initiated in the New York County, New York, United States of America, and you and Glitch, Inc.\nagree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in New York County, New York, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>At any time during the pendency of the arbitration, if the respondent in the arbitration offers the claimant the amount requested in the applicable Demand for Arbitration, the respondent agrees to (a) accept that offer as full and complete settlement of the claims in the Demand for Arbitration and (b) voluntarily dismiss all claims in the applicable Demand for Arbitration with prejudice.</p>16.3 Exceptions<p>Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, we both agree that nothing in this agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either of us to: (1) bring an individual action in small claims court of competent jurisdiction, (2) seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction, or (3) bring an individual action in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.\nAlso, any party can ask a court to halt an action while an arbitration proceeding is underway.</p>\n<p>Additionally Section 16.2 above shall not apply to any claim that all or part of the Class Action Waiver in Section 16.4 below is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable shall be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.\nExcept as explicitly stated otherwise herein, all other disputes regarding interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Mutual Arbitration Provision shall be determined exclusively by an arbitrator.</p>16.4 Class Action Waiver<p>EXCEPT AS EXPLICITLY PROVIDED HEREIN, YOU AND GLITCH, INC.\nAGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>\n<p>Except as explicitly provided herein, any claims brought by you or us must be brought in that party's individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.</p>\n<p>THIS MEANS THAT YOU AND GLITCH AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A LEAD OR REPRESENTATIVE CLASS PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nHOWEVER, THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT SEPARATE INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS MAY BE CONSOLIDATED, UPON REQUEST BY GLITCH, IF THE ARBITRATOR DETERMINES THAT INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS RELATE TO OR ARISE OUT OF THE SAME OR SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TRANSACTION(S) OR OCCURRENCE(S).\nCONSOLIDATION MEANS THAT ANY AND ALL SEPARATELY INITIATED ARBITRATIONS THAT RELATE TO OR ARISE OUT OF THE SAME OR SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TRANSACTION(S) OR OCCURRENCE(S) ARE ALL HEARD BY A SINGLE ARBITRATOR IN A SINGLE ARBITRATION, AND THAT THE ARBITRATOR'S FINDINGS OF LAW OR FACT SHALL APPLY TO ALL EXISTING AND FUTURE INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS THAT RELATE TO OR ARISE OUT OF THE SAME OR SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TRANSACTION(S).\nIF WE REQUEST CONSOLIDATION OF MULTIPLE ARBITRATIONS, THEN ALL PARTIES TO THE CONSOLIDATED CASE(S) WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED THEIR RIGHT TO DESIGNATE AN ARBITRATOR AS WELL AS ANY CONTRACTUAL PROVISION WITH RESPECT TO THE SITE OF THE ARBITRATION.\nTHE ARBITRATOR SHALL CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS IF GLITCH REQUESTS A CONSOLIDATION OF ARBITRATIONS:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The arbitrations have a common question of law or fact;</li>\n<li>The issues in the multiple arbitrations are largely identical;</li>\n<li>There are common claims, disputes, and relationships between or among the parties in the different arbitrations;</li>\n<li>One or more parties is named in multiple pending arbitrations;</li>\n<li>The arbitrations relate to the same aspect of the Services or the same User Content;</li>\n<li>Consolidation will save time and resources;</li>\n<li>One party will be seriously prejudiced by having multiple arbitrations heard separately.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where individual arbitrations are consolidated in accordance with the provisions above, you agree that Glitch may make reasonable arrangements with AAA for the payment of filing and/or arbitration fees, and that those arrangements may differ from the standard AAA payment schedule\u2014provided that you are not obligated to pay any fees beyond those required by AAA, and the arbitration can be fairly conducted in accordance with applicable AAA rules and this Dispute Resolution, Arbitration and Class Action Waiver provision.</p>\n<p>By agreeing to these arbitration provisions, you are waiving your right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action.\nwe are also waiving these rights.</p>\n<p>Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver section is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable, shall be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.\nAll other disputes regarding the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Dispute Resolution, Arbitration, and Class Action Waiver shall be determined exclusively by an arbitrator.</p>16.5 30-Day Right to Opt-Out<p>You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the agreement to arbitrate or class action waiver set forth above.\nTo opt-out, you must send us a notice in writing within thirty (30) days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision, otherwise you shall be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions above.\nThe opt-out notice must include your name, address, phone number, the Account to which the opt-out applies, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of the agreement to arbitrate and class action waiver.\nThis procedure is the only way you can opt out of the arbitration and class action waiver provisions.\nYou must use this address to opt out:</p>Glitch, Inc.<br>Attn:Opt-out<br>228 Park Avenue South, Suite 52723<br>New York, NY 10003-1502<br>866-364-2733<br>\n<p>If you opt-out of these provisions, Glitch, Inc.\nalso will not be bound by them.</p>16.6 Fees<p>If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, you may be required to pay a fee to initiate the arbitration.\nIf the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, we will pay all other fees invoiced by AAA, including filing fees and arbitrator and hearing expenses.\nYou are responsible for your own attorneys' fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.</p>\n<p>If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the arbitration demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\nIn that case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.</p>16.7 Modification<p>Except for inconsequential changes that do not affect any rights or obligations herein, Glitch, Inc.\nwill provide thirty (30) days' notice of any changes to this section by posting on the Services, sending you a message, or otherwise notifying you when you are logged into your Account.\nAmendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on the Services or sent to you.\nChanges to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day.\nIf a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on 'Modifications' is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the section entitled 'Arbitration.\nWaiver of Class Actions,' and the court or arbitrator shall apply the most recent version of the 'Arbitration.\nWaiver of Class Actions' validly enforceable on you.\nYou may otherwise reject the change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to Glitch, Inc.'s address for opt-out notices, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, will survive.\nNotwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, any changes to this section shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against us prior to the effective date of the change.\nMoreover, if we seek to terminate the arbitration procedures from this Agreement, such termination shall not be effective until thirty (30) days after the version of this Agreement not containing the arbitration procedures is posted to our Services or otherwise sent to you, and shall not be effective as to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against us prior to the effective date of removal.</p>16.8 Survival<p>In accordance with Sections 14 and 15, this Section will survive the termination of your relationship with us.</p>17.Jurisdiction<p>This Agreement is covered by New York law.\nIf there is a dispute between us not subject to arbitration, we'll handle it in New York.</p>\n<p>Again, before resorting to litigation, we strongly encourage you to contact us at support@glitch.com to seek a resolution.\nIf you decided to pursue legal action, you agree that any claim or dispute you may have against us that isn't subject to mandatory arbitration must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in New York County, New York, except as otherwise agreed to by the parties.\nExcept to the extent applicable law provides otherwise, this Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflict of law provisions.\nAnd each party agrees to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within New York County, New York for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.</p>18.Special Provisions for Users Located Outside of the United States<p>We're in the United

be construed to reflect the parties' original intent.\nThe remaining portions will remain in full force and effect.</p>\n<p>The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.\nIf any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.\nAny failure on the part of Glitch, Inc.\nto enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be considered a waiver of our right to enforce such provision.</p>\n<p>Our rights under this Agreement will survive any termination of this

Processing Terms<p>We've Updated our DMCA/Trademark Policy!</p>\n<p>We've updated our legal section, which includes our Terms of Service, Privacy Statement, and DMCA/Trademark Policy.</p>\n<p>You might think it\u2019s the boring stuff, but it\u2019s important! We designed Glitch to be friendly, safe, and open, and with that comes a whole lotta legal language aimed at ensuring you can trust us with your data and code.</p>\n<p>We clarified our policies on DMCA takedown requests and trademark infringement claims.</p>DMCA Takedown PolicyCopyright Infringement<p>There are a number of actions you can take if you believe content available through our Services infringes your copyright.\nBut before pursuing any course of action, you should conduct an initial investigation to confirm a) you own the copyright to an original work and b) that the content on our Services is unauthorized and infringing.\nBe sure to consider whether fair use, fair dealing, or similar exceptions to copyright apply to your situation.</p>\n<p>There are also a number of actions you can take if you believe content you posted on our Services has been removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification.\nBut before pursuing any course of action, you should conduct a thorough investigation into the allegations made against your use of the content.</p>\n<p>If you have questions about copyright ownership, copyright infringement, or your particular situation, we encourage you to reach out to professionals.\nNothing in this document should be construed as legal advice.</p>\n<p>Please also know that only copyright owners, or authorized representatives of the owner, can report suspected copyright infringement to us.\nIf you believe any content available through our Services infringes another party\u2019s copyright, you should reach out to that copyright owner directly.</p>COPYRIGHT OWNERSCourses of Action for Claiming Copyright Infringement<ol>\n<li>Contact the user directly.\nWe strongly encourage this course of action.\nOften times, these matters can be resolved quickly between you and the user without third party intervention.</li>\n<li>Ask us to intervene on your behalf.\nIf the matter is not adequately resolved after contacting the user, or if you rather not communicate directly with the user, let us know and we can contact the user on your behalf.\nWe\u2019ll gather information about your claim and contact the user about your claim and request to have the offending material removed.\nThe user will be given five business days to challenge your claim.\nIn the absence of a response, we\u2019ll take the offending content down.\nIf the offending material is removed by the user, we\u2019ll notify you and take no further action.\nIf the user challenges your claim, we\u2019ll inform you that you may have to take more aggressive action, like file a DMCA takedown notice.</li>\n<li>Submit a DMCA takedown notice.\nIf your matter wasn\u2019t adequately resolved after pursuing one or both of the above courses of action, or if you\u2019d rather bypass the first two options entirely, you can submit a DMCA takedown notice to us pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the DMCA).\nBe mindful that by filing a DMCA takedown notice, you are starting a formal legal process.\nDO NOT MAKE FALSE CLAIMS.\nMisuse of this process may result in the suspension/deletion of your account and/or other legal consequences.\nYou may be liable for damages, including court costs and attorneys\u2019 fees, if you materially misrepresent that content on a website is copyright infringing.\nIf you have questions or doubts about this process or your situation, you should consult with a legal professional before deciding to pursue this course of action.</li>\n</ol>Putting your DMCA Takedown Notice Together<p>The law requires you provide us certain information before we can process your notice under the DMCA.\nYour DMCA takedown notice needs to contain the following details:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Your name, mailing address, telephone number, and email address.</li>\n<li>Sufficient detail about the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed.</li>\n<li>The URL or other specific location on our websites that contain the material you claim infringes your copyright.</li>\n<li>Any contact information you have for the alleged infringer.</li>\n<li>A statement by you stating that you, in good faith, believe that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law (e.g., \u201cI have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above as allegedly infringing is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\nI have taken fair use into consideration.\u201d).</li>\n<li>A statement by you stating that the information contained in the notice is accurate and that you attest under the penalty of perjury that you are the copyright owner or that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner (e.g., \u201cI swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\u201d).</li>\n<li>An electronic or physical signature of the owner of the copyright or a person authorized to act on the owner\u2019s behalf.</li>\n</ol>How to Submit a DMCA Takedown

disable the allegedly infringing material.\nWe will document the alleged infringements on which we act.\nWe will also forward a full copy of your notice (including your name, address, phone number, and email address) to the user(s) who posted the allegedly infringing material.</p>\n<p>If the alleged infringer does not respond to your DMCA notice, we will consider the matter resolved.\nLikewise, we will consider the matter resolved if you retract your complaint.\nHowever, if the alleged infringer submits a valid DMCA counter-notice, we will notify you, and you will have 10 business days to a) notify us that you are seeking a court order to prevent further infringement of the material at issue and b) provide a copy of a valid legal complaint filed in a court of competent jurisdiction.\nIf we do not receive this notice within the designated time frame, we will restore the material at issue.</p>ALLEGED COPYRIGHT INFRINGERSPossible Restoration of Removed ContentRetraction<p>If you believe that your content was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may seek a retraction of the copyright complaint directly from the complainant.\nThis is the fastest and most efficient way to resolve a copyright dispute.\nThe complainant can send retractions to dmca@glitch.com.\nThese retractions should: (1) identify the material that was removed or disabled and (2) state that the complainant would like to retract the DMCA notice.</p>Counter-Notice Process<p>If you believe that your content was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may also send us a written counter-notice.\nPlease know that a counter-notice is a legal statement.\nyou should engage in a thorough investigation into the allegations made in the DMCA takedown notice before submitting a counter-notice.\nWe also encourage you to consult with a legal professional if you have questions about your disabled/removed content or the counter-notice process.\nPlease be aware that if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity on the website was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) under Section 512(f) of the DMCA.</p>\n<p>If you decide to submit a counter-notice, the counter-notice must include the following information:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Your name, mailing address, and telephone number.</li>\n<li>Identification of the material that has been removed or disabled and the URL or other specific location on our websites at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled.</li>\n<li>A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.</li>\n<li>A statement stating that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, the Southern District of New York where Glitch, Inc.\nis located, and you will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.</li>\n<li>A physical or electronic signature.</li>\n</ol>How to Submit a DMCA Counter Notice<p>Your counter notice can be sent to our copyright agent at:</p>Glitch, Inc.<br>Attn:DMCA

who filed the original notice.\nIf you are concerned about your contact information being shared, you may opt to submit your counter-notice through an agent.\nYour agent will be required to submit the DMCA counter-notice with valid contact information and identify you as the content owner who the agent is representing.</p>What Happens After a DMCA Counter-Notice is Submitted<p>If the original filer disagrees that the alleged offending material was removed in error or misidentified, they may pursue legal action against you.\nIf we do not receive notice within 10 business days from the date the original filer receives the counter-notice that he or she is seeking a court order to prevent further infringement of the material at issue, we will replace or cease disabling access to the offending material.</p>Trademark Infringement<p>Unlike with copyright claims of infringement and the DMCA, there is no federal trademark statute that provides a clear procedure on how to deal with claims of trademark infringement.</p>\n<p>Regardless, we still take these allegations seriously.</p>\n<p>If you are a trademark owner, or agent of the owner, and you have a good faith belief that content available through our Services infringes on one or more of your trademarks, you should make an effort to directly contact the offending third party before submitting a trademark infringement report to us.\n&nbsp;Often times, these matters can be resolved quickly without third party intervention.</p>\n<p>If the matter is not adequately resolved, or if you rather not communicate directly with the user, please inform us in writing at:</p>Glitch, Inc.<br>Attn:Trademark Notice<br>228 Park Avenue South, Suite 52723<br>New York, NY 10003-1502<br>866-364-2733<br>trademark@glitch.com<p>Your notice must include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Your name, mailing address, telephone number, and email address.</li>\n<li>Sufficient detail about the trademarked work, including a list of goods and/or services for which the trademark is registered and the length of time you have been using the trademark on those goods and services.</li>\n<li>The countries or territories in which the trademark is registered.</li>\n<li>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (or similar foreign entity) registration number of the mark(s).</li>\n<li>Sufficient detail about the material claimed to be

infringed.</li>\n<li>Any contact information you have for the alleged infringer.</li>\n<li>A statement by you stating that you have a good faith belief that use of the trademark in the manner complained of is an infringement of the rights granted to you under United States or foreign trademark law.</li>\n<li>A statement by you stating that the information contained in the notice is accurate and that you attest, under the penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the allegedly infringed trademark.</li>\n<li>An electronic or physical signature of the owner of the trademark(s) or a person authorized to act on the owner\u2019s behalf.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once you submit your trademark notice to us, we will determine whether you provided all the required elements.\n&nbsp;If so, we will begin an investigation and will take action that we deem appropriate under the circumstances.\nThis may include suspension and/or deletion of accounts, usernames, content, and applications.\n&nbsp;If action is taken, please note that we will forward your claim to the alleged infringer.\nWe will also forward your contact information and notice of what action was taken.</p>\n<p>Please also note that we are not in a position to adjudicate complicated trademark disputes between third parties.\n&nbsp;We cannot act on claims that require complex legal analysis or factual investigation.\nOnce again, we encourage you to reach out to the alleged infringing party before pursuing a trademark infringement claim with us.</p>\n<p>Finally, if your notice is missing information or does not state a claim, we will let you know.\n&nbsp;You may be allowed to resubmit.</p>\n<p>Build fast, full-stack web apps in your browser for free</p>Try something
