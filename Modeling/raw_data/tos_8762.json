Rules:\n<ul>\n<li>Your UGC.&nbsp.\nAll of your UGC either must be original with you or you must have all necessary rights in it from third parties in order to permit you to comply with these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms.&nbsp.\nYour UGC should not contain any visible logos, phrases, or trademarks that belong to third parties.&nbsp.\nDo not use any UGC that belongs to other people and pass it off as your own.\nthis includes any content that you might have found elsewhere on the Internet.&nbsp.\nIf anyone contributes to your UGC or has any rights to your UGC, or if anyone appears or is referred to in the UGC, then you must also have their permission to submit such UGC to Landmark Properties.&nbsp.\n(For example, if someone has taken a picture of you and your friend, and you submit that photo to Landmark Properties as your UGC, then you must obtain your friend\u2019s and the photographer\u2019s permission to do so.)</li>\n<li>Speaking of Photos:&nbsp.\nNo Pictures, Videos, or Images of Anyone Other Than You and Your Friends and Family.&nbsp.\nIf you choose to submit photos to the Service, link to embedded videos, or include other images of real people, then make sure they are of you or of you and someone you know \u2013 and only if you have their express permission to submit it.</li>\n<li>Act Appropriately.&nbsp.\nAll of your Service activities must be venue appropriate, as determined by us.&nbsp.\nBe respectful of others\u2019 opinions and comments so we can continue to build Communities for everyone to enjoy.&nbsp.\nIf you think your UGC might offend someone or be embarrassing to someone, then chances are it probably will and it doesn\u2019t belong on the Service.&nbsp.\nCursing, harassing, stalking, insulting comments, personal attacks, gossip, and similar actions are prohibited.&nbsp.\nYour UGC must not threaten, abuse, or harm others, and it must not include any negative comments that are connected to race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or handicap.&nbsp.\nYour UGC must not be defamatory, slanderous, indecent, obscene, pornographic, or sexually explicit.&nbsp.\nYour UGC must not exploit children under the age of 18.</li>\n<li>Do Not Use for Commercial or Political Purposes.&nbsp.\nYour UGC must not advertise or promote a product or service or other commercial activity, or a politician, public servant, or law.</li>\n<li>Do Not Use to Solicit or Send Unwanted Communications.&nbsp.\nDo not harvest or collect email addresses or other contact information of others from the Service by electronic or other means for the purposes of sending unsolicited emails or other unsolicited communications.&nbsp.\nDo not solicit personal information from anyone or solicit passwords or personally identifying information for commercial or unlawful purposes.&nbsp.\nThis also includes not uploading, posting, transmitting, sharing or otherwise making available any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, solicitations, promotional materials, \u201cjunk mail,\u201d \u201cspam,\u201d \u201cchain letters,\u201d \u201cpyramid schemes,\u201d or any other form of solicitation.</li>\n<li>Do Not Use for Inappropriate Purposes.\n&nbsp;Your UGC must not promote any infringing, illegal, or other similarly inappropriate activity.</li>\n<li>Be Honest and Do Not Misrepresent Yourself or Your UGC.&nbsp.\nDo not impersonate any other person, user, or company, and do not submit UGC that you believe may be false, fraudulent, deceptive, inaccurate, or misleading, or that misrepresents your identity or affiliation with a person or company.\nIn the event you receive anything in consideration from us with respect to your UGC (e.g., coupons, sweepstakes entries, etc.) you represent you will include disclosure of the receipt of this consideration clearly and conspicuously as part of the UGC and include any other disclosures we may require.</li>\n<li>Others Can See.&nbsp.\nWe hope that you will use the Communities to exchange information and content and have venue appropriate discussions with other members.&nbsp.\nHowever, please remember that the Communities are public or semi-public and UGC that you submit on the Service within a Community may be accessible and viewable by other users.&nbsp.\nDo not submit personally identifying information (e.g., first and last name together, password, phone number, address, credit card number, medical information, email address, or other personally identifiable information or contact information) on Community spaces and take care when otherwise disclosing this type of information to others.</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t Share Other People\u2019s Personal Information.&nbsp.\nYour UGC should not reveal another person\u2019s address, phone number, email address, social security number, credit card number, medical information, financial information, or any other information that may be used to track, contact, or impersonate that individual, unless, and in the form and by the method, specifically requested by Landmark Properties (e.g., an email address to send an email invite to a friend).</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t Damage the Service or Anyone\u2019s Computers or Other Devices.&nbsp.\nYour UGC must not submit viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, or any other technologies or malicious code that could impact the operation of the Service or any computer or other Device.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you submit UGC that Landmark Properties reasonably believes violates these Rules, then we may take any legally available action that we deem appropriate, in our sole discretion.&nbsp.\nHowever, we are not obligated to take any action not required by applicable law.&nbsp.\nWe may require, at any time, proof of the permissions referred to above in a form acceptable to us.&nbsp.\nFailure to provide such proof may lead to, among other things, the UGC in question being removed from the Service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Your Interactions With Other Users.\nDisputes.&nbsp.\nYou are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or offline.&nbsp.\nWe are not responsible or liable for the conduct or content of any user.&nbsp.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and other users.&nbsp.\nExercise common sense and your best judgment in your interactions with others (e.g., when you submit any personal or other information) and in all of your other online activities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Appropriate Content and Alerting Us of Violations</strong>.&nbsp;We expect UGC to be appropriate for a general audience, but do not undertake to monitor it, and you consent to potentially encountering content you find offensive or inappropriate.&nbsp.\nWe may include venue and content rules as Additional Terms.&nbsp.\nIf you discover any content that violates these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms, then you may report it here.&nbsp.\nFor alleged infringements of Intellectual Property rights, see Section 6.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>SERVICE AND CONTENT USE RESTRICTIONS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Service Use

infringement, as set forth more fully below.&nbsp.\nIn Landmark Properties\u2019 sole discretion, Landmark Properties may remove content that may be infringing on another person\u2019s intellectual property rights with or without notice to the potential infringer.&nbsp.\nIn accordance with the U.S.\nDigital Millennium Copyright Act (\u201cDMCA\u201d) and other applicable law, Landmark Properties

you submitted to Landmark Properties is disabled or the work is removed as a result of a DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice, and if you believe that the disabled access or removal is the result of mistake or misidentification, then you may send us a DMCA Counter-Notification to the addresses above.&nbsp.\nYour DMCA Counter-Notification should contain the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a legend or subject line that says: \u201cDMCA Counter-Notification\u201d;</li>\n<li>a description of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled (please include the full URL of the page(s) on the Service from which the material was removed or access to it disabled);</li>\n<li>a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;</li>\n<li>your full name, address, telephone number, email address, and the username of your Account;</li>\n<li>a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or, if the address is located outside the U.S.A., to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Central

than fourteen (14) business days following receipt of the DMCA Counter-Notification.&nbsp.\nHowever, we will not do this if we first receive notice at the addresses above that the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice has filed a lawsuit asking a court for an order restraining the person who provided the material from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Service.&nbsp.\nYou should also be aware that we may forward the Counter-Notification to the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>NOTICES, QUESTIONS AND

applicable Additional Terms, (collectively, \u201c<strong>Dispute</strong>\u201d) shall be in Athens-Clarke County, Georgia.\nEach party submits to personal jurisdiction and venue in Athens-Clarke County, Georgia for any and all purposes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Pre-Arbitration Notification.</strong>&nbsp.\nLandmark Properties and you agree that it would be advantageous to discuss and hopefully resolve any Disputes before formal proceedings are initiated.\nprovided, however, that Landmark Properties need not do so in circumstances where its claims of Intellectual Property rights are concerned (\u201c<strong>IP Disputes</strong>,\u201d with all other disputes referred to as \u201c<strong>General Disputes</strong>\u201d).\nThe party making a claim \u2013 whether you or Landmark Properties \u2013 shall send a letter to the other side briefly summarizing the claim and the request for relief.\nIf Landmark Properties is making a claim, the letter shall be sent, via email, to the email address listed in your Landmark Properties account, if applicable.\nIf no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no notification or delay obligations under this Section 8.B.&nbsp.\nIf you are making a claim, the letter shall be sent to 315 Oconee Street, Athens, GA 30601 (Attn: Legal Department).\nIf the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after notification, the claimant may proceed to initiate proceedings as set forth in this Section 8.\nEither you or Landmark Properties, however, may seek provisional remedies (such as preliminary injunctive relief, subject to Section 8.D) before the expiration of this sixty (60)-day period.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration of Claims.</strong> All actions or proceedings arising in connection with, touching upon or relating to any controversy, allegation, or claim arising out of or relating to the service, these terms, or the scope of the provisions of this section (collectively, \u201c<strong>Dispute</strong>\u201d), shall be submitted to the American Arbitration Association (\u201c<strong>AAA</strong>\u201d) for final and binding arbitration, to be held in Athens-Clarke County, Georgia.\nArbitration shall be conducted pursuant to the Consumer Arbitration Rules then prevailing at the AAA if the dispute is with an individual consumer and pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules then prevailing at the AAA for all other disputes.\nIf the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $100,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a single neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than fifteen (15) years\u2019 experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the Dispute.&nbsp.\nIf the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $100,000, or if Landmark Properties elects in its sole discretion to bear the costs of arbitration in excess of those that would occur for a proceeding before a single neutral arbitrator, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a three-member panel, with one member to be selected by each party and the third (who will be chair of the panel) selected by the two party-appointed members or by the AAA.\nWe may have the right to pay the AAA fees if required for arbitration to be enforceable.\nThe arbitration shall be a confidential proceeding, closed to the general public.\nprovided, however, that a party may disclose information relating to the arbitration proceedings to its and its affiliates\u2019 lawyers, insurance providers, auditors and other professional advisers.&nbsp.\nThe fact that there is a dispute between the parties that is the subject of arbitration shall be confidential to the same extent.\nThe arbitrator shall issue a written opinion stating the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator\u2019s award is based.&nbsp.\nNeither party shall be entitled or permitted to commence or maintain any action in a court of law with respect to any matter in dispute until such matter shall have been submitted to arbitration as herein provided and then only for the enforcement of the arbitrator\u2019s award.\nprovided, however, that prior to the appointment of the arbitrator or for remedies beyond the jurisdiction of an arbitrator, at any time, either party may seek pendente lite relief (subject to the provisions of these terms waiving or limiting that relief) in a court of competent jurisdiction in Athens-Clarke County, Georgia or, if sought by Landmark Properties, such other court that may have jurisdiction over you, without thereby waiving its right to arbitration of the dispute or controversy under this section.\nprovided further, however, that the losing party shall have fifteen (15) business days after the issuance of the arbitrator\u2019s decision to fully comply with such decision, after which the prevailing party may enforce such decision by a petition to any court having jurisdiction over you, which may be made ex parte, for confirmation and enforcement of the award.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Limitation on Injunctive Relief</strong>.\nAS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU CLAIM THAT YOU HAVE INCURRED ANY LOSS, DAMAGES, OR INJURIES IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, THEN THE LOSSES, DAMAGES, AND INJURIES

apply the laws of another jurisdiction.\nThis Section 8 shall be governed solely by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a71, et seq., and not by the law of any state, and is enforceable pursuant to its terms on a self-executing basis.\nYou and Landmark Properties agree that we intend that this Section 8 satisfies the \u201cwriting\u201d requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.&nbsp.\nThis Section 8 can only be amended by mutual agreement.&nbsp.\nEither party may seek enforcement of this Section 8 in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nThe arbitrator shall determine any and all challenges to the arbitrability of a claim.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Class Action Waiver.</strong>&nbsp.\nAs permitted by applicable law, both you and Landmark Properties waive the right to bring any Dispute as a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action, or to participate in a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action regarding any Dispute brought by anyone else.\nNotwithstanding any provision in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures to the contrary, the arbitrator shall not have the authority or any jurisdiction to hear the arbitration as a class, consolidated, representative, or private attorney general action or to consolidate, join, or otherwise combine the Disputes of different persons into one proceeding.\nNotwithstanding the arbitration provision set forth above, if the provision regarding waiver of class, collective, representative, and private attorney general claims of this Section 8 is found to be void or otherwise unenforceable, any such class, collective, representative, or private attorney general claims must be heard and determined through an appropriate court proceeding, and not in arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Jury Waiver.&nbsp.\nAS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ALL

qualifying claim of General Dispute (but not IP Disputes) in small claims court, subject to Section 8.F.</p>\n<p>The provisions of this Section 8 shall supersede any inconsistent provisions of any prior agreement between the parties.\nThis Section 8 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any termination of your use of the Service or these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>DISCLAIMER OF

your rights, modify our methods for responding to your requests, and/or supplement our response to your requests, as we continue to develop our compliance program to reflect the evolution of the law and our understanding of how it relates to our data practices.</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>This California Privacy Notice (\u201c<strong>Notice</strong>\u201d) applies to \u201cConsumers\u201d as

collection, use, disclosure, and sale of California Consumers\u2019 \u201cPersonal Information\u201d (\u201c<strong>PI</strong>\u201d) as defined by the CCPA, except to the extent such PI is exempt from the notice obligations of the CCPA for the twelve months preceding the Effective Date.\nThis Notice also covers rights California Consumers have under the CCPA as well other notices to Californians required by other laws.\nThe description of our data practices in this Notice, as required by the CCPA, covers only calendar year 2019 and will be updated annually.\nOur practices in calendar year 2020 may differ, however, if materially different from this Notice we will provide pre-collection notice of the current practices, which may include reference to our general privacy

COLLECT</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Based on our 2019 data practices through the Effective Date, we give you notice that we collect the following types of PI about California Consumers, and use and share it as set forth below.\nThis notice will be updated annually, and our current privacy notices at the point of collection, and general privacy policies, may reflect more current practices.</p>\n<strong>Category of PI</strong>\n<strong>Examples of PI</strong>\n<strong>Identifiers</strong>\nThis may include but is not limited to: a real name, alias, postal address, prior address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, social security number, driver\u2019s license number, state ID number, passport number,

in, desired budget, lease term, and move-in date, whether you have pets, and any additional details you wish to provide.\n<strong>Biometric Information</strong>\nThis may include but is not limited to: genetic, physiological, behavioral, and biological characteristics, that can be used to establish individual identity, including but not limited to fingerprints, voiceprints, retina scans from which an identifier template can be extracted, and other physical patterns, and sleep, health, or exercise data, that contain identifying info.\n<strong>Internet Usage Information</strong>\nThis may

to: creating a profile about a Consumer reflecting the Consumer\u2019s preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, preferences, predispositions, behavior, attitudes, intelligence, abilities, and aptitudes.\n<p>The chart above reflects that categories of PI required by the CCPA.\nThere may be additional information that we collect that meets the CCPA\u2019s definition of PI but is not reflected by a category, in which case we will treat it as PI as required by the CCPA, but will not include it when we are required to describe our practices by category of PI.</p>\n<p>As permitted by applicable law, we do not treat deidentified data or aggregate consumer information as PI and we reserve the right to convert, or permit others to convert, your PI into deidentified data or aggregate consumer information, and may elect not to treat publicly available information as PI.\nWe have no obligation to re-identify information or keep it longer than we need it to respond to your requests.</p>\n<p>Return to Navigation</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sources of PI</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may collect your PI directly from you or from service providers, vendors and suppliers, credit reporting agencies, our affiliates, or other individuals and businesses, as well as public sources of data such as government databases.</p>\n<p>Return to Navigation</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Use of PI</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Generally, we collect, retain, use, and share your PI to provide you services and as otherwise related to the operation of our business.\nFor more detail on our disclosures and

Development</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Quality Assurance</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Security </strong>\n</li>\n<li>and <strong>Debugging</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional business purposes

to the government or private parties to comply with law or legal process, to the consumer or other parties at the consumer\u2019s request, for the additional purposes explained in our Privacy Policy, and &nbsp;to assignees as part of a merger or asset sale (\u201c<strong>Other Business Purposes</strong>\u201d).</p>\n<p>Subject to restrictions and obligations of the CCPA, our vendors may also use your PI for some or all of the above listed business purposes.\nOur vendors may themselves engage services providers or subcontractors to enable them to perform services for us, which sub-processing is, for purposes of certainty, an Other Business Purpose for which we are providing you notice.</p>\n<p>We may collect and use your PI for commercial purposes such as for interest based advertising.</p>\n<p>In addition, we may collect, retain, and use PI for the purpose of sharing it as set forth in the next section.</p>\n<p>Return to Navigation</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sharing of

RIGHTS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The CCPA is a new law and there remain differing interpretations of it and the regulations that implement it.\nAccordingly, we may from time-to-time update information in our notices regarding our data practices and your rights, modify our methods for you to make and for us to respond to your requests, and/or supplement our response(s) to your requests, as we continue to develop our compliance program to reflect the evolution of the law and our understanding of how it relates to our data practices.</p>\n<p>We provide California Consumers the privacy rights described in this section.\nYou have the right to exercise these rights via an authorized agent who meets the agency requirements of the CCPA and related regulations.\nAs permitted by the CCPA, any request you submit to us is subject to an identification and residency verification process (\u201c<strong>Verifiable Consumer Request</strong>\u201d).\nWe will not fulfill your CCPA request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we collected PI.\nPlease follow the instructions at our Consumer Rights Request page here&nbsp;and respond to any follow up inquires we may make.\nYou may also obtain information on how to make, and may submit, a request by asking a manager at any of our management offices.</p>\n<p>Some PI we maintain about Consumers is not sufficiently associated with enough PI about the Consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular Consumer\u2019s PI when a Consumer request that requires verification pursuant to the CCPA\u2019s verification standards is made (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID).&nbsp.\nAs required by the CCPA we do not include that PI in response to those requests.\nIf we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response.\nWe will use PI provided in a Verifiable Consumer Request only to verify your identity or authority to make the request and to track and document request responses, unless you also gave it to us for another purpose.</p>\n<p>We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify Consumer PI that we collect, process, store, disclose and otherwise use and to respond to your California Consumer privacy rights requests.\nIn some cases, particularly with voluminous and/or typically irrelevant data, we may suggest that you receive the most recent or a summary of your PI and give you the opportunity to elect whether you want the rest or not.\nWe reserve the right to direct you to where you may access and copy responsive PI yourself.\nWe will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests.\nprovided, however, that we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded or overly burdensome.\nIf we determine that the request warrants a fee, or that we may refuse it, we will give you notice explaining why we made that decision.\nYou will be provided a cost estimate and the opportunity to accept such fees before we will charge you for responding to your request.</p>\n<p>Consistent with the CCPA and our interest in the security of your PI, we will not deliver to you your social security number, driver\u2019s license number or other government-issued id number, financial account number, any health or medical identification number, an account password, security questions or answers, or unique biometric data generated from measurements or technical analysis of human characteristics in response to a CCPA request.\nhowever, you may be able to access some of this information yourself through your account if you have an active account with us.</p>\n<p>Your California Consumer privacy rights are as follows:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>A.\nThe Right to Know:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>i.\nInformation Rights:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to send us a request, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, for any of the following for the period that is twelve months prior to the request date:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The categories of PI we have collected about you.</li>\n<li>The categories of sources from which we collected your PI.</li>\n<li>The business or commercial purposes for our collecting or selling your PI.</li>\n<li>The categories of third parties to whom we have shared your PI.</li>\n<li>A list of the categories of PI disclosed for a business purpose in the prior 12 months and, for each, the categories of recipients, or that no disclosure occurred.</li>\n<li>A list of the categories of PI sold about you in the prior 12 months and, for each, the categories of recipients, or that no sale occurred.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To make a request, follow the instructions at our Consumer Rights Request page <strong>here</strong>&nbsp;email us<strong> here</strong>&nbsp;or call us at 1 (888) 914-9661 PIN 493149 and indicate that you are making a right to know categories request.\nIn order for us to look into your request, we first need to verify your identity, meaning that we need to make sure that you are the consumer we may have collected personal information about or a person who has been duly authorized to make the request on behalf of the consumer.\nWe are required to verify a consumer\u2019s request to know categories of PI to a reasonable degree of certainty, which may include matching at least two data points provided by the consumer with data points maintained by us, which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying the consumer.\nIf you fail to do so we will be unable to verify you sufficiently to honor your request.\nThe information you send for us to verify your identity will be used for this purpose only.</p>\n<p>For your specific pieces of information, as required by the CCPA, we will apply the heightened verification standards set forth in subsection (ii) below.\nPlease note that PI is retained by us for various time periods, so we may not be able to fully respond to what might be relevant going back 12 months prior to the request.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>ii.\nObtaining Copies of PI</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to make or obtain a transportable copy, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, of your PI that we have collected in the period that is 12 months prior to the request date and are maintaining.\nTo make a request, follow the instructions at our Consumer Rights Request page <strong>here</strong>&nbsp;email us<strong> here</strong>&nbsp;or call us at 1 (888) 914-9661 PIN 493149 and indicate that you are requesting to know the specific pieces of PI that we have collected about you.\nIn order for us to look into your request, we first need to verify your identity, meaning that we need to make sure that you are the consumer we may have collected personal information about or a person who has been duly authorized to make the request on behalf of the consumer.\nWe are required to verify a consumer\u2019s request to know specific pieces of PI to a reasonably high degree of certainty, which may include matching at least three data points provided by the consumer with data points maintained by us, which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying the consumer together with a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that the requestor is the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request.\nIf you fail to provide the data points we will be unable to verify you sufficiently to honor your request.\nThe information you send for us to verify your identity will be used for this purpose only.</p>\n<p>Please note that PI is retained by us for various time periods, so we may not be able to fully respond to what might be relevant going back 12 months prior to the request.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>B.\nDo Not Sell</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We do not believe that we sell your PI as \u201csell\u201d is defined under the CCPA, and until such time as we change this policy by updating this Privacy Notice, and provide a method to opt-out of sale, we will treat PI collected under that policy as subject to a do not sell request.\nTo make a request, follow the instructions at our Consumer Rights Request page here.</p>\n<p>There may be cookies and other tracking technologies associated with our online services that may provide data, which may be treated as PI under the CCPA, to other parties that may use it for their own purposes, which in turn may provide that data to other parties for their own purposes.\nWhile there is not yet a consensus, we do not believe that data practices of third-party cookies and tracking devices associated with our online services constitute a sale of PI by us and therefore we do not currently treat these activities as a \u201csale.\u201d Currently, a do not sale request to us will not affect these third-party activities.\nHowever, you can exercise control over browser-based cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser, and mobile devices may offer ad and data limitation choices.&nbsp.\nIn addition, third party tools may enable you to search for and opt-out of some of these trackers, such as the Ghostery browser plug-in available at https://www.ghostery.com/.\nYou can learn more about how to exercise certain choices regarding cookies and interest-based advertising at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/, &nbsp;http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices, and http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.</p>\n<p>For easy access, here are links on how to manage cookies from some of the more popular browsers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Chrome</li>\n<li>Firefox</li>\n<li>Internet Explorer</li>\n<li>Edge</li>\n<li>Safari</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We do not represent that these third-party tools, programs or statements are complete or accurate.\nClearing cookies or changing settings may affect your choices and you may have to opt-out separately via each browser and other device you use.\nCookie-enabled opt-outs signals may no longer be effective if you delete, block or clear cookies.\nWe are not responsible for the completeness, accuracy or effectiveness of any third-party notices or choices<strong>.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Some browsers have signals that may be characterized as do not track signals, but we do not understand them to operate in that manner or to indicate a do not sell expression by you so we currently do not recognize these as a do not sell request.&nbsp;Further, there is not currently a consensus as to how various user-enabled privacy or \u201cdo not track\u201d signals or settings should be treated or what they mean, so we will not look for or respond to any that are not expressly listed here as programs in which we participate or otherwise accept, which may change as programs evolve.\nWe understand that various parties are developing do not sell signals and we may recognize certain such signals if we conclude such a program is appropriate.</p>\n<p>We do not knowingly sell the PI of Consumers under 16.</p>\n<p>We may disclose your PI for the following purposes, which are not a sale: (i) if you direct us to share PI.\n(ii) to comply with your requests under the CCPA.\n(iii) disclosures amongst the entities that constitute Landmark Properties as defined above, or as part of a merger or asset sale.\nand (iv) as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>C.\nDelete:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Except to the extent we have a basis for retention under CCPA, you may request that we delete your PI that we have collected directly from you and are maintaining.\nOur retention rights include, without limitation, to complete transactions and service you have requested or that are reasonably anticipated, for security purposes, for legitimate internal business purposes, including maintaining business records, to comply with law, to exercise or defend legal claims, and to cooperate with law enforcement.\nNote also that we are not required to delete your PI that we did not collect directly from you.</p>\n<p>To make a request,follow the instructions at our Consumer Rights Request page <strong>here</strong>&nbsp;email us<strong> here</strong>&nbsp;or call us at 1 (888) 914-9661 PIN 493149and indicate that you are making a request to delete your PI.\nIn order for us to look into your request, we first need to verify your identity, meaning that we need to make sure that you are the consumer we may have collected personal information about or a person who has been duly authorized to make the request on behalf of the consumer.\nWe are required to verify a consumer\u2019s request to delete to a reasonable degree of certainty, which may include matching at least two data points provided by the consumer with data points maintained by us, or to a reasonably high degree of certainty, which may include matching at least three data points provided by the consumer with data points maintained by us, depending on the sensitivity of the PI and the risk of harm to the consumer posted by unauthorized deletion.\nIf you fail to provide the data points we will be unable to verify you sufficiently to honor your request.\nThe information you send for us to verify your identity will be used for this purpose only.</p>\n<p>However, you may alternatively exercise a more limited control of your PI by instead exercising one of the following more limited opt-out, such as op exercising a more limited opt-out, such as opting out of marketing communications.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>D.\nNon-Discrimination and Financial Incentive Programs:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We will not discriminate against you in a manner prohibited by the CCPA because you exercise your CCPA rights.&nbsp.\nWe do not currently offer financial incentive programs or charge a different price or rate, or offer a different level or quality of good or service that relates to your data.&nbsp.\nIf this policy changes, the material aspects of that policy will be explained and described in its program terms in accordance with the CCPA.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>E.\nAuthorized Agents:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If a Consumer chooses to submit a request through an authorized agent, we require the Consumer to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide the authorized agent signed permission by the Consumer to submit a request, a copy of which must be provided to us;</li>\n<li>Verify their own identity directly with us;</li>\n<li>Directly confirm with us that they provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the authorized agent has a power of attorney issued under California Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465, then the written agreement is not necessary.\nPursuant to Probate Code Sections 4121 and 4122, a power of attorney is only valid if it is notarized or witnessed by two adults other than the attorney-in-fact.\nWhere witnesses are used rather than a notary, we require verification of the witnesses\u2019 identities, and verification that they in fact witnessed the appointment.\nThe power of attorney must be sufficiently broad, or specific, to establish agency to make a CCPA request.\nWe are entitled to reject any request submitted through a power of attorney if the attorney-in-fact cannot reasonably verify the validity of the power of attorney.</p>\n<p>If the authorized agent is not authorized by a power of attorney, we require an agent that is an entity be registered with the Secretary of State to conduct business in California.\nWe are entitled to verify the legitimacy of an agency appointment, such as through a representation under the penalty of perjury with two verified witnesses.&nbsp;We are entitled to require a natural person acting on behalf of an entity agent to attest under penalty of perjury with two verified witnesses that (1) they are authorized to act on behalf of the entity and the consumer.\n(2) they are who they claim to be.\nand (3) everything they have submitted is valid and accurate.\nWe are entitled to require the same of an individual acting as an agent, except for the qualification that they be registered with the Secretary of State to do business in California.</p>\n<p>In the absence of any of the general conditions detailed above, we are entitled to reject any request submitted through an agent.\nIn addition, the agent is subject to the verification standards applicable to the type of request(s) made.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>F.\nLimitation of Rights:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, we may collect, use and disclose your PI as required or permitted by applicable law and this may override your CCPA rights.\nIn addition, we need not honor any of your requests to the extent that doing so would infringe upon our or any other person or party\u2019s rights or conflict with applicable law.</p>\n<p>Return to Navigation</p>\n<p>\n<strong>ADDITIONAL CALIFORNIA NOTICES</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In addition to CCPA rights, certain Californians are entitled to certain other notices,
