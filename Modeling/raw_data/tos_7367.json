DNS<p>PrivadoVPN offers a smart DNS service (\u201cControl Tower\u201d) to users that want to block ads &amp.\ntrackers, block IP level threats, and bypass geo-restrictions without the need to install

user registers an IP address by using the \u201cControl Tower\u201d page on the PrivadoVPN website.</p>\n<p>IP addresses registered with Control Tower are only used to identify authorized devices and not used for any other purpose.\nControl Tower does not keep logs of which proxy server IPs are used by a user and we do not have access to this data.\nWe do not have any way to link any online activity to any individual account.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Please Note:</strong> The PrivadoVPN client allows a user to take advantage of Control Tower without registering an IP address.\nThe PrivadoVPN

the disk encryption) there would be no logs or information that could be tied an individual user.</p>\n<br>Changes to this Policy<p>\n<strong>We reserve the right to review and change this Policy at
