this.\nSince we only support Paypal donations at this moment we can't offer you any other method to make a donation.\nPlease don't ask.\nThe only suggestion we can do is that you find somebody else in the community that you really trust who is able to make donations and let him/her make the donation for you and transfer the credit back to your account by using the \"Contact Staff\" button.\nIf you opt for this idea, we take no responsibility for the outcome.\nUse common sense.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>I donated but didn't get any credit!</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nDepending on the financing source (Credit Card/Paypal balance/Bank account), Paypal might need a couple of days before they have withdrawn the money from your financing source.\nIf this happens, your donation status is shown as \"Uncleared\" or \"Pending\" in Paypal.\nIn this stage, the donation has not been transferred to us yet and, therefore, you will not receive your credit.\nOnce the donation is \"Completed\" on Paypal's side, we get

ways.\nThese banned clients include Shareaza, Fando, eDonkey (libtorrent), MLdonkey, Transmission, BitComet (and any client based on it such as BitLord) and CFNetwork.\nMany older versions of Azureus and uTorrent are banned, mostly for announcing too often.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>For a full up-to-date list of which clients can and can't be used, see this link.</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nSome Windows clients we recommend:\n<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Azureus\n(Full-featured.\nportable.\nprovides very reliable statistics to the tracker.)</li>\n<li>uTorrent\n(Highly Recommended.\nUses very little system resources.)</li>\n<br> Clients in alpha or beta version should be avoided.\n<br>\n<br> For more information to assist in selecting a BitTorrent client, see: Comparison of BitTorrent clients at Wikipedia.\n</ul>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Most common reason for stats not updating</b>\n<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>The user is cheating.\n(a.k.a.\n\"Summary Ban\")</li>\n<li>The server is overloaded and unresponsive.\nJust try to keep the session open until the server responds again.\n(Flooding the server with consecutive manual updates is not recommended.)</li>\n<li>You are using a faulty client.\nIf you want to use an experimental or CVS version you do it at your own risk.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Best practices</b>\n<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>If a torrent you are currently leeching/seeding is not listed on your profile, just wait or force a manual update.</li>\n<li>Make sure you exit your client properly, so that the tracker receives \"event=completed\".</li>\n<li>If the tracker is down, do not stop seeding.\nAs long as the tracker is back up before you exit the client the stats should update properly.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Why is a torrent I'm leeching/seeding listed several times in my profile?</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nIf for some reason (e.g.\npc crash, or frozen client) your client exits improperly and you restart it,\nit will have a new peer_id, so it will show as a new torrent.\nThe old one will never receive a \"event=completed\"\nor \"event=stopped\" and will be listed until some tracker timeout.\nJust ignore it, it will eventually go away.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>I've finished or cancelled a torrent.\nWhy is it still listed in my profile?</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nSome clients, notably TorrentStorm and Nova Torrent, do not report properly to the tracker when canceling or finishing a torrent.\nIn that case the tracker will keep waiting for some message - and thus listing the torrent as seeding or leeching - until some\ntimeout occurs.\nJust ignore it, it will eventually go away.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Why do I sometimes see torrents I'm not leeching in my profile!?</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nThis should never happen.\nIf it does, immediately change your password with Profile, change your passkey with 'Reset Passkey' and contact a staff person to remove the torrents that aren't yours.\nIf this happens, you will not get credit for the lost ratio as you're the one responsible for guarding your own account information.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Multiple IPs (Can I login from different computers?)</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nYes, the tracker is always capable of following sessions from different IPs for the same user.\nA torrent is associated with a passkey (which is included inside the .torrent file).\nWe always know who you are and your stats will not be mixed up with anyone else with a similar IP address.\nTo utilize this, you must have your 'Login Type' set to normal.\nThe option is located in your Profile.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>How does NAT/ICS change the picture?</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nIt makes no difference whatsoever.\nThe site will recognize you by your browser cookies while the tracker will recognize you by your passkey.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br> Uploading <br>\n<b>Why can't I upload torrents?</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nYou probably do not have your bitTorrent client setup correctly.\nMake sure you have used the tracker's announce url and the information areas are filled in correctly.\n<br>\n<p>1) This is a guide explaining how to upload torrents using the BitTorrent client <b>Azureus</b>.<br>\n</p>\n\ufffd Download Azureus from here: 'Azureus.'<br>\n\ufffd Go to the preferences (Azureus-&gt;Preferences).<br>\n\ufffd In the \"Server\" page change the \"Incoming TCP listen port\" to a non Peer-to-Peer port (6879 will work).\nIf you have a firewall make sure this port range is open in both directions.<br>\n\ufffd Time to create a torrent to upload (File-&gt;Create a Torrent).<br>\n\ufffd In the \"Announce URL\" put \"<b>http://www.thegeeks.click:3210/announce</b>\".<br>\n\ufffd Click the \"Browse\" button and find the file you want to share then click \"Next\".<br>\n\ufffd Check to see if the right file is selected and click \"Finish\".<br>\n\ufffd Voila, the torrent will be created where the file is.<br>\n\ufffd Login to the site 'TheGeeks' and go to the \"Upload\" section.<br>\n\ufffd In the \"Torrent file\" area click the \"Browse\" button and find the torrent file then click \"Open\".<br>\n\ufffd In the \"Torrent name\" area type the name of the file if the name on the torrent is not descriptive.<br>\n\ufffd In the \"Description\" area type a thorough description of the file.\nMake sure the description is complete and includes all relevant information.\nDO NOT POST SERIALS/CRACKS.\n<br>\n\ufffd In the \"Type\" area choose the type of file by clicking on the pull down menu.\nMake sure the file is under the correct type.<br>\n\ufffd Check over the following steps and if everything is correct click the \"Do it!\" button.<br>\n\ufffd Time to seed the torrent: download the torrent off the site, click \"Open\"(File-&gt;Open-&gt;.torrent File), and find the downloaded torrent.\nYou will not be able to seed the torrent created by the client because of the passkey that needs to be embedded in the torrent.<br>\n<br>\nIt will take a couple minutes for your torrent to appear in the \"Browse\" section.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Can I upload your torrents to other trackers?</b>\n<br>\n<br>No.\nWe are a closed, limited-membership community.\nOnly registered users can use TheGeeks (TB tracker).\nPosting our .torrent files on other trackers is useless, since most people who attempt to download them will\nbe unable to connect with us.\nThis generates a lot of frustration and bad-will against TheGeeks,\nand will therefore not be tolerated.\nAny user found leaking .torrent files will be permanently banned.<br>\n<br>\nComplaints from other sites' administrative staff about our torrents being posted on their sites will\nresult in the banning of the users responsible.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>How do I upload Exclusives?</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nTo upload an exclusive, first you must have the ability enabled on your account.\nContact a staff member and ask them to 'Enable exclusive upload on your account'.\nThis is only needs to be performed once.\nOnce this option is set, a new section will appear at the bottom of the upload page.\nIt is at this location that you set the class delays.\nIt is self-explanatory, but if you need further help, contact a staff memeber.\nAfter you have completed this section, upload the torrent.\nIf you need to setup ratio free downloads for the donators, you go to the details page for the torrent that you've just uploaded.\nClick the 'Edit Torrent' link on the page.\nAt the bottom of the Edit page, you setup the donators from a list.\nThese people will automatically have ratio-free downloads and will have immediate access to the torrent.\n<br> Downloading <br>\n<b>What are exclusives / Why are some torrents green?</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nExclusive products (torrents that are green) are torrents that are purchased by users here (or in groups of users) or are torrents that started their lives on the internet on this site.\nAccess to these torrents are controlled via user classes.\nSome key points are below:\n<br>\n<br>\n<li>The torrent's description will show the wait times for user classes.</li>\n<li>Torrents have *varying* wait times depending on variety of factors.\n(Not all of them are the same)</li>\n<li>\n</li>\n<li>Not all exclusives are available to ALL user classes (for example, some are only available to Power Users and above).</li>\n<li>Asking to get access to an exclusive (if you didn't help purchase it), will get you BANNED.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Donating to the site does NOT give you access to download exclusives (However it may help you jump into a new user class that can).</b>\n</li>\n<li>If you try to download one and it says \"Not Available for your User Class\", it's just that: Not available to your user class.\nYou need to get promoted to a higher one (read the FAQ again if you don't understand how).</li>\n<li>There's currently no way to filter out (not see in Browse) what you can't download.</li>\n<li>Complaining about the wait times isn't going to let you download it any faster.</li>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Are the files here safe to download?</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nYes.\nHowever, the Internet can be a very dangerous place.\nAnd because of the fluidity of the Internet, what's safe today may not be safe tomorrow.\nTherefore, we highly recommend that ALL of our users use an antivirus program on their computers.\nThe virus definitions should always be up-to-date and you should regularly scan your system.\nSome free antivirus programs are:\n<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>avast! Free Edition<br>\n</li>\n<li>AVG Free Edition<br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nAlso, install and maintain a Firewall product and use an up-to-date Anti-Spyware product, where necessary.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>How do I use the files I've downloaded?</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nCheck out this guide.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Why are some torrents marked (FREE)?</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nTorrents marked <b>FREE</b> are freeleech meaning they can be downloaded without affecting users' ratios.\nIf you feel your torrent deserves this status please Contact Staff.\nHowever, we only agree under exceptional circumstances.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Why did an active torrent suddenly disappear?</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nThere may be three reasons for this:<br>\n<b>1.</b>) The torrent may have been out-of-sync with the site\nrules.<br>\n<b>2.</b>) The uploader may have deleted it because it was a bad release.\nA replacement will probably be uploaded to take its place.<br>\n<b>3.</b>) Torrents are automatically deleted after 35 days of inactivity (no seeders).<br>\n<br>\nCheck the Log for more information.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>How do I resume a broken download or reseed something?</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nOpen the .torrent file.\nWhen your client asks you for a location, choose the location of\nthe existing file(s) and it will resume/reseed the torrent.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Why do my downloads sometimes stall at 99%?</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe more pieces you have, the harder it becomes to find peers who have pieces you are missing.\nThat is why downloads sometimes slow down or even stall when there are just a few percent remaining.\nJust be patient and you will, sooner or later, get the remaining pieces.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>What are these \"a piece has failed an hash check\" messages?</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nBittorrent clients check the data they receive for integrity.\nWhen a piece fails this check it is\nautomatically re-downloaded.\nOccasional hash fails are a common occurrence, and you shouldn't worry.<br>\n<br>\nSome clients have an (advanced) option/preference to 'kick/ban clients that send you bad data' or\nsimilar.\nIt should be turned on, since it makes sure that if a peer repeatedly sends you pieces that\nfail the hash check it will be ignored in the future.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>The torrent is supposed to be 100MB.\nHow come I downloaded 120MB?</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nSee the hash fails topic.\nIf your client receives bad data it will have to redownload it, therefore the total downloaded may be larger than the torrent size.\nMake sure the \"kick/ban\" option is turned on\nto minimize the extra downloads.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br> How can I improve my download speed? <br>\nThe download speed mostly depends on the seeder-to-leecher ratio (SLR).\nPoor download speed is\nmainly a problem with new and very popular torrents where the SLR is low.<br>\n<br>\n(Proselytising sidenote: make sure you remember that you did not enjoy the low speed.\n<b>Seed</b> so that others will not endure the same.)<br>\n<br>\nThere are a couple of things that you can try on your end to improve your speed:<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Do not immediately jump on new torrents</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nIn particular, do not do it if you have a slow connection.\nThe best speeds will be found around the\nhalf-life of a torrent, when the SLR will be at its highest.\n(The downside is that you will not be able to seed\nso much.\nIt's up to you to balance the pros and cons of this.)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Make yourself connectable</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nSee the <i>Why am I listed as not connectable?</i> &nbsp;section.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Limit your upload speed</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe upload speed affects the download speed in essentially two ways:<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Bittorrent peers tend to favour those other peers that upload to them.\nThis means that if A and B are leeching the same torrent and A is sending data to B at high speed then B will try to reciprocate.\nSo due to this effect high upload speeds lead to high download speeds.</li>\n<br>\n<li>Due to the way TCP works, when A is downloading something from B it has to keep telling B that it received the data sent to him.\n(These are called acknowledgements - ACKs -, a sort of \"got it!\" messages).\nIf A fails to do this then B will stop sending data and wait.\nIf A is uploading at full speed there may be no bandwidth left for the ACKs and they will be delayed.\nSo due to this effect excessively high upload speeds lead to low download speeds.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nThe full effect is a combination of the two.\nThe upload should be kept as high as possible while allowing the\nACKs to get through without delay.\n<b>A good thumb rule is keeping the upload at about 80% of the theoretical\nupload speed.</b> You will have to fine tune yours to find out what works best for you.\n(Remember that keeping the\nupload high has the additional benefit of helping with your ratio.) <br>\n<br>\nIf you are running more than one instance of a client it is the overall upload speed that you must take into account.\nSome clients (e.g.\nAzureus) limit global upload speed, others (e.g.\nShad0w's) do it on a per torrent basis.\nKnow your client.\nThe same applies if you are using your connection for anything else (e.g.\nbrowsing or ftp),\nalways think of the overall upload speed.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Limit the number of simultaneous connections</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nSome operating systems (like Windows 9x) do not deal well with a large number of connections, and may even crash.\nAlso some home routers (particularly when running NAT and/or firewall with stateful inspection services) tend to become\nslow or crash when having to deal with too many connections.\nThere are no fixed values for this, you may try 60 or 100\nand experiment with the value.\nNote that these numbers are additive, if you have two instances of\na client running the numbers add up.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Limit the number of simultaneous uploads</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nIsn't this the same as above? No.\nConnections limit the number of peers your client is talking to and/or\ndownloading from.\nUploads limit the number of peers your client is actually uploading to.\nThe ideal number is\ntypically much lower than the number of connections, and highly dependent on your (physical) connection.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Just give it some time</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nAs explained above peers favour other peers that upload to them.\nWhen you start leeching a new torrent you have\nnothing to offer to other peers and they will tend to ignore you.\nThis makes the starts slow, in particular if,\nby change, the peers you are connected to include few or no seeders.\nThe download speed should increase as soon\nas you have some pieces to share.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Why is my browsing so slow while leeching?</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nYour download speed is always finite.\nIf you are a peer in a fast torrent it will almost certainly saturate your download bandwidth, and your browsing will suffer.\nClients like uTorrent and Azureus provide the option to limit the download and upload speed.\nOr use a third-party solution, such as NetLimiter.\n<br>\n<br>\nBrowsing was used just as an example, the same would apply to gaming, IMing, etc...<br>\n<br>\n<br> My ISP uses a transparent proxy.\nWhat should I do? Short reply: change to an ISP that does not force a proxy upon you.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Why can't I use a proxy on your site?</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nIt is our policy not to allow new accounts to be opened from behind a proxy.\n<b>Any account found using a proxy to mask real ips (this includes TOR proxies) will be disabled and banned.</b>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br> Why can't I connect? Is the site blocking me? <br>\nYour failure to connect may be due to several reasons.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Maybe my address is blacklisted?</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe site blocks ips that have broken our rules, cheated, or have created multiple accounts.\nIf you're unlucky enough to assume the same ip as a banned user, there's nothing we can do.\nWe do not remove ip bans so don't ask.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Your ISP blocks the site's address</b>\n<br>\n<br>\n(In first place, it's unlikely your ISP is doing so.\nDNS name resolution and/or network problems are the usual culprits.)\nThere's nothing we can do.\nYou should contact your ISP (or get a new one).<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br> What if I can't find the answer to my problem here? <br>\nPost in the Forums, by all means.\nYou'll find they\nare usually a friendly and helpful place, provided you follow a few basic guidelines:<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure your problem is not really in this FAQ.\nThere's no point in posting just to be sent\nback here.\n</li>\n<li>Before posting read the sticky topics (the ones at the top).\nMany times new information that\nstill hasn't been incorporated in the FAQ can be found there.</li>\n<li>Help us in helping you.\nDo not just say \"it doesn't work!\".\nProvide details so that we don't\nhave to guess or waste time asking.\nWhat client do you use?
