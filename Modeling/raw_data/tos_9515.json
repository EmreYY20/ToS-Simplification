Coll., on archives and registries in conjunction with Sygic's registry plan apply to the storage of personal data that we process about you.\nAccording to the registry plan, we are obliged to keep registry records during the storage periods specified therein.</p>\nHow do we collect your personal data?\n<p>Generally, we collect your personal data directly from you (source), for example when you decide to download our app, make a purchase, register your account, use an additional service, which may also include to get a service provided jointly with a business partner fill-out marketing consent form, contact us or otherwise use our Services.\nProvision of personal data to us by you might happen directly, for example by filling-out registration, order or consent form but might also happen indirectly for example by using our apps which need to collect data in order to operate and in order to provide you with the Services requested.\nFor example, when using our navigation or localization apps, we must collect your precise location, speed and bearings.\nProvision of personal data by you is voluntary or presents either a requirement to enter into a contract or a contractual requirement (EULA).\nCertain processing of personal data might be required by law or required by us in order to pursue our own legitimate interests, as explained above.\nHowever, if you decide not to provide us your personal data in the first place, these additional statutory or legitimate interest provisions of data should not happen.</p>\n<p>In certain cases, we may receive your personal data from another person - for example, from a user which, decided to include you as an insured person in the insurance when joining the insurance, or which reported to us an insurance event that happened to you.\nHowever, if you, as a user, do not provide Sygic as with the necessary personal data, you will not be able to access to insurance and thus obtain the appropriate insurance protection (i.e.\nthe provision of personal data is necessary to access to insurance through us).\nIf you do not provide Sygic with the necessary personal data in connection with the reporting of an insurance event and / or the filing of a complaint after accessing to insurance, we will not be able to manage report the insurance event behalf you and / or file a complaint to the insurance company and arrange its resolution.</p>\nWho are recipients of your personal data?\n<p>We take the confidentiality of your personal data very seriously and have policies in place to ensure that your data is only

role and department of the particular employee.\nWe also use sub-contractors to support us in providing the Services who might process personal data for us.\nWe ensure that selection of our sub-contractors and any processing of personal data by them is compliant with the GDPR.\nCategories of recipients of your personal data are:<br>\n\u2022 Affiliated Sygic companies (eg.\nSygic Czech Republic, a.s.);<br>\n\u2022 Hosting or cloud services providers or related services to support the operation or operation of our applications and Services (e.g., Microsoft, Inc., Google, LLC, Apple,

Facebook Ireland, Ltd., Youtube LLC, Twitter, Inc., Microsoft (LinkedIn), Pinterest, Stack Overflow, Github, Tumblr, Dribble, Behance, Vimeo);<br>\n\u2022 Business partners, but only if you have ordered through our application a product or service that we provide together with a business partner (eg Union pois\u0165ov\u0148a, a.s.)<br>\n\u2022 Authorized personnel of the above, internal subcontractors as well as employees of the above recipients and suppliers</p>\n<p>In the past, we have also collected voluntary marketing consents behalf of third parties (partners) within our applications.\nThe list of these third parties has been removed from this privacy policy, as we terminated the consent-based projects as of December 31, 2020, and the contracts with these partners were terminated.</p>\nWhat countries do we transfer your personal data to?\n<p>By default, we seek not to transfer your personal data outside the EU and/or European Economic Area where not necessary.\nHowever, some of our sub-contractors or the above-mentioned recipients of personal data might be based or their servers might be located in the United States of America (U.S.) or in other country regarded as third party not ensuring adequate level of protection.\nAny transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area is done by us only under strict compliance with the GDPR.\nWe ensure the third-party recipients concluded EU model Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) with us or follow equivalent safeguards in place.</p>\nHow long we store your personal data?\n<p>We must not and we do not want to store your personal data for longer than necessary for the given purpose of processing.\nDue to this legal requirement but also due to technical and financial aspects of data storage we actively delete data where no longer necessary.\nIn general, storage periods of the following purposes are linked to active usage of our apps and the actual data on our product servers at the given time:<br>\n\u2022 Provision of the Services<br>\n\u2022 Development, improvement &amp.\ntesting<br>\n\u2022 Marketing analytics<br>\n\u2022 Statistics<br>\n\u2022 Security of personal data</p>\n<p>This means (in general) that if you stop using our app, we stop processing your personal data for the above purposes of processing.\nIf you uninstall our app, we delete personal data collected by the app.\nHowever, depending on the circumstances we delete some data sooner or later than that, for example:<br>\n\u2022 Data used for application improvement after 3 months<br>\n\u2022 Security and system logs are deleted after 1 year<br>\n\u2022 Back-ups for security purposes are deleted after 3 years</p>\n<p>Some of our users might have a life-time license for our apps.\nIn that case, we must store credentials of the license holder for a period equivalent to \u201clife-time\u201d period which is 90 years from license purchase.\nIf you request us to erase your personal data including your license credentials we can do so, but you will loose the life-time license as well (i.e.\nyou will no longer be in the list of license holders).\nPlease note that if you then decide to use our apps again in the future, you might not be able to rely on your license unless you prove to us that you had the license before.\nWe therefore suggest you keep evidence of our communication about the license credentials erasure.</p>\n<p>As regards the opportunity to access the insurance of the Union insurance company through our applications, we process the data obtained from the forms only for a period of 5 years from the termination of the insurance.</p>\n<p>As regards the purpose of direct marketing communications (newsletter &amp.\npush notifications), the storage period generally lasts until you revoke your consent (opt-out) or object against direct marketing.</p>\n<p>As regards Billing, Tax &amp.\nAccounting purposes the retention period are governed by local law and depending on the type of information or document in which billing personal data might be included the storage period is 10 years.</p>\n<p>It stems from the nature of social media profiles that we do not actively delete the history of our profiles, but you are free do so or request us to do so at any time.\nWe delete old private messages via social media once every 3 years.</p>\n<p>In general, storage periods for consumer contests is the duration of the contest.</p>\n<p>As regards handling user requests and legal enforcement, we might keep your personal data if we believe it might be necessary for us in court, criminal or administrative proceedings in the future.\nGeneral limitation period under Slovak law is 3 years.</p>\n<p>We process personal data within whistleblowing until
