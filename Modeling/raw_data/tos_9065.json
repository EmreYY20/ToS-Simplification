and use of personal data and specifically to any of our publicly available devices, websites or digital applications (\u201capps\u201d) that link to this policy.\nThis policy also applies to any of our non-public systems used by partners, applicants, and employees.</p>\n<p>\n<b>We also specifically address Tracking Technology used for Advertising, Data Sharing, and Data

cases, the terms may include information that identifies a household.\nAn identifiable person is an individual who can be singled out by using information such as their name, address, or telephone number.\nFor example, Ms.\nCindy Delgado who lives at 123 Scripps Street with a telephone number of 513-513-5133 is an identifiable person.\nCindy\u2019s name, address, telephone number, and even her choice of pronoun are examples of her personal data.</p>\n<b>What's not covered in this policy?</b>\n<p>Products and services provided by any other company are not covered by this policy.\nIn some

scanning a QR code, using our apps, visiting our websites, viewing our content on a smartphone, a computer, a smart or connected television, or digital media players such as Roku or Amazon Fire.\nWhen you use a device or a service made by someone else to view our content, your interaction with that device or service is likely governed by that provider\u2019s privacy policy.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Personal data we obtain from other sources</b>\n</p>\n<p>We may receive personal data about you from third parties such as advertising partners, marketing agencies, market research companies, our suppliers, contractors and consultants, group companies, publicly available websites (such as LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter) and public agencies.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Sensitive categories of personal data</b>\n</p>\n<p>In limited circumstances, personal data that you provide us may fall into sensitive categories such as information about your physical and mental health, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origin, veteran status, political opinions, philosophical belief, trade union membership and biometric data.\nUnless required by law (such as COVID-19 testing or some employment related information), providing these categories of personal data will always be your choice.</p>\n<p>We take extra precautions with personal data in sensitive categories in order to minimize its collection, limit access to it, protect it, and whether and with whom we share it.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Why We Collect Personal Data</b>[Back to Top] <p>\n<b>\n</b>Like all companies, we use the personal data we collect in multiple ways.\nExamples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To allow you to access our website and apps.</li>\n<li>To receive and respond to questions from you about our products and

participate in contests or surveys.</li>\n<li>To store information about your preferences and to allow us to customize our websites and apps according to your individual interests.</li>\n<li>To carry out the purchases you have requested.</li>\n<li>To enable advertising on our websites and apps.</li>\n<li>To allow us to enter into and comply with contractual arrangements.</li>\n<li>To process job applications.</li>\n<li>To conform with the requirements of the law or legal process.</li>\n<li>To protect or defend your rights, our rights, or the rights of other users.</li>\n<li>To protect the

benefits, and conduct performance reviews for our employees</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may use your personal data to send you certain mandatory service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues, security warnings, software updates, and other support announcements.\nIf you choose to receive promotional materials from us (including email), we may use your personal data to confirm that choice and to promote and market products, services, and special offers from us or others.</p>\n<p>In certain instances, we may provide you with the option to set your preferences for receiving email communications from us.\nthat is, to agree to some communications but not others.\nYou may choose to stop receiving future commercial email communications from us by clicking the \"unsubscribe\" link included at the bottom of most emails we send, or by contacting us directly.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Legal Basis For Using Your Personal Data</b>[Back to Top] <p>Some jurisdictions require that we have a legal basis for collecting and processing your personal data.\nWhere that is required, we consider those legal bases to be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To perform our obligations under a contract with you.</li>\n<li>To comply with our legal obligations.\n</li>\n<li>For our legitimate interests and the legitimate interests of others which include:</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Fulfilling our mission of providing impactful journalism and serving our communities</li>\n<li>The running and growing of our business for our shareholders.</li>\n<li>Delivering our content to our viewers via broadcast, our websites, and apps.\n</li>\n<li>Identifying and selecting qualified suppliers and partners.</li>\n<li>Conducting market research and business development.</li>\n</ul>\n<li>In the cases where you choose to provide us your personal data via one of our websites or apps, we process your personal data, at least in part, on the basis of your consent.\nYou may withdraw this consent at any time by contacting us.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where we are relying on our (or another person\u2019s) legitimate interests, we will always consider the categories or types of personal data in question in order to balance our use against the possibility of any action that might be counter to your rights.\nWe will never purposefully violate the rights you have in your personal data and ask that you please contact us with any concerns.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Data We Share and Who We Share It With</b>[Back to Top] <p>In order to meet the \u2018why\u2019s\u2019 of Why We Collect Personal Data discussed above, we may share the personal data we collect with the categories of organizations listed below.\nIn selecting the third parties that we employ, we carefully consider the service they provide, the categories of personal data concerned, and the protections and governance we are able to put in place.\nThe third parties with whom we share your personal information are always subject to privacy and security obligations consistent with this privacy policy and applicable laws.</p>\n<p>\n<b>The categories of organizations with whom we share personal data are:</b>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our partners and service providers that perform professional services, technical services or handle transactions on our behalf.\n</li>\n<li>Our advertisers, advertising- and marketing-related services providers and partners as well as companies that help us learn how you and others interact with our

our business, we may sell or purchase assets.\nIf another entity acquires us or one of our brands, any related personal data may be transferred to and used by this acquiring entity.\nWe will, however, take reasonable steps to ensure that your preferences are followed.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Data Transfer</b>[Back to Top] <p>We have offices in the United States and Canada and the management of our brands is located largely at the headquarters our parent company in Cincinnati, Ohio.</p>\n<p>\n<b>By visiting and using our products and services the personal data you share with us or that we collect automatically will be collected, stored, processed, or transferred in and to the United States where our technical infrastructure is located and operated.\nSome of our brands and service providers may have operations in other countries as well.</b>\n</p>\n<p>In addition to the Risks listed in the Storage, Risk and Security Section, the data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries where your personal data may be collected, stored, or processed might not be as comprehensive as those in your country.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Your Rights</b>[Back to Top] <p>Your rights related to your personal data may vary by where you live or are located.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Your rights may include:</b>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The right to be informed of what personal

a complaint with the competent authority.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We encourage you to research and understand your rights relative to your personal data and recommend the following links as good sources of information.\nWe will never discriminate against anyone for exercising their rights or inquiring about their personal data.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>California Consumer Privacy Act</li>\n<li>General Data Protection Regulation</li>\n<li>United Kingdom Information Commissioner\u2019s Office</li>\n<li>Irish Data Protection Commission</li>\n<li>Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada</li>\n<li>The International Association of Privacy Professionals</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Storage, Risks and Security</b>[Back to Top] <p>The risk to the personal data in our care is that, despite our security precautions, it may be lost, stolen or misused.\n</p>\n<p>Although we take steps to protect the personal data which you provide to us, the transmission of information over the internet is never completely secure.\nWe cannot guarantee the security of your personal data while in transit to us.\nOnce we have received your personal data, our security team will use industry standard procedures and security features to secure it.</p>\n<p>We keep your personal data for no longer than we need it to meet the \u2018why\u2019 of Why We Collect Personal Data or as long as we have another valid reason to keep it (the Legal Basis discussed above).\nIf you have an account with us, you may delete it or request that it be deleted at any time.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Tracking Technology and Interest Based Advertising</b>[Back to Top] <p>Our products and services use tracking technology in order to allow us to offer you a more personalized experience and to enable interest-based advertising.\nWe enable third parties such as advertising partners and analysis firms to collect information through tracking technology.\nThe information collected through this tracking technology may be considered personal data.</p>\n<p>Where we use tracking technology, you may block the technology or opt out of certain advertisements.\nTo do so, you can activate the setting on your device that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some tracking technology.\nwe have provided some helpful links below for various devices and

technology, you may not be able to access all or parts of our websites or apps or use all the available functionality.</p>\n<p>The website www.aboutads.info provides another option to opt-out of advertisements.\nIt is important to note, the opt-out tool applies only to the device and browser you are using to opt out.\nTherefore, if you use a different device, change web browsers or clear or change settings, you will need to perform the opt-out task again.\nPlease be aware that opting out of a network advertising service does not mean that you will not receive online ads.\nIt only means that the network from which you opted out should no longer deliver ads tailored to your preferences and interests.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Additional information and opt-out tools:</b>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How

advertising purposes (\u201cDNT Notice\u201d).\nUnfortunately, given how preference-based advertising works, DNT Notices may not be effective in communicating your preferences and we do not take any action based on browser based DNT Notices.\nThe best course of action, if you do not wish to participate in interest-based advertising activities, is to follow the directions given above.</p>\n<p>Lastly, should you receive marketing or promotional emails from us that you no longer wish to receive, please click the \u201cUnsubscribe\u201d link in our emails, contact us directly,

information via Tracking Technology that may be considered personal data with and by our advertising partners.\nOn our websites and apps that are available to a national audience or specifically to California consumers, you will find a link entitled <u>Do Not Sell My Personal Information</u> that, in addition to the methods described above, will allow you to opt out of this Tracking Technology.\nPlease contact us with any questions.\n</p>\n<p>Find out more about our obligations and your rights at the following link, California Consumer Privacy

resolve any dispute raised under the previous provision, the dispute may be submitted to arbitration consistent with this Section.\nThe parties understand that they would have had a right or

third parties who are not signatories to this agreement, whether related to this agreement or otherwise, including past, present, and future claims and disputes, and including any dispute as to the

NO CLASS ACTION restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement to arbitrate does not apply and the classwide dispute must be brought in court.<br>\n<br>15.\nNO CLASS ACTIONS<br>\n<br>TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, COMPANY AND YOU EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES ON A CLASSWIDE BASIS.\nTHAT IS, TO EITHER JOIN A CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR

Use or Additional Terms will be effective immediately upon notice, either by posting on the Services or by notification by email or conventional mail.\nIt is your responsibility to review the Terms of Use and the Services from time to time for any changes or Additional Terms.\nYour access and use of any the Services following any modification of these Terms of Use or the provision of Additional Terms will signify your assent to and acceptance of the same.\nIf you object to any subsequent revision to the Terms of Use or to any Additional Terms, immediately discontinue use of the Services and, if applicable, terminate your Membership.<br>\n<br>18.\nMISCELLANEOUS<br>\n<br>(A) No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.\nThe section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall not be given any legal import.<br>\n<br>(B) Except where specifically stated otherwise (e.g., the \u201cException to Arbitrate\u201d provision above), if any part of these Terms of Use is unlawful or unenforceable for any reason, we both agree that only that part of the Terms of Use shall be
