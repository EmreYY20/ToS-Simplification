account is open ,with a positive balance and is in good standing.For purposes of this section, your primary ,deposit accountis in \u201cgood standing\u201d if it is not blocked or suspended for fraud or any ,other reason.There is no requirement to maintain a balance in a Vaultand there is no ,minimum deposit required to earn the stated APY(as defined below).Additionally, there,are no fees associated with the creation or maintenance of a Vault.\nYou may close a Vault ,at any time, but you must first transfer any money in the Vault to your primary deposit ,accountbefore doing so.\nAccess to your Savings Accountis only available through our ,Mobile App.,b.Good Standing.\nNegative Balances.If your primary deposit account issuspended, blocked,,orclosed, your Vaults will not earnor be paidinterest.\nHowever, if yourprimary deposit ,account is suspendedor blockedduring a calendar quarter,and that suspension or block is ,subsequently lifted before the end of the calendar quarter, your Vaults will earnandbepaid ,interest for that calendar quarter in accordance with Section 7.d.below.The Available ,Balance(as defined below)of your Accountdoes not include money in your Vaults.\n,Without limiting any other right or remedy that we may have under this Agreement or ,otherwise, money in your Vaults may be used by us to cure a negative balance in your ,primary deposit accountor asotherwise provided in Section 14.r.titled \u201cSecurity Interest ,&amp.\nSetoff\u201d.\nAs such, if you have a negative balance in your primary deposit account, as a ,result of Account fees, overdrafts, or any other reason, and you transfer money from a ,Vault to your primary deposit account, we will first apply the money you transfer from the ,Vault to the negative balance in your primary deposit account.We will not use funds in ,your Vaults, however, to prevent an overdraft of your primary deposit account.\nTherefore, ,if you have opted in to and are eligible for Overdraft Protection, you may incur overdraft ,fees if you overdraw your primary deposit account even if you have funds in your Vaults.,c.Transfers.\nTransfer Limitations.You can only transfer money to and from a Vault through ,your primary deposit account.\nYou cannot otherwise spend, withdraw, transfer, or access ,money in a Vault, and you cannot directly transfer money between Vaults.\nWhen you want ,to access money in a Vault, you must first transfer the money to your primary deposit ,account.\nTransfers between your primary deposit accountand a Vault can be conducted ,only through the Mobile App.\nwe do not accept transfer instructions over the phone or by ,any other means.\nOnceyou instruct us to transfer money from your primary deposit account ,to a Vault, that money will be unavailable for you to otherwise spend, withdraw,transfer, ,or accessfrom your primary deposit account.\nAlthough, theAvailable Balance of your ,Account does not include money in your Vaults, the money in your Vaults is counted for ,purposes of the maximumAccount balance limit in Section 6titled \u201cLimits on Your ,Account\u201d.\nFor securityreasons, we may impose limits on the numbers of transfers between ,your primary deposit accountand your Vaults in oursole discretion.Notwithstanding ,anything to the contrary in this Agreement, for all funds in a Vault, we reserve the right at ,any time to require at least seven days\u2019 written notice of an intended transfer to your ,primary deposit account.,13,d.Interest.\nThe current rate at which interest may be paid on the Vaults, and the corresponding ,annual percentage yield (\u201cAPY\u201d), can be found in the Vault feature in the Mobile App.\nOn ,a quarterly basis, interest will be calculated and separately credited to each open Vault on,the Interest Payout Date (as defined below), subject to the terms of this Section 7.\nInterest ,for each Vault is calculated by:(i) applying the current interest rate to the average daily ,balance across all of your Vaults for the calendar quarter, subject to the maximum average ,daily balance limit specified below, and (ii) multiplying the amount in clause (i) by the ,average daily balance in the applicable Vault for the calendar quarter divided by the ,average daily balance across all Vaults for the calendar quarter.\nThe average daily balance ,of aVault for a calendar quarter is calculated by adding together the balancesin the Vault ,for every day the Vault is open during the calendar quarter and dividing that amount by the ,number of days in the calendar quarter.\nIn the event your primary deposit account is ,suspended or blocked, and that suspension or block is subsequently lifted during the same ,calendar quarter, the average daily balance of a Vault for that calendar quarter is calculated ,by adding together the balancesin the Vault for every day the primary deposit account is ,not blocked or suspendedduring the calendar quarter and dividing that amount by the ,number of days in the calendar quarter.\nInterest will be calculated on a maximum ,average daily balance, aggregated across all of your Vaults, of $5,000.\nYou will not ,earn interest on any average daily balance that exceeds $5,000 across all of your ,Vaults.\nWe may, at our discretion, change the interest rate, and the corresponding ,APY, at any time.If we change the interest rate, and the corresponding APY, such change ,will take effect on the first day of the next calendar quarter.\nWe will credit interest in whole ,cents, after rounding to the nearest cent,to the applicable Vault upon the start of the first ,monthly statement period following the end of the calendar quarter (\u201cInterest Payout ,Date\u201d).\nBecause interest is credited to your Vaults only after each calendar quarter ends, ,the amount of accrued interest is not added to the daily balance of yourVaults during the ,calendar quarter.\nThat means that accrued interest does not compound prior to being ,credited to your Vaults.\nIf a Vault is closedprior tothe end of the calendar quarter or ,the Interest Payout Date, interest will not be credited to the Vault for the calendar ,quarter.,e.Taxes,i.General.\nYou areresponsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all ,taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with the interest paid ,on yourVaults, as applicable.\n,ii.Backup Withholding.We may ask you to certify your name and social security ,number to avoid potential backup withholding and to report interest income paid ,to you in connection with the Vaults.\nIn addition, we may also ask you to certify ,that you are not subject to backup withholding.\nIf the Internal Revenue Service ,(\u201cIRS\u201d) notifies us that we do not have a correct social security number for you, ,we may be required to withhold and remit to the IRS a percentage of interest paid ,to your Vaults.,14,8.Electronic Fund Transfers.\nOther Rights

Percentage Rateby ,365 (or by 366 in a leap year).The current DailyPeriodic Rate is 0.074%.To get the Average Daily ,Balance of Purchases, we take the beginning balance of Purchases on yourCard Accounteach day;,and subtract unpaid interest or other finance charges and any payments or credits and fees(New ,Purchases are not included in the calculation of the Average Daily Balance of Purchases for the ,Billing C ycle in which those Purchases are made).This gives us the Daily Balance of Purchases.\n,Then we add together all of these Daily Balances of Purchases for the Billing Cycle, and divide the ,total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle.\nThis gives us the Average Daily Balance of ,Purchases.,(b)How WeCalculate Your Interest on Cash Advances: Average Daily Balance Method (Including ,New Cash Advances).We calculate a portion of the interest charge on yourCard Accountby ,applying a Daily Periodic Rate to the \u201cAverage Daily Balance of Cash Advances(including New

0.074%.To ,get the Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances, we take the beginning balance of Cash Advances ,on theCard Accounteach day.\nadd any new Cash Advances that have a transaction date that ,occurredon that day.\nand subtract unpaid interest or other finance charges and any payments or ,credits and fees.This gives us the Daily Balance of Cash Advances.\nThen we add together all of ,these Daily Balances of Cash Advances for the Billing Cycle, and divide the total by the number of ,days in the Billing Cycle.\nThis gives us the Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances.,(c)Calculation of Interest Charges.We calculate a portion of your interest charge by multiplying a ,DailyPeriodic Rate by your Average Daily Balance of Purchases(excluding New Purchases), and ,by multiplying a Daily Periodic Rate by your Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances (including ,new Cash Advances).\nWe add together the results of these daily calculations to get your total ,interest charge for the Billing
