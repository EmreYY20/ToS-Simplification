ability to delete any Browser Activity within 24 hours of such Browser Activity being collected by the Surf Extension (the \u201c<strong>Data Deletion Period</strong>\u201d).\nIn the event you do not delete the Browser Activity within the Data Deletion Period, you will still be able to delete such Browser Activity in bulk within 30 days after which time the data is aggregated or de-identified so

may be earned per week from browsing.\nThe Rewards Program works on a rolling basis, where browsing related points for missed days can be earned retroactively, up to the daily and weekly maximums.<br>\n<br>From time to time, we may offer other ways to earn points, including through hitting certain achievements (e.g., browsing x amount of unique links, having used the extension for y hours, wish listing z items.) or participating in promotional programs.<br>\u200d<br>Points accrued are non-transferable to other members or accounts and have no cash or monetary value.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How Do I Redeem Points?<br>Points are redeemable for gift cards or specific products posted on joinsurf.com.\nA redeemed product will be provided in the form of a

accumulated points in your Rewards Program account will expire if your account has neither earned nor redeemed any points in the previous 10 years.<br>\n<br>If the Rewards Program terminates, members will no longer be able to earn points but will have 10 years from the effective date of termination to use any accumulated points, after which time the points will automatically expire.\nIf your membership is cancelled, revoked or otherwise terminated, any points in your account will expire upon the effective date of account termination.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What if I Refer a Friend to the
