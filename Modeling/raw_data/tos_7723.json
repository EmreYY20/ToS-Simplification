Collection</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>RoboKiller</strong>.\nUsers of RoboKiller Premium have the option to turn 'on' call screening within the RoboKiller App.\nOnce this feature is activated, when an unknown contact calls that RoboKiller user, that unknown caller will be asked to state their name and the purpose for their call via an automated call screening prompt.\nThe response of the caller is recorded and an automated transcript of the recording is sent to the RoboKiller user.\nAs a result, we may collect ancillary information from non-users of our products, such as those who

Recording (ACR) feature, we may collect the number of the end-call recipient in order to complete the call.\nThe purpose for this processing is to allow a TapeACall user's number to appear for the call recipient (so that the call recipient knows who is calling them).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>RoboKiller Spam Call Matching</strong>\n</p>\n<p>RoboKiller aims to reduce and prevent robocalls and other spam calls to our users.\nWe do this by prompting a spam caller to play its automated message before the call reaches our users.\nWe quickly analyse the automated message and match it with our database of spam calls.\nWhere we detect a spam call, we will screen the call for our users and send the user a notification that the call was screened.\nThis feature is only available to RoboKiller Premium users.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information collected from service providers and integrated services.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may obtain information, including personal information from third parties

agree to those third parties' privacy policies and terms of use.<br>\n<br>If you choose to communicate with us or another user through social features available on our websites (including lookup.robokiller.com) or mobile applications or through our social media pages, or other similar communication or messaging features or services, such information may be made publicly

obligation or unless we have an overriding interest to retain it;</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Portability</strong>: in certain circumstances, exercise the right to data portability (this is a right to obtain a transferable version of your personal information to transfer to another provider).\nand</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Consent Management</strong>: where we rely on consent to process your personal data, you may withdraw consent at any time.\nYou do not have to provide a reason for your withdrawal where processing is based on consent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are a resident of the EEA and you wish to access, change, or delete the personal information we hold about you, you may contact us here.\nIf we change or delete your personal information or if you decline to actively share certain personal information with us, we may not be able to provide you with our Services or some of the features and functionality of our Services.\nKeep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on the rights and freedoms of another person.\nFor example, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our Services to you anymore.<br>\n<br>For your protection, we may require proof of identity and verification before we can answer the above requests.<br>\u200d</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Legal basis for processing data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In this section, we identify the legal grounds on which we rely to process personal information.<br>\n<br>In some cases, we have a legitimate interest to process the personal information that we collect, such as to develop, administer and support our products and services.\nto operate, evaluate and improve our business.\nto facilitate and manage engagement programs.\nto promote research.\nto support our recruitment activities.\nor to facilitate a Corporate Transaction (including a sale of assets or merger or acquisition).<br>\n<br>In other cases, we process personal information to fulfill our contracts with business partners, such as third parties that distribute our products.<br>\n<br>It may also be necessary for us to process personal information to establish, exercise or defend against fraud, illegal activity, and claims and other liabilities, including by enforcing the terms and conditions that govern the services we provide.<br>\n<br>Our processing of certain information may be necessary to comply with our legal obligations and for reasons of public interest, such as with respect to adverse events and product safety reporting.<br>\n<br>We may also process personal information as specifically permitted by applicable legal requirements.<br>\n<br>If we rely on consent for the processing of your personal information, we will seek such consent at the time we collect your personal information.<br>\u200d</p>\n<p>\n<strong>International data transfers</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may transfer your personal information to countries other than the country in which the data was originally collected for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice.\nThe countries to which we transfer personal information may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information.\nWhen we transfer personal information across borders, we consider a variety of requirements that may apply to such transfers.<br>\n<br>Specifically, we may transfer personal information from the European Economic Area to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Countries that the European Commission has deemed to adequately safeguard personal information,</li>\n<li>Pursuant to the recipient's compliance with standard contractual clauses (also known as Model Clauses), or Binding Corporate Rules,</li>\n<li>Pursuant to the consent of the individual to whom the personal information pertains, or</li>\n<li>As otherwise permitted by applicable EEA requirements.</li>\n</ul>8.\nInformation for Residents of California: Your California Privacy Rights<p>If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"<strong>CCPA</strong>\") may provide you with notice and other rights regarding our use of your personal information that is in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.\nThe CCPA Notice applies to \"Consumers\" as defined by the law.\nThis section describes your CCPA rights as a California Consumer and explains how to exercise those rights.\nSee Sections 1 - 4 above to learn what information we collect from you and how it is collected, used, and shared.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Access to Information and Data Portability Rights</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to send us a request, no more than twice in a twelve (12) - month period, for any of the following for the period that is twelve months prior to the request date:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The categories of personal information we have collected about you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The categories of sources from which we collected your personal information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The business or commercial purposes for our collecting or selling your personal information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The categories of third parties to whom we have shared your personal information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A list of the categories of personal information disclosed for a business purpose in the prior twelve (12) months, or that no disclosure occurred.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A list of the categories of personal information sold about you in the prior twelve (12) months, or that no sale occurred.\nIf we sell your personal information, we will explain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The categories of your personal information we have sold.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The categories of third parties to which we sold personal information, by categories of personal information sold for each third party.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You have the right to make or obtain a transportable copy, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, of your personal information that we have collected in the period that is twelve (12) months prior to the request date and are maintaining.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Deletion Rights</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Except to the extent we have a basis for retention under CCPA, you may request that we delete your personal information that we have collected directly from you and are maintaining.\nNote also that we are not required to delete your personal information that we did not collect directly from you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Exercising Your Rights</strong>\n</p>\n<p>To make a request for access, portability, or deletion according to your rights under CCPA, click <strong>here</strong> or mail your request to Teltech Systems, Inc., 555 W 18th Street, New York, New York, Attention: Legal Department.\nCalifornia Consumers may exercise these rights via an authorized agent who meets the agency requirements of the CCPA.\nWe cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you.\nAny request you submit to us is subject to an identification and residency verification process (\"Verifiable Consumer Request\").<br>\n<br>The Verifiable Consumer Request must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.\nYou agree that in order to accommodate certain requests by you, we may require you to verify your ownership of an account by responding to a text message sent to the phone number on the account and/or by requesting reasonable documentation to show your ownership of the number and account.</li>\n<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some personal information we maintain about Consumers is not sufficiently associated with enough personal information about the Consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular Consumer's personal information (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID).\nAs required by the CCPA, we do not include that personal information in response to Verifiable Consumer Requests.\nIf we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response.<br>\n<br>We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify Consumer personal information that we collect, process, store, disclose, and otherwise use and to respond to your California Consumer privacy rights requests.\nWe will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests, but we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome.<br>\n<br>We do not knowingly \"sell\" personal information that we collect from you, in accordance with the definition of \"sell\" in the CCPA, and will treat personal information we collect from you as subject to a do not sell request.\nThere is not yet a consensus as to whether our use of certain tracking technologies may constitute a \"sale\" of your PI as defined by the CCPA.\nSee Section 9 <em>Online Privacy Choices and Rights</em> to learn more about the choices that are available to you.<br>\n<br>We will not discriminate against you in a manner prohibited by the CCPA because you exercise your CCPA rights.\nHowever, we may charge a different price or rate, or offer a different level or quality of good or service, to the extent that doing so is reasonably related to the value of the applicable data.\nIn addition, we may offer you financial incentives for the collection, sale, and retention and use of your personal information as permitted by the CCPA that can, without limitation, result in reasonably different prices, rates, or quality levels.\nThe material aspects of any financial incentive will be explained and described in its program terms.\nWe may add or change incentive programs and/or their terms by posting a notice on the program descriptions and terms linked to above so check them regularly.<br>\n<br>California's \"Shine the Light\" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes.\nWe do not currently engage in the type of sharing covered by that law and so no such list exists.\nWe do not make any representations concerning third parties that do not collect personal information directly through our Services.<br>\n<br>To find out more about our \"do not track\" practices under Cal.\nBus.\n&amp.\nProf.\nCode \u00c2\u00a7 22575, see the \"Do Not Track Disclosures\" section of this Privacy Policy.\nFor information about additional choices available to

otherwise modify the nature or frequency of promotional communications you receive from us, it may take up to ten business days for us to process your request, and you may receive promotional communications from us that you have opted-out from during that period.\nAdditionally, even after you opt-out from receiving commercial messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional or

information\" (as defined under Nevada law) collected by operators of websites or online services.\nWe currently do not sell covered information, as \"sale\" is defined by Nevada law, and we do not have plans to sell this information.\nHowever, if you would like to be notified if we decide in the future to sell personal information covered by the Act, please contact us at the appropriate email in the \"How to Contact Us\" section of this Privacy Policy.\nYou are responsible for updating any change in your email address by the same method and we are not obligated to cross-reference other

Transfers</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our Services are hosted in the United States.\nIf you choose to use our Services from outside the United States, with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from United States law, note that you are transferring your personal information outside of those regions to the United States for storage and processing.\nWe may transfer your data from the United States to other countries in connection with the storage and processing of data to operate our business.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>TapeACall China Users</strong>\n</p>\n<p>For TapeACall users, we

our ads on other websites and mobile applications may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance's (\"DAA\") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.\nTo learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising on the websites and mobile applications that you visit and use, including use of Cross-device Data for serving ads, visit

you have ceased using our Services or for so long as we have a legitimate business need for the information or to fulfill any legal and regulatory obligations.\nWe may retain other information that is

provide information to us at your own risk.<br>\n<br>If you correspond with us by email, text message, or using Web forms like a \"contact us\" feature available through our Services, you should be

support@switchupapp.zendesk.com</p>\n<strong>\n<br>SERVICE-SPECIFIC TERMS</strong>\n<p>Additional service-specific terms apply to the following Services:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\n<br>RoboKiller</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>General</strong>.\nRoboKiller offers among other things, the ability to automatically block nuisance calls (robocalls, telemarketers, etc.), to forward nuisance calls to an Answer Bot selected by you or a default voicemail greeting, record and transcribe them, to blacklist and whitelist specific numbers and, if enabled, to block SMS spam messages.\nRoboKiller also offers automated call screening assistance.\nWhen an unrecognized number calls that is not (i) a contact, (ii) on your whitelist, or (iii) not clearly identified as spam, the automated call screening assistance feature will prompt the caller to state a name and purpose for the call, all of which is recorded, transcribed, and made available for your review.\nAndroid users will actively need to enable this feature.\niOS users can disable this feature in the RoboKiller\u2019s settings.\nCertain features may not be available in earlier versions of the application or on Android devices.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Plans.\n</strong>RoboKiller offers a free plan (\u201c<strong>RK Free</strong>\u201d) and a premium plan (\u201c<strong>RK Premium</strong>\u201d).\nWhile both RK Free and RK Premium Users have access to basic features, RK Premium subscribers have several additional features available to them such as call blocking, spam text protection, personal block lists, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Functionality</strong>.\nRoboKiller uses a combination of telephone carrier network (\u201c<strong>PSTN</strong>\u201d) and Voice over IP (\u201c<strong>VoIP</strong>\u201d) to deliver calls to your Device.\nThe technology and how calls are received on your Device are determined by your telephone carrier and the version of the operating system your Device is running when RoboKiller is set up.\nIf you upgrade your operating system version, it is recommended that you disable/deprogram your Device, uninstall, and reinstall RoboKiller to ensure you have the best experience.\nInstructions on how to disable/re-program RoboKiller can be found&nbsp.\nin the settings menu of the App.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Call Blocking/Forwarding</strong>.\nActivating the call blocking/forwarding feature means that certain incoming calls (e.g.\ndeclined calls, silenced calls or unanswered calls) are forwarded to RoboKiller in order to identify and block nuisance and unwanted calls accordingly (or send them back to your Device as a safe call - all before your phone rings).\nCalls from your Device\u2019s contacts go directly to your Device.\nWhen you dial the number provided to you during the setup process, a message will appear to inform you that calls will not be forwarded to that number.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please note that you are solely responsible for any charges imposed by your mobile service provider for (i) using the call forwarding feature, (ii) local or long distance usage, and (iii) text message and data usage.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Number Monitoring</strong>.\n&nbsp;You agree to check the numbers and messages from blocked calls on your Device regularly to ensure that you whitelist any legitimate phone number so that it will not be blocked in the future.\nThe Service also provides you the ability to create and modify a personal whitelist (\"<strong>Allow List</strong>\") and blacklist (\"<strong>Block List</strong>\").\nYou can use the whitelist feature to ensure that a specific number is never blocked.\nYou can add or remove users from your personal Allow List and Block List at any time.\nPlease note that if you have requested a call from, or have an existing relationship with a debt relief company, collections company or if you provided your number to authorize a sales call to any company and you desire to continue receiving those calls, we advise you to add the number to your contacts or Allow List and to monitor your RoboKiller messages for calls you may wish to return.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Access to Microphone</strong>.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;When you download RoboKiller and begin the setup and activation process, RoboKiller will ask permission to access your Device\u2019s microphone.\nYou must give RoboKiller permission to access your Device\u2019s microphone in order for the App to properly function.\nThe Service uses your Device\u2019s microphone to ensure you can talk to the caller when RoboKiller initiates a VoIP call with a safe caller.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Access to Contacts</strong>.\nIn order to provide the Services, RoboKiller must access the numbers in your Device\u2019s address book.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Answer Bots</strong>.\nRoboKiller provides you the option to use its Answer Bots to respond to unwanted spam and robocallers.\nAnswer Bots are pre-recorded audio messages.\nYou can choose whichever Answer Bot you like or make your own audio content and recordings (\u201c<strong>Audio(s)</strong>\u201d).\nIf you choose not to use Answer Bots, unwanted spam and robocallers will hear a very polite but concise default recording.\nWhen unwanted spam and robocaller engages with one of RoboKiller\u2019s Answer Bots, the conversation is recorded as a voicemail and saved within the App (\u201c<strong>Answer Bot Recording''</strong>).\nBy using RoboKiller\u2019s Answer Bot feature, you expressly authorize us to record Answer Bot conversations on your behalf.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>RoboKiller provides Users the ability to share your Audios and Answer Bot Recordings as set forth herein.\nFor every Audio and/or Answer Bot Recording that you decide to share, you represent and warrant that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you will share Audio and/or Answer Bot Recordings strictly from unsolicited, unwanted spam and robocallers and you will not share any Audio and/or Answer Bot Recordings from people with whom you have established a relationship with (e.g., signing up to receive offers);</li>\n<li>to the extent there is an identifiable person mentioned in your Audio and/or the Answer Bot Recording, you have obtained the appropriate rights, permissions and/or licenses from such person in order to share the Answer Bot Recording;</li>\n<li>Teltech will not need to obtain any rights, permissions and/or licenses from any third-party or pay royalties to any third-party in order to make the Audio and/or Answer Bot Recording publically available;</li>\n<li>the Audio and/or Answer Bot Recording do not infringe any third-party\u2019s rights, including intellectual property rights and privacy rights.\nand</li>\n<li>the Audio and/or Answer Bot Recording comply with this Agreement, all applicable laws as well as the terms of use of any Social Media platform or application.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>RoboKiller also provides Users the ability to share their own unique Answer Bot Audio creations with RoboKiller either directly within the App or via email.\nAs between you and Teltech, you own the Audios that you create and submit to RoboKiller.\nBy submitting your Audios, you grant Teltech and its affiliates, a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license and right to copy, transmit, distribute, publicly perform and display (through all media now known or hereinafter created) and make derivative works from your Audios for the purpose of: (i) making the Audios available for review by Teltech.\n(ii) providing the Audios on Social Media and other platforms.\n(iii) allowing other RoboKiller Users to play, download and use your Audios within the App.\n(iv) promoting RoboKiller\u2019s Answer Bots, provided you have made your Audios publicly available.\nand (v) archiving or preserving the Audios for disputes, legal proceedings, or investigations.\nYou further grant all RoboKiller Users the ability to view your Audios for personal, non-commercial purposes.\nThis includes the right to copy and make derivative works from the Audios solely to the extent necessary to view the Audios.\nThe aforementioned licenses will continue unless and until you remove your Audios from the App, in which case the licenses will terminate within a commercially reasonable time.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the license for legal archival/preservation purposes will continue indefinitely.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For every Audio you create and upload, post or transmit to RoboKiller, you represent and warrant that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you have the right to submit the Audios to RoboKiller and grant the licenses set forth herein;</li>\n<li>your Audio is civil and respectful;</li>\n<li>your Audio does not contain any sexually explicit content or pornography;</li>\n<li>the Audio does not contain hateful, defamatory, or discriminatory content or incites hatred against any individual or group;</li>\n<li>your Audio does not harm or exploit minors;</li>\n<li>your Audio does not discuss unlawful acts or extreme violence.\nand</li>\n<li>the Audio does not promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Legal Compliance</strong>.\nDepending on the state or country in which you are located, the Answer Bot recording may violate laws requiring a person to obtain the consent of other parties on the call prior to recording the telephone conversation.\nYou acknowledge and agree that as the individual directing the recording, you are solely responsible for determining the law in the state or country in which you are receiving calls prior to using the Answer Bot feature in that state or country.\nYou agree not to enable the Answer Bot feature unless you have first determined that your use is legal.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Voicemail and Call Screening Transcriptions</strong>.\nYour version of RoboKiller may include transcription capabilities available for your use.\nShould you decide to deploy the transcription features, you acknowledge and expressly agree that Teltech may transcribe or have transcribed by a third party and store or have stored by a third party, voicemail messages and call screening recording, and to make such transcriptions available to you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Audio Fingerprinting</strong>.\nRoboKiller may extract relevant features in the first few seconds of an incoming call made to your Device.\nRoboKiller is then able to identify an audio sample or rapidly match other similar features in an existing audio database in order to determine whether such incoming call is a robocall.\nThis process proactively analyzes an audio sample within a call and is done moments before RoboKiller alerts you of the nature of the call.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Call Data Retention</strong>.\nWe make no guarantees that we will retain certain call data such as calls, call recordings, voicemail, call screens, Answer Bots and transcriptions for greater than six (6) months, after which we may delete such call data.\nIf you would like to retain this information, you can go to the App\u2019s call details and share the information to your email or cloud storage account.\nYou acknowledge that you bear sole responsibility for the back-up of this information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>SMS Spam Protection</strong>.\nRoboKiller provides you with the option to enable a SMS spam protection feature which will filter SMS and MMS messages from individuals not in your Device\u2019s contacts.\nWhen you enable the SMS spam blocking feature and grant us permission, we will filter SMS text messages from individuals that are not in your Device\u2019s contacts and attempt to block any spam messages.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Phone Number Lookup Website.\n</strong>Lookup.RoboKiller.com allows you the ability to lookup a phone number to assess whether such a number is a nuisance call.\nWe may use anonymized recordings and transcripts of spam messages collected through the Service to provide this information.\nAny feedback provided by RoboKiller Users within the App may appear as comments for a given number.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Unsubscribing from RoboKiller.\n</strong>RoboKiller will instruct you to first cancel your subscription in order
