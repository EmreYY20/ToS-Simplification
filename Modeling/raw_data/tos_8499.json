have designed the App to minimize the personal information that is collected from you.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>We collect two basic types of information from you in conjunction with your use of the App, personal information and non-personal information.\n&nbsp;Personal information is information that you supply to us, as described more fully below.\n&nbsp;Non-personal information is information that does not personally identify you.\nIt is diagnostic data that we aggregate, such as which emotions are most frequently chose, which videos are watched and for how long, and other data about the performance of the App.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Personal Information</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>As a general matter, you can use and browse the App without submitting your personal information to us.\n&nbsp;However, there are a few circumstances in which you may supply us with your personal information.\n&nbsp;The following lists the ways in which we may collect your personal information.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Registration for an account on the App</li>\n<li>Profile information that You provide for Your user profile </li>\n<li>Your member ID when required to access the

do not collect, store, or have access to that information.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HealthKit data is stored locally on device.\nData shared between HealthKit and How We Feel is not synced or stored anywhere else.</li>\n<li>HealthKit data will not be used for marketing, advertising or use-based data mining, including by third parties.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Non-Personal Information</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>In addition, when you interact with the App, we may collect certain information that does not identify you individually and our servers may automatically keep an activity log of your use of our App (\u201cNon-Personal Information\u201d).\nGenerally, we collect and store the following categories of Non-Personal Information:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Non-identifiable demographic data such as age, gender, and the name of emotions as part of collecting personal information</li>\n<li>Device information about your computer, browser, mobile device, or other device that you use to access the App.\n&nbsp;This information may include IP address, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type,

reports on the App\u2019s activity, and provide other services related to App activity and usage.\n&nbsp;These analytics services use technologies that&nbsp;may collect various information&nbsp;from you&nbsp;such as your IP address, time of visit, whether you are a return visitor, and any referring site.\n&nbsp;The App does&nbsp;not use these analytics services to&nbsp;gather information that

about how the App is used, e.g.\nwhich features have the highest use, so that we can continue to improve the App.\nYou can learn about your options to opt-out of mobile tracking by certain advertising networks through your device settings.\n&nbsp;For more information about how to change these settings for Apple or Android devices, see:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Apple:

participate in these programs.\n&nbsp;It will, however, exclude you from interest-based advertising conducted through participating networks, as provided by their policies and choice mechanisms.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>How Do We Use Your Information?</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>We use the information we learn from you to help us personalize and continually improve your experience on the

CLAIMS THAT YOU AND DISCOVERY HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.\n&nbsp;This Section is deemed to be a \u201cwritten agreement to arbitrate\u201d pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act.\nYou and Organization agree that we intend that this Section satisfies the \u201cwriting\u201d requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.\nThis Section can only be amended by mutual agreement.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>We believe that arbitration is a faster, more convenient and less expensive way to resolve any disputes or disagreements that you may have with us.\nTherefore, pursuant to these Terms of Service, if you have any dispute or disagreement with us regarding (i) your use of or interaction with the App, (ii) any purchases or other transactions or relationships with Organization, or (iii) any data or information you may provide to Organization or that Organization may gather in connection with such use, interaction or transaction (collectively, \u201cOrganization Transactions or Relationships\u201d), you will not have the right to pursue a claim in court, or have a jury decide the claim and you will not have the right to bring or participate in any class action or similar proceeding in court or in arbitration.\nBy using or interacting with the App, or engaging in any other Organization Transactions or Relationships with us, you agree to binding arbitration as provided below.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>We will make every reasonable effort to informally resolve any complaints, disputes, or disagreements that you may have with us.\nIf those efforts fail, by using the App, you agree that any complaint, dispute, or disagreement you may have against Organization, and any claim that Organization may have against you, arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with these Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy, or any Organization Transactions or Relationships shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) administered by JAMS or its successor (\u201cJAMS\u201d) and conducted in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules And Procedures in effect at the time the Arbitration is initiated or, if the amount in controversy exceeds $100,000, in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules And Procedures then in effect (respectively, the \u201cApplicable Rules\u201d).\nThe Applicable Rules can be found at www.jamsadr.com.\nIf JAMS is no longer in existence, the Arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association or its successor (the \u201cAAA\u201d) instead, and conducted in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at that time (which shall be the \u201cApplicable Rules\u201d in such circumstances).\nIf JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) at the time the arbitration is filed has Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness for Consumer Arbitrations in effect which would be applicable to the matter in dispute, Organization agrees to provide the benefit of such Minimum Standards to you to the extent they are more favorable than the comparable arbitration provisions set forth in this Section, provided, however, that in no event may such Minimum Standards contravene or restrict the application of subpart (d) or (h) below.\nFurthermore, this Section shall not prevent any party from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You further agree that:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arbitrator Will Interpret This Agreement.&nbsp;The Arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the validity, interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Service and/or these arbitration provisions in this Section hereof, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Service is void or voidable;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Location of Arbitration.&nbsp;The Arbitration shall be held either: (i) at a location determined by JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) pursuant to the Applicable Rules (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you and does not require travel in excess of 100 miles from your home or place of business).\nor (ii) at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by you and Organization.\nor (iii) at your election, if the only claims in the arbitration are asserted by you and are for less than $10,000 in aggregate, by telephone or by written submission;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governing Law.&nbsp;The Arbitrator (i) shall apply internal laws of the State of California consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, or, to the extent (if any) that federal law prevails, shall apply the law of the U.S., irrespective of any conflict of law principles.\n(ii) shall entertain any motion to dismiss, motion to strike, motion for judgment on the pleadings, motion for complete or partial summary judgment, motion for summary adjudication, or federal rules of procedure, as applicable.\n(iii) shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law.\nand (iv) shall have authority to award any form of legal or equitable relief;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Class Relief.&nbsp;The Arbitration can resolve only your and/or Organization\u2019s individual claims, and the Arbitrator shall have no authority to entertain or arbitrate any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated;</p>\n<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written Award.&nbsp;The Arbitrator shall issue a written award supported by a statement of decision setting forth the Arbitrator\u2019s complete determination of the dispute and the factual findings and legal conclusions relevant to it (an \u201cAward\u201d).\nJudgment upon the Award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arbitration Costs.&nbsp;In the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of Arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Organization will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reasonable Attorney\u2019s Fees.&nbsp;In the event you recover an Award greater than Organization\u2019s last written settlement offer, the Arbitrator shall also have the right to include in the Award Organization\u2019s reimbursement of your reasonable and actual out-of-pocket attorneys\u2019 fees associated with the Arbitration, but Organization shall in all events bear its own attorneys\u2019 fees;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interpretation and Enforcement of Arbitration Clause.&nbsp;With the exception of \u201cNo Class Relief\u201d above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Applicable Rules, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.\nIf, however, \u201cNo Class Relief\u201d is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Organization shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute, and must instead bring any claims in a court of competent jurisdiction;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modification of Arbitration Clause With Notice.&nbsp;Organization may modify these arbitration provisions, but such modifications shall only become effective thirty (30) days after Organization has given notice of such modifications and only on a prospective basis for claims arising from Organization Transactions and Relationships occurring after the effective date of such notification.\nand</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small Claims Matters are Excluded.\nNo Class Relief or Joinder of Claims.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing arbitration provisions, at your option, you may bring any claim you have against Organization in your local small claims court within the U.S., if your claim is within such court\u2019s jurisdictional limit.\nprovided that such court does not have the authority to entertain any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated in such proceeding.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>General.\nAny claim relating to, and the use of, this App and the materials contained herein is governed by the laws of the State of California.\nYou consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Alameda County, California.\nA printed version of these Terms of Service will be admissible in
