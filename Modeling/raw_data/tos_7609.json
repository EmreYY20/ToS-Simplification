similar technologies to optimize the functionality of the Website, help us understand how the Website is used and provide you with interest-based advertising based upon a user\u2019s browsing activities and interests.\nFor more information about the cookies and similar technologies used on our Website, please refer to our Cookie Policy and Security page.</p>Links to Other Websites <p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Website and the Service and not to any third-party sites or hosted services you may find or access through our Website.\nIf you submit Personal Data to any of those sites or services, your information will be governed by their privacy policies.\nWe encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any site you visit or hosted service you use.</p>Social Media Widgets <p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>The Website and the Service may include social media features, such as the Twitter button, and widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs.\nThese features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Website or the Service.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>Do Not Track <p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Currently, various browsers - including Microsoft Edge, Firefox, and Safari - offer a \u201cdo not track\u201d or \u201cDNT\u201d option that relies on technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to the websites visited by the user about the user\u2019s browsers DNT preference setting.\nCircleCI does not currently commit to responding to browser\u2019s DNT preference across its Sites and Services, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent.\nCircleCI takes privacy and choices regarding privacy seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor the development around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard for DNT.</p>Security <p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>We take precautions to ensure the security of your Personal Data.\nWe follow generally accepted standards to
