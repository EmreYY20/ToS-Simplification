INSPIRE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<br>NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SITE OR INSPIRE

PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE

LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 12 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</strong>\n</p>13.\nDispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement.<p>\n<strong>13.1 Informal Dispute Resolution.</strong>&nbsp;Mindful of the high cost, time, and energy of legal disputes, both you and Inspire agree to the following dispute resolution procedure: In the event of any controversy, claim, action or dispute arising out of or related to any transaction conducted on the Site, or the breach, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of these Terms (\u201cDispute\u201d), the party asserting the Dispute shall first try in good faith to settle such Dispute by providing written notice to the other party describing the facts and circumstances (including any relevant documentation) of the Dispute and allowing the receiving party 30 days in which to respond to or settle the Dispute.\nNotice shall be sent:</p>\n<p>(a) to Inspire at: Inspire, Attn: General Counsel, 923 Haddonfield Road, Suite 300.\nCherry Hill, NJ 08002 or</p>\n<p>(b) to you at: your last-used or publicly available email address or postal address.\nBoth you and Inspire agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent which must be satisfied prior to initiating any arbitration or filing any claim against the other party.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.2 Arbitration.</strong>&nbsp;To the extent any Dispute cannot be resolved through the informal dispute resolution procedure described above, a Dispute shall be resolved through binding individual arbitration.\nArbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\nThis agreement to arbitrate Disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms.\nYOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND INSPIRE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.3 Exceptions.</strong>&nbsp;Nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court.\n(b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state or local agency if that action is available.\n(c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration.\nor (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.4 Arbitrator.</strong>&nbsp;Any arbitration between you and Inspire will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, \u201cAAA Rules\u201d) as modified by these Terms.\nThe AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Inspire.\nThe arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.5 Notice of Arbitration.\nProcess.</strong>&nbsp;A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the Dispute to the other party by certified U.S.\nMail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (\u201cNotice of Arbitration\u201d).\nInspire\u2019s address for Notice is: Inspire, 923 Haddonfield Road, Suite 300.\nCherry Hill, NJ 08002.\nThe Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or Dispute.\nand (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\u201cDemand\u201d).\nThe parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Inspire may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nAll arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Inspire must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIf the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Inspire in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, Inspire will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator.\nor (ii) $10,000.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.6 Fees.</strong>&nbsp;If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Inspire will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.\nAny arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Los Angeles County, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing.\nor (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.\nIf the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\nIn that case, you agree to reimburse Inspire for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.7 No Class Actions.</strong>&nbsp;YOU AND INSPIRE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nFurther, unless both you and Inspire agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.8 Enforceability.</strong>&nbsp;If this arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 14 below will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p>14.\nMiscellaneous.14.1 General Terms.<p>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any Additional Terms (defined below), are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Inspire regarding your use of the Site.\nYou may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent.\nWe may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent.\nThe failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.\nUse of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision.\nThroughout these Terms the use of the word \u201cincluding\u201d means \u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d.\nIf any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.</p>14.2 Governing Law.<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles that would result in the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.\nYou and Inspire submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Los Angeles County, California for resolution of any lawsuit or court proceeding permitted under these Terms.</p>14.3 Privacy Policy.<p>Please read the&nbsp;<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>&nbsp;carefully for information relating to our collection, use, storage, disclosure of your personal information.\nThe Privacy Policy is incorporated by this reference into, and made a part of, these Terms.</p>14.4 Additional Terms.<p>Your use of the Site is subject to all additional terms, policies, rules, or guidelines applicable to the Site or certain features of the Site that we may post on or link to from the Site or that you agree to in connection with certain technology or services made available to you by or on behalf of Inspire (the \u201c<strong>Additional Terms</strong>\u201d).\nAll Additional Terms are incorporated by this reference into, and made a part of, these Terms.</p>14.5 Consent to Electronic Communications.<p>By using the Site, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us.\nYou agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing.</p>14.6 Contact Information.<p>The Site is offered by Inspire.\nYou may contact us by email

similar technologies covered by the EU Directive on privacy in electronic communications.</p>\n<strong>What is a cookie?</strong>\n<p>A cookie is a small piece of data that a website asks your browser to store on your computer or mobile device.\nThe cookie allows the website to \u201cremember\u201d your actions or preferences over time.</p>\n<p>Most Internet browsers support cookies, however, users can set their browsers to decline certain types of cookies or specific cookies.\nFurther, users can delete cookies at any time.</p>\n<strong>Why do we use cookies?</strong>\n<p>We use cookies to learn how you interact with our content and to improve your experience when visiting our website.\nFor example, some cookies remember your language or preferences so that you do not have to repeatedly make these choices when you visit one of our websites.\nAdditionally, cookies allow us to serve you specific content, such as videos on our website.</p>\n<p>We may employ the learnings of your behavior on our website to serve you with targeted advertisements on third party website(s) in an effort to \u201cre-market\u201d our products and services to you.</p>\n<strong>What types of cookies do we use?</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>First Party and Third Party Cookies</strong> We use both first party and third party cookies on our website.\nFirst-party cookies are cookies issued from our website domain that are generally used to identify language and location preferences or render basic site functionality.</p>\n<p>Third party cookies belong to and are managed by other parties, such as our business partners or service providers.\nThese cookies may be required to render certain forms, such as the submission of a job application, or to allow for some advertising outside of our website.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Session Cookies</strong> Session cookies are temporary cookies that are used to remember you during the course of your visit to the website, and they expire when you close the web browser.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Persistent Cookies</strong> Persistent cookies are used to remember your preferences within the website and remain on your desktop or mobile device even after you close your browser or restart your computer.\nWe use these cookies to analyse user behaviour to establish visit patterns so that we can improve our website functionality for you and others who visit our website(s).\nThese cookies also allow us to serve you with targeted advertising and measure the effectiveness of our site functionality and advertising.</p>\n<strong>How are cookies used for advertising purposes?</strong>\n<p>Cookies and ad technology such as web beacons, pixels, and anonymous ad network tags help us serve relevant ads to you more effectively.\nThey also help us collect aggregated audit data, research, and performance reporting for advertisers.\nPixels enable us to understand and improve the delivery of ads to you and know when certain ads have been shown to you.\nSince your web browser may request advertisements and web beacons directly from ad network servers, these networks can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.</p>\n<p>Although we do not use cookies to create a profile of your browsing behavior on third party sites, we do use aggregate data from third parties to show you relevant, interest-based advertising.\nWe do not provide any personal information that we collect to advertisers.\nYou can opt out of off-site and third party-informed advertising by adjusting your cookie settings.\nOpting out will not remove advertising from the pages you visit, but, instead, opting out will result in the ads you see not being matched to your interests.\nThis implies that the ad(s) you see will not be matched to your interests by those specific cookies.</p>\n<strong>How are third party cookies used?</strong>\n<p>For some of the functions within our websites we use third party suppliers, for example, when you visit a page with videos embedded from or links to YouTube.\nThese videos or links (and any other content from third party suppliers) may contain third party cookies, and we encourage you to consult the privacy policies of these third party vendors on their websites for information regarding their use of cookies.</p>\n<strong>How do I reject and delete cookies?</strong>\n<p>You can choose to reject or block all or specific types of cookies set by virtue of your visit to our website by clicking on the cookie preferences on our website.\nYou can change your preferences for our website and/or the websites of any third party suppliers by changing your browser settings.\nPlease note that most browsers automatically accept cookies.\nTherefore, if you do not wish cookies to be used, you may need to actively delete or block the cookies.\nIf you reject the use of cookies, you will still be able to visit our websites but some of the functions may not work correctly.</p>\n<p>You may also visit the&nbsp;All About Cookies&nbsp;website for details on how to delete or reject cookies and for further information on cookies generally.\nBy using our website without deleting or rejecting some or all cookies, you agree that we can place those cookies that you have not deleted or rejected on your
