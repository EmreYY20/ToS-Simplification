arbitrate\u201d pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act.\nYou and we agree that we intend that this Section satisfies the \u201cwriting\u201d requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.\nThis Section can only be amended by mutual agreement.</p>\n<p> If any controversy, allegation, or claim arises out of or relates to the Service, the content on the Service, our Service activities and submissions, and/or the Terms of Use, whether heretofore or hereafter arising (collectively a \u201cDispute\u201d), you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute along with a proposed resolution of it.\nOur notice to you will be sent to the most recent contact information that you provide to us.\nIf no such contact information exists or if contact information is not current, then we have no obligation to contact you to try to resolve the Dispute.\nYour notice to us must be sent to us at the following address:</p>\n<p>AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\n<br>\nAttn: Legal <br>\n4040 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1000 <br>\nArlington, VA 22203.</p>\n<p>For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, we and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute, although nothing will require either party to agree to any resolution.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Binding Arbitration:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth above within sixty (60) days of receipt of the required notice, and unless you provide us notice of opt-out within five (5) business days of your first use of the Service, addressed to: DMCA-Contact@avalonbay.com, then ANY AND ALL DISPUTES ARISING BETWEEN YOU AND US (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, STATUTE, REGULATION, ORDINANCE, TORT \u2013 INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO FRAUD, ANY OTHER INTENTIONAL TORT, OR NEGLIGENCE \u2013 COMMON LAW, CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION, RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR, AGENCY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY), WHETHER ARISING BEFORE OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THESE TERMS, MUST BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION.\nTHIS INCLUDES ANY AND ALL DISPUTES BASED ON ANY PRODUCT, SERVICE OR ADVERTISING CONNECTED TO THE USE OR PROVISION OF THIS SERVICE.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d), and not state law, shall govern the arbitrability of all disputes between us and you regarding these Terms and the Service.\nYou and we agree, however, that Virginia law shall apply to and govern, as appropriate, any and all claims or causes of action, remedies and damages arising between you and us regarding a Dispute, whether arising or stated in contract, statute, common law, or any other legal theory, without regard to Virginia\u2019s choice of law principles that might apply other states\u2019 laws.</p>\n<p> Disputes will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d).\nIf a party properly submits a Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling to hold a hearing, then either party may elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.\n(\u201cJAMS\u201d) using JAMS\u2019 streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures in accordance with Virginia\u2019s civil rules governing discovery.\nIf an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the \u201cmetropolitan statistical area\u201d (as defined by the U.S.\nCensus Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration.\nYou and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator\u2019s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules.\nbut if applicable arbitration rules or laws require us to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section to be enforceable, then we will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration.\nThe arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, then by striking from a list of arbitrators supplied by AAA or JAMS (depending on the arbitral forum).\nThe arbitration shall be a confidential proceeding, closed to the general public.\nprovided, however, that a party may disclose information relating to the arbitration proceedings to its and its affiliates\u2019 lawyers, insurance providers, auditors and other professional advisers.\nThe fact that there is a dispute between the parties that is the subject of arbitration shall be confidential to the same extent.\nThe arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of the Terms of Use, will be bound by these Terms of Use, will determine any Dispute according to the applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim.\nThis arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms or the Service.\nPrior to appointment of the arbitrator or for remedies beyond the jurisdiction of an arbitrator, either party may, at any time, seek pendente lite relief (subject to the provisions of these Terms waiving or limiting that relief) in a court of competent jurisdiction in Arlington County, Virginia or, if sought by AvalonBay, such other court that may have jurisdiction over you, without thereby waiving its right to arbitration of the dispute or controversy under this Section.\nThe losing party to the arbitration shall have fifteen (15) business days after the issuance of the arbitrator\u2019s decision to fully comply with such decision, after which the prevailing party may enforce such decision by a petition to a court of competent jurisdiction in Arlington County, Virginia or, in the case of you, such other court having jurisdiction over you, which may be made ex parte, for confirmation and enforcement of the award.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Injunctive Relief</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The foregoing provisions of this Section will not apply to any legal action taken by us to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with any loss, cost or damage (or any potential loss, cost or damage) relating to any Dispute and/or our rights, our operations, and/or our products or services.\nFurther, as permitted by applicable law, alleged loses, damages, or injuries claimed in connection with your use of the Service will not be deemed irreparable or sufficient to entitle you to an injunction or other equitable relief.\nThus, without limitation, you agree that you will not seek (and you will not be permitted to obtain) any relief in any court or other legal proceeding that may interfere with or prevent the development or exploitation of any website, application, content, UGC, product, service, or intellectual property owned, licensed, used, or controlled by AvalonBay or by a licensor of AvalonBay.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>No Class Action Matters</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be joined or consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.\nYOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nNotwithstanding any provision in the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules or JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures to the contrary, there shall be no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class basis or any other basis involving Disputes brought to a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, or other person or entities similarly situated.\nBut if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in this Section to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court in Alexandria, Virginia (to which jurisdiction and venue you irrevocably consent).\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this Section, any and all issues relating to the scope, interpretation and enforceability of these class action waiver provisions are to be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring a qualifying claim in small claims court.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Investigations.\nCooperation with Law Enforcement.\nTermination.\nSurvival </strong>\n</p>\n<p>As permitted by applicable law, AvalonBay reserves the right, without limitation, to: (i) investigate any suspected breaches of its Service security or its information technology or other systems or networks, (ii) investigate any suspected breaches of these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, (iii) use any information obtained by AvalonBay in accordance with its U.S.\nState Privacy Notice&nbsp;in connection with reviewing law enforcement databases or complying with applicable laws and use and/or disclose any information obtained by AvalonBay to comply with law enforcement requests or legal requirements in accordance our U.S.\nState Privacy Notice, (iv) involve and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating any of the foregoing matters, (v) prosecute violators of these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, and (vi) discontinue the Service, in whole or in part, or, suspend or terminate your access to it, in whole or in part, including any user accounts or registrations, at any time, without notice, for any reason and without any obligation to you or any third-party.\nAny suspension or termination will not affect your obligations to us under these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms.\nUpon suspension or termination of your access to the Service, or upon notice from us, all rights granted to you under these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms will cease immediately, and you agree that you will immediately discontinue use of the Service.\nThe provisions of these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, which by their nature should survive your suspension or termination will survive, including the rights and licenses you grant to AvalonBay in these Terms, as well as the indemnities, releases, disclaimers, and limitations on liability and the provisions regarding jurisdiction, choice of law, no class action, and mandatory arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Severability</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, that provision will be severed from these Terms, and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Complete Terms</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Please note that these Terms, along with any other documents incorporated by reference, make up the entire agreement between you and AvalonBay.\nWe reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you.\nYou may not transfer any rights given or obligations borne to you under these Terms without our express consent.\nWe do not waive any provision under these Terms even if it is not enforced.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Contact Us</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you have any questions regarding our Terms of Use or our practices, you can contact us at:</p>\n<p>AvalonBay Communities

without Consumer privacy rights, we will consider requests but will apply our discretion with respect to if and how we process such requests.\nWe will also consider applying state law rights prior to the effective date of such laws, but will do so in our discretion.\n</p>\n<p> To submit a request to exercise your Consumer privacy rights, or to submit a request as an authorized agent, use our Consumer Rights Request page here, or call us at 1-833-605-4293 between the hours of 9 AM and 5 PM ET, Monday through Friday, and respond to any follow-up inquiries we make.\nPlease be aware that we do not accept or process requests through other means (e.g., via fax, chats, social media etc.).\nMore details on the request and verification process is in Section 2(g) below.\nThe Consumer rights we accommodate are as follows:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(a)\tRight to Limit Sensitive PI Processing</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We only Process Sensitive PI for purposes that are exempt from Consumer choice under U.S.\nPrivacy Laws.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(b)\tRight to Know/Access</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Residents of California, Virginia, and Colorado are entitled to access PI up to twice in a 12-month period.\nResidents of Connecticut and Utah are entitled once every 12-month period to access PI maintained by Company, with subsequent requests subject to a service fee.\nWe apply the same limitation on number of Verifiable Consumer Requests in Connecticut and Utah to all states other than California, Virginia, and Colorado.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(1)\tCategories (available for California Residents Only)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>California residents have a right to submit a request for any of the following for the period that is 12-months prior to the request date:</p>\n<p>\u2022\tThe categories of PI we have collected about you.</p>\n<p>\u2022\tThe categories of sources from which we collected your PI.</p>\n<p>\u2022\tThe Business Purposes or Commercial Purposes for our collecting or Selling your

request limits, of your PI that we have collected and are maintaining.\nFor your specific pieces of PI, as required by applicable U.S.\nPrivacy Laws, we will apply the heightened verification standards as described below.\nWe have no obligation to re-identify information or to keep PI longer than we need it or are required to by applicable law to comply with access requests.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(c)\tDo Not Sell / Share / Target</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Under the various U.S.\nPrivacy Laws there are broad and differing concepts of \u201cSelling\u201d PI for which an opt-out is required.\nCalifornia also has an opt-out from \u201cSharing\u201d for Cross-Context Behavioral Advertising (use of PI from different businesses or services to target advertisements).\nOther states have an opt-out of \u201cTargeted Advertising\u201d (defined differently but also addressing tracking, profiling, and targeting of advertisements).\nWe may Sell or Share your PI and/or use your PI for Targeted Advertising, as these terms apply under U.S.\nPrivacy Laws.\nHowever, we provide U.S.\nConsumers an opt out of Sale/Sharing/Targeting that is intended to combine all of these state opt-outs into a single opt-out available regardless of state of residency.\n</p>\n<p>Third-Party digital businesses (\u201c<strong>Third-Party Digital Businesses</strong>\u201d) may associate cookies and other tracking technologies that collect PI about you on our services, or otherwise Collect and Process PI that we make available about you, including digital activity information.\nWe understand that giving access to PI on our services, or otherwise, to Third-Party Digital Businesses could be deemed a Sale and/or Share under some state laws and thus we will treat such PI (e.g., cookie ID, IP address, and other online IDs and internet or other electronic activity information) collected by Third-Party Digital Businesses, where not limited to acting as our Service Provider (or Contractor or Processor), as a Sale and/or Share and subject to a Do Not Sell/Share/Target opt-out request.\nWe will not Sell your PI, Share your PI for Cross-Context Behavioral Advertising, or Process your PI for Targeted Advertising if you make a Do Not Sell/Share/Target opt-out request.\n</p>\n<p>Opt-out for non-cookie PI: If you want to limit our Processing of your non-cookie PI (e.g., your email address) for Targeted Advertising, or opt-out of the Sale/Sharing of such data, make an opt-out request here.\n</p>\n<p>Opt-out for cookie PI: If you want to limit our Processing of your cookie-related PI for Targeted Advertising, or opt-out of the Sale/Sharing of such PI, you need to exercise a separate opt-out request on our cookie management tool here (Your Privacy Choices).\nThis is because we have to use different technologies to apply your opt-out of cookie PI and to non-cookie PI.\nOur cookie management tool enables you to exercise such an opt-out request and enable certain cookie preferences on your device.\nYou must exercise your preferences on each of our websites you visit, from each browser you use, and on each device that you use.\nSince your browser opt-out is designated by a cookie, if you clear or block cookies, your preferences will no longer be effective and you will need to enable them again via our cookie management tool.\nBeware that if you use ad blocking software, our cookie banner may not appear when you visit our services and you may have to use the link above to access the tool.\n</p>\n<p>Opt-out preference signals (also known as global privacy control or GPC): Some of the U.S.\nPrivacy Laws require businesses to process GPC signals, which is referred to in California as opt-out preference signals (\u201c<strong>OOPS</strong>\u201d), which are signals sent by a platform, technology, or mechanism, enabled by individuals on their devices or browsers, that communicate the individual\u2019s choice to opt-out of the Sale and Sharing of personal information.\nTo use an OOPS/GPC, you can download an internet browser or a plugin to use on your current internet browser and follow the settings to enable the OOPS/GPC.\nWe have configured the settings of our consent management platform to receive and process GPC signals on our website, which is explained by our consent management platform here.\nWe process OOPS/GPC with respect to Sales and Sharing that may occur in the context of Collection of cookie PI by tracking technologies online by Third-Party Digital Businesses, discussed above, and apply it to the specific browser on which you enable OOPS/GPC.\nWe currently do not, due to technical limitations, process OOPS/GPC for opt-outs of Sales and Sharing in other contexts (e.g., non-cookie PI).\nWe do not: (1) charge a fee for use of our service if you have enabled OOPS/GPC.\n(2) change your experience with any product or service if you use OOPS/GPC.\nor (3) display a notification, pop-up, text, graphic, animation, sound, video, or any interstitial in response to the OOPS/GPC.</p>\n<p>We do not knowingly Sell or Share the PI of Consumers under 16, unless we receive affirmative authorization (\u201copt-in\u201d) from either the Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years old, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer who is less than 13 years old.\nIf you think we may have unknowingly collected PI of a Consumer under 16 years old, please Contact Us.</p>\n<p> We may disclose your PI for the following purposes, which are not a Sale or Share: (i) if you direct us to

Transaction.\nand (iv) as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(d) Right to Delete</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Except to the extent we have a basis for retention under applicable law, you may request that we delete your PI.\nOur retention rights include, without limitation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to complete transactions and services you have requested;</li>\n<li>for security purposes;</li>\n<li>for legitimate internal Business Purposes (e.g., maintaining business records);</li>\n<li>to comply with law and to cooperate with law enforcement.\nand</li>\n<li>to exercise or

you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(e) Correct your PI</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Consumers may bring inaccuracies they find in their PI that we maintain to our attention and we will act upon such a complaint as required by applicable law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(f)\tAutomated Decision Making/Profiling</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We only engage in Automated Decision Making or Profiling in ways that are exempt from Consumer choice

Request</strong>\n</p>\n<p>As permitted or required by applicable U.S.\nPrivacy Laws, any request you submit to us must be a Verifiable Consumer Request, meaning when you make a request, we may ask you to provide verifying information, such as your name, e-mail, and phone number.\nYou will then be contacted for further verification which typically will involve use of an application that will

information provided and may request additional information (e.g., transaction history) via e-mail or other means to ensure we are interacting with the correct individual.\nWe will not fulfill your Right to Know (Categories), Right to Know (Specific Pieces), Right to Delete, or Right to Correction request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we collected PI.\nWe do not verify opt-outs of Sell/Share/Target or Limitation of Sensitive PI requests unless we suspect fraud.</p>\n<p>We verify each request as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>Right to Know (Categories) (available for California residents only):</em> We verify your Request to Know Categories of PI to a reasonable degree of certainty or a reasonably high degree of certainty depending on the verification method used.\nIf we cannot do so, we will refer you to this Notice for a general description of our data practices.\n</li>\n<li>\n<em>Right to Know (Specific Pieces)</em>\n<em>:</em> We verify your Request To Know Specific Pieces of PI to a reasonably high degree of certainty.\nIf you fail to provide requested information, we will be unable to verify you sufficiently to honor your request, but we will then treat it as a Right to Know Categories Request if you are a California resident.\n</li>\n<li>\n<em>Do Not Sell/Share/Target &amp.\nLimit SPI</em>\n<em>:</em> No specific verification required unless we suspect fraud.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Right to Delete:</em> We verify your Request to Delete to a reasonable degree of certainty or to a reasonably high degree of certainty depending on the verification method used, the sensitivity of the PI, and the risk of harm to the Consumer posed by unauthorized deletion.\nIf we cannot verify you sufficiently to honor a deletion request, you can still make a Do Not Sell/Share/Target and/or Limit SPI request.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Correction</em>: We verify your Request to Correct PI to a reasonable degree of certainty or to a reasonably high degree of certainty, depending on the verification method used, the sensitivity of the PI, and the risk of harm to the Consumer posed by unauthorized correction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> To protect Consumers, if we are unable to verify you sufficiently, we will be unable to honor your request.\nWe will use PI provided in a Verifiable Consumer Request only to verify your identity or authority to make the request and to track and document request responses, unless you also gave it to us for another purpose.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(2)\tAgent Requests</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may use an authorized agent to make a request for you, subject to our verification of the agent, the agent\u2019s authority to submit requests on your behalf, and of you.\nYou can learn how to do this by visiting the agent section of our Consumer Rights Request page here.\nOnce your agent\u2019s authority is confirmed, they may exercise rights on your behalf subject to the agency requirements of applicable U.S.\nPrivacy Laws.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(3)\tAppeals</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may appeal Company\u2019s decision regarding a request by following the instructions in our response to you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(h)\tOur Responses</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Some PI that we maintain is insufficiently specific for us to be able to associate it with a Consumer (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID).\nWe do not include that PI in response to those requests.\nIf we deny a request, in whole or in part, we will explain the reasons in our response.\n</p>\n<p>We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify Consumer PI that we Process to respond to your Consumer request(s).\nIn some cases, particularly with voluminous and/or typically irrelevant data, we may suggest you receive the most recent or a summary of your PI and give you the opportunity to elect whether you want the rest.\nWe reserve the right to direct you to where you may access and copy responsive PI yourself.\nWe will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests.\nprovided, however, that we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome.\nIf we determine that the request warrants a fee, or that we may refuse it, we will give you notice explaining why we made that decision.\nYou will be provided a cost estimate and the opportunity to accept such fees before we will charge you for responding to your request.</p>\n<p> Consistent with applicable U.S.\nPrivacy Laws and our interest in the security of your PI, we will not deliver to you your Social Security number, driver\u2019s license number, or other government-issued ID number, financial account number, any health or medical identification number, an account password, security questions or answers, or unique Biometric Information generated from measurements or technical analysis of human characteristics in response to a Consumer privacy rights request.\nhowever, you may be able to access some of this information yourself through your account if you have an active account with us.</p>\n<p>Return to navigation</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\nNON-DISCRIMINATION/NON-RETALIATION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We will not discriminate or retaliate against you in a manner prohibited by applicable U.S.\nPrivacy Laws for your exercise of your Consumer privacy rights.\nWe may charge a different price or rate, or offer a different level or quality of good or service, to the extent that doing so is reasonably related to the value of the applicable PI.</p>\n<p>Return to navigation</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nNOTICE OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVE PROGRAMS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We do not currently offer discounts or rewards to Consumers for providing us PI, or set price or service differences related to the collection, retention, sale, or sharing of PI.\nHowever, we may inform you of discounts, rewards, or other benefits offered by other businesses, and they may collect PI from you in connection with these benefits.\nSuch benefits and PI collection are governed by their privacy policies and terms, and not ours.\n</p>\n<p>If we offer such programs in the future, we will update this Notice to describe such program(s), including how you may opt-in and how we value the PI required.\nCalifornia Personnel should see the Notice of Financial Incentive Programs in our California Personnel Privacy Notice.</p>\n<p>Return to navigation</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.\nOUR RIGHTS AND THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, we may collect, use and disclose your PI as required or permitted by applicable law and this may override your rights under U.S.\nPrivacy Laws.\nIn addition, we are not required to honor your requests to the extent that doing so would infringe upon our or another person\u2019s or party\u2019s rights or conflict with applicable law.</p>\n<p>Return to navigation</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nADDITIONAL NOTICE FOR CALIFORNIA

promotions, contests, or sweepstakes on the Service, or when you post information to an interactive forum, bulletin board, or chat room.\nWe may also collect Personally Identifiable Information when

certain UGC they have posted on the Service, click here.</p>\n<p> Additionally, the Service may offer you the option to send a communication to a friend or other contact.\nIf so, AvalonBay relies on you to only send to people that have given you permission to do so.\nThe recipient\u2019s Personally Identifiable Information you provide (e.g., name, e-mail address) will be used to facilitate the communication, but not used by AvalonBay for any other marketing purpose unless AvalonBay obtains consent from that person.\nYour contact information and message may be included in the communication.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.\nTHIRD-PARTY CONTENT, THIRD-PARTY SERVICES, AND SOCIAL FEATURES</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Service may include or link to third-party websites, apps, ads, locations, platforms, code (e.g., plug-ins, application programming interfaces (<strong>\u201cAPI\u201d</strong>), and software development kits (<strong>\u201cSDKs\u201d</strong>) or other services (<strong>\u201cThird-Party Service(s)\u201d</strong>).\nThese Third-Party Services may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other technologies (collectively, \u201cTracking Technology\u201d) to independently collect information about you and may solicit Personally Identifiable Information from you.</p>\n<p>Certain functionalities on the Service permit interactions that you initiate between the Service and certain Third-Party Services, such as third-party social networks (<strong>\u201cSocial Features\u201d</strong>).\nExamples of Social Features include: enabling you to send content between the Service and a Third-Party Service and to otherwise connect the Service to a Third-Party Service (e.g., to pull or push information to or from the Service such as through LinkedIn Job Match).\nIf you use Social Features, and potentially other Third-Party Services, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed by the Third-Party Service that you use.\nSimilarly, if you post information on a Third-Party Service that references the Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with AvalonBay in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with the Service or otherwise by AvalonBay.\nAlso, both AvalonBay and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Service and any Third-Party Service.</p>\n<p> AvalonBay is not responsible for, and makes no representations regarding, the policies or business practices of any third parties, including, without limitation, analytics Service Providers and Third-Party Services associated with the Service, and encourages you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nSECURITY</strong>\n</p>\n<p>While we take reasonable steps to secure your Personally Identifiable Information, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure.\nLikewise, no storage or processing of your Personally Identifiable Information on the Service or on other servers or databases to which the information may be transferred can be guaranteed to be completely secure.\nPlease consider this prior to submitting your Personally Identifiable Information to us via the Service.</p>\n<p> We use current security measures to safeguard your AvalonBay-Collected PII.\nThese security measures may result in the collection, recording, and analysis of online activity or communications through our Service.\nIf you do not consent to these conditions, you must discontinue your use of the Service.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Children</em>\n</p>\n<p>The Service is intended only for adults over the age of eighteen (18) and is not directed to children younger than age eighteen (18).\nAvalonBay also does not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from children under the age of thirteen (13) on the Service and will delete any information if later determined to be from a person younger than age thirteen (13) as required by applicable law.</p>\n<p>Any California residents under the age of eighteen (18) who have registered to use the Service, and who posted content or information on the Service, can request removal by contacting AvalonBay at&nbsp;privacy@avalonbay.com, detailing where the content or information is posted and attesting that you posted it.\nAvalonBay will then make reasonable good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view or anonymize it so the minor cannot be individually identified to the extent required by applicable law.\nThis removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal.\nFor instance, third parties may have republished or archived content by search engines and others that AvalonBay does not control.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.\nPRIVACY POLICY CHANGES</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This Policy may change prospectively from time to time effective upon posting of the updated notice on our Service.\nYour continued use of the Service after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please review this Policy periodically for updates.\nTo the extent any provision of this Policy is found by a competent tribunal to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed to the extent necessary for the remainder to be valid and enforceable.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.\nEXERCISING CONTROL OVER YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In general, you may browse the Service without providing Personally Identifiable Information.\nHowever, if you choose not to provide certain information through the Service or a Portal Site, we may not be able to provide certain services or process certain of your requests.\nYou may not be able to submit an application for employment or residency, may not be able to access resident services online, or otherwise use all of the features and products that we make available online.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Updating your information</em>\n</p>\n<p>Depending on the functionality associated with the Service feature you are using, you may be able to update certain of your Personally Identifiable Information on the Service by following the instructions provided there.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Communications</em>\n</p>\n<p>You can opt out of receiving certain promotional communications (emails or text messaging) from us at any time by (i) for promotional e-mails, following the instructions provided in emails to click on the unsubscribe link, or if available by changing your communication preferences by logging onto your account.\n(ii) for text messages, following the instructions provided in text messages from AvalonBay to text the word, \u201cSTOP\u201d.\nand (iii) for app push notifications turn off push notifications on the settings of your device and/or the app, as applicable.\nPlease note that your opt-out is limited to the e-mail address or phone number used and will not affect subsequent subscriptions.\nIf you opt-out of only certain communications, other subscription communications may continue.\nEven if you opt out of receiving promotional communications, we may, subject to applicable law, continue to send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account, transactions, servicing, or AvalonBay\u2019s ongoing business relations.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Consent to transfer</em>\n</p>\n<p>The Service is operated in the United States.\nYour Personally Identifiable Information will be processed and shared in the United States, where data protection and privacy regulations may provide different levels of protection compared with non-United States jurisdictions.\nYour use of the Service or provision of any information therefore constitutes your consent to the transfer to and from, processing, usage, sharing, and storage of your information, including Personally Identifiable Information, in the U.S.\nas set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.1 <strong>Additional Information for Certain U.S.\nResidents</strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We have a separate notice regarding rights of certain U.S.\nresidents, which is available&nbsp;here.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.2 EU Residents</strong>\n</p>\n<p>AvalonBay provides services exclusively within the United States

\"our\"</strong> or <strong>\"us\"</strong>) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your information.\n</p>\n<p>When you visit the Web Site, we automatically collect certain information about your activities (\"Web Site Usage Information\").\nWe use the information we collect to enhance your visit to the Web Site and to provide you with information tailored to your needs.</p>\n<p>Web Site Usage Information is information about how our visitors use and navigate the Web Site.\nThis includes, for example, the number and frequency of visitors to each web page, the length of their stays, the type of browser each visitor is using to view the Web Site (for example, Internet Explorer, Firefox), the type of operating system each visitor is using, (for example, WindowsOS, Mac OS), the domain name of each visitor's Internet service provider, the location data such as the visitor\u2019s IP address, the address (or \"URL\") of the web site that the visitor came from before visiting the Web Site, which pages were visited on the Web Site, what was clicked on, and certain other available information.\nAn IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet, which our web servers use to identify where to send the information your computer requests.\nWhen you request pages from the Web Site, our servers log your IP address as well as information about your activities on those pages.\nTo collect this Web Site Usage Information, the Web Site and any e-mails sent to you by the Web Site (or otherwise by AvalonBay Communities, Inc.) may utilize cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts or similar technologies.</p>\n<p>A <strong>cookie</strong> is a small data file sent to your browser when you visit the Web Site, and stored on your computer.\nCookies automatically identify your web browser to the Web Site whenever you visit the Web Site, and may make navigating and using the Web Site easier for you.\nAlso, by tracking how and when you use the Web Site, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not.\nAdditionally, accepting cookies may allow you to, among other things, personalize and enhance your experience on the Web Site.\nIf you do not wish to allow for use of cookies, you can generally opt-out of providing this information by setting your browser to reject cookies.\nHowever, please be aware that some areas of the Web Site may not provide you with an acceptable user experience if you have disabled the use of cookies.</p>\n<p>A <strong>web beacon</strong> is a small, often invisible, graphic element included in a web page or e-mail.\nIt allows the party that set the web beacon to monitor and collect certain limited information about the viewer of the web page or e-mail message (such as the type of browser downloading the web beacon, the IP address of the computer that the web beacon is sent to and the time the web beacon was viewed, as well as the URL of the page the web beacon comes from).\nWe may use web beacons for many purposes, such as to count visitors to the Web Site, or to monitor how visitors navigate the Web Site, and we may include web beacons or similar technologies in e-mails in order to count how many e-mails (or particular articles, links, etc.) we sent were actually opened.</p>\n<p>An <strong>embedded script</strong> is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Web Site.\nIt is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from our Web server or a third party we work with, is active only while you are connected to the Web Site, and is deleted thereafter.</p>\n<p>Web Site Usage Information is frequently anonymous information, since it is not normally associated with you or your identity.\nIt may be used for a number of purposes, such as system administration, to help us understand the demographics of the visitors to the Web Site, to enhance the performance and usefulness of the Web Site, to report aggregate information to our business partners, or to audit use of the Web Site.\nIf Web Site Usage Information is combined with your Personal Information in a manner that it is directly associated with your identity, then it will be treated as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Types of cookies and tags on our Web site</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We
