rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).\nIf it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.\nThe laws of Ohio, U.S.A., excluding Ohio\u2019s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services.\nAll claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services will be

transaction fees, will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date indicated on the \"Account\" page.\nThe length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription that you choose when you signed up for the service.\nMembership fees are fully earned upon payment.\nIn some cases your payment date may change, for example if your Payment Method has not successfully settled, when you change your subscription plan or if your paid membership began on a day not contained in a given month.\nVisit the Pet Friend.com website and click on the \"Billing details\" link on the \"Account\" page to see your next payment date.\nWe may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of membership or service-related charges through various methods, including authorizing it up to approximately one month of service as soon as you register.\nIf you signed up for Pet Friend using your account with a third party as a Payment Method, you can find the billing information about your Pet Friend membership by visiting your account with the applicable third party.\n<br>2.\nPayment Methods.\nTo use the Pet Friend service you must provide one or more Payment Methods.\nYou authorize us to charge any Payment Method associated to your account in case your primary Payment Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your subscription fee.\nYou remain responsible for any uncollected amounts.\nIf a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method.\nFor some Payment Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method.\nCheck with your Payment Method service provider for details.\n<br>3.\nUpdating your Payment Methods.\nYou can update your Payment Methods by going to the \"Account\" page.\nWe may also update your Payment Methods using information provided by the payment service providers.\nFollowing any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable Payment Method(s).\n<br>4.\nCancellation.\nYou can cancel your Pet Friend membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the Pet Friend service through the end of your billing period.\nTo cancel, go to the \"Account\" page on our Pet Friend.com website and follow the instructions for cancellation.\nIf you cancel your membership, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period.\nTo see when your account will close, click \"Billing details\" on the \"Account\" page.\nIf you signed up for Pet Friend using your account with a third party as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your Pet Friend membership, you may need to do so through that third party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from the Pet Friend service through that third party.\n<br>5.\nChanges to the Price and Subscription Plans.\nWe reserve the right to change our subscription plans or adjust pricing for our service or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion.\nExcept as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms of Use, any price changes or changes to your subscription plan will take effect following notice to you.\n<br>6.\nNo Refunds.\nPayments are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used membership periods.\nFollowing any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period.\nAt any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members (\"credits\").\nThe amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion.\nThe provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.\n</p> Pet Friend Service<p>\nYou must be at least 18 years of age to become a member of the Pet Friend service.\nIndividuals under the age of 18 may only utilize the service with the
