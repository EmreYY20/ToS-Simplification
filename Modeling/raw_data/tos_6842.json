give support.\nExamples of these third parties include public cloud storage vendors, carriers, our payment processor, and our service provider for managing customer support tickets.\nThey only receive data needed to provide their services to us.\nWe have agreements with our service providers that say they cannot use any of this data for their own purposes or for the purposes of another third party.\nWe prohibit our service providers from selling data they receive from us or receive on our behalf.\nWe require service providers to use data only in order to perform the services we have hired them to do (unless otherwise required by law).\nFor example, we may use a company to help us provide customer support.\nThe information they may receive as part of providing that support cannot be used by them for anything else.\nBelow is the list of the vendors we currently use:</p>\n<p>Prior to engaging any third party vendors, Coding Rooms evaluates their security and privacy

implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the information we collect and store.\nUnfortunately, no security measures are 100% foolproof, and as such no network or system (including ours) can be guaranteed to be 100% secure against destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to information we collect and store.\nIf you believe your information may not be secure for any reason, please contact us immediately at hello@CodingRooms.com.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>Managing Your Information.<p>You have many choices to access information we collect about

Information), how you can opt out of collection and use of certain types of information for certain purposes (such as marketing), and how you can use your browser or third-party tools to disable certain collection methods (such as cookies or tracking technologies).</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>\n<p>You may access, correct, amend or delete information by accessing it within your account.\nIf you are

we have collected about you, please contact us at hello@CodingRooms.com.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>\n<p>If you would prefer not to accept cookies or otherwise wish to disable our use of tracking technologies, most browsers and mobile devices allow you to change your settings so as to notify you when you receive cookies or other tracking technologies are being used, and to choose whether or not to accept/allow it.\nMost browsers also allow you to disable or delete existing cookies or to automatically reject future cookies.\nPlease note that our Services do not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>\n<p>Certain tracking technologies we use are related to advertising networks, and through those technologies the advertising networks may collect certain Log Information from you.\nNo Personal Information is shared with these advertising networks, but please note that the information we share with those advertising networks might be combined with other information about you that those networks may have collected from other sources.\nTo learn more about advertising networks and how to opt out of sharing information with them, please click here and here.\nIf

(EU), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, Iceland or Switzerland, you may have legal rights with respect to your personal data, including those set forth under the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nGDPR requires that we have a \u201cbasis\u201d for processing your data.\nWe process your personal data (i) with your consent (where applicable), (ii) to perform a contract with a

not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13, unless we have received consent as detailed in Section \u201cAbility to Accept Terms\u201d of our \u201cTerms of Services\u201d.\nIf we learn that we have collected Personal Information of an unauthorized child under the age 13, we will take reasonable steps to delete such information from our files as soon as is practicable.\nPlease contact us at hello@CodingRooms.com if you believe we have any information from or about an unauthorized child under the age of 13.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>Incident Management and Response<p>We have a standardized process for responding to security incidents.\nWhen a security incident is suspected, our team is notified through a paging service and a central communication channel is established.\nAfter each incident, we conduct a post-mortem analysis to identify root causes and track any related follow-up work.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>\n<p>If we believe that a customer\u2019s personal information has been accessed or modified by an unauthorized third party, we will take all necessary steps to notify the affected customers as quickly as possible, and in no case greater than five (5) business days after we learn of the breach.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>\n<p>One of the first steps during a security incident is to verify that the attacker is completely out of the systems question, or that their impacts are minimized.\nThe second step is to identify the extent of the data breach, which should result in a list of the affected customers and data.\nIn the event of a large data breach, we will coordinate with additional legal and security resources to assist our efforts.</p>\n<p>In our communications with affected customers, we will include the following information:</p>\n<p>\u00b7 &nbsp;The nature of how the information was accessed (viewed, modified, etc)</p>\n<p>\u00b7 &nbsp;The actual information accessed</p>\n<p>\u00b7 &nbsp;What we\u2019ve done to mitigate the access</p>\n<p>\u00b7 &nbsp;What corrective actions we will take to prevent future breaches</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about our security program, please send an email to&nbsp;hello@codingrooms.com.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>Changes to Privacy Policy<p>Any information that we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.\nWe may, however, revise the Privacy Policy from time to time.\nIf a revision is material, as determined solely by us, we will notify you at the email address you have provided to us and by posting the amended policy here.\nThe current version will always be posted to our Privacy Policy page.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at
