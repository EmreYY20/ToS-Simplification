2023<p>Welcome to the website and online services (the \"Website\") of GeoGebra!</p>\n<p>Your privacy is important to us.\nThis Privacy Policy describes the information we gather from you, how we use that information, and what we do to protect it.\nBy using the Website (whether or not you are a registered user), you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this policy.<br>Children, typically students in K-12 education, are given additional and special privacy assurances, described in the section 'Our Commitment to Children's Privacy'.<br>Your use of the Website and any personal information you provide on the Website are subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and GeoGebra's Terms of Service.\nAny capitalized terms used but not defined herein

Protection Regulation, GDPR) by ensuring that each user is able to decide herself, which personal details shall be made accessible to other users.<br>Please take a moment to read everything carefully.\nIn case of further questions please do not hesitate to contact us at office@geogebra.org.</p>Our Commitment to Children's Privacy<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.\nIf GeoGebra learns that personally identifiable information of children has been collected on the Website without parental consent, then GeoGebra will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.\nIf you are a parent or legal guardian and discover that your child has a registered account with the Website without your consent, then you may alert GeoGebra at office@geogebra.org and request that GeoGebra delete that child's personal information from its systems.<br>In particular, we never share the personal information of any user with third parties.<br>It's important to remember that you do not need to register or sign in to the Website in order to use the GeoGebra software and access millions of GeoGebra resources.</p>Compliance with COPPA<p>GeoGebra complies with COPPA, the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) which is a United States federal law designed to protect the privacy of children under 13.</p>\n<p>Our services offered at geogebra.org

FERPA<p>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records.\nFERPA requires education institutions and agencies to obtain written permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any information from a student\u2019s education record.\nHere are some recommendations how our policies can help those institutions and agencies to meet the requirements under FERPA:</p>\n<p>GeoGebra products can be used by any individual and GeoGebra is not notified when our products are used.</p>\n<p>Student\u2019s work is only saved on GeoGebra when the student (or student\u2019s parents for age under 14) has created a GeoGebra account.\nThis work can be accessed by parents and eligible students under FERPA.\nIf you are a parent and discover that your child has a registered account without your consent, then you may request that GeoGebra deletes that child's saved work and account.</p>The
