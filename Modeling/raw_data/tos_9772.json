Privacy Act System of Records Notices (SORN) Show System of Records Notices (SORNs) <p>A System of Records is a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifier assigned to the individual.\nThe Privacy Act requires each agency to publish notice of its systems of records in the <em>Federal Register</em>.</p> What Is a SORN? <p>A SORN is a formal notice to the public published in the <em>Federal Register</em> that identifies the purpose for which PII is collected, from whom and what type of PII is collected, how the PII is shared externally (routine uses), and how to access and correct any PII maintained by the department.</p> When Is a SORN required? <p>A SORN is required when the department has a system of records as defined above.\nIn some instances, the Department may have an existing SORN that covers a collection of systems or programs.\nDuring the Privacy Threshold Analysis and Privacy Impact Assessment processes, our office, in coordination with the bureau privacy officer, will help determine whether a new SORN is required.</p> Office of the
