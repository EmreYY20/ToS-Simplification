Sites.\n\u201c<strong>Other Information</strong>\u201d is any information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an individual.</p>\n<p>If you submit any Personal Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Sites, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How We Collect Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>WWF and its services providers collect Personal Information that you provide while using the Sites, either directly or through other user actions, including, without limitation, any Personal Information provided or otherwise obtained while the Sites web pages are open.\nFor instance, WWF gathers information when you fill out forms on the Sites, including, for example, e-newsletter sign-up forms, donation forms, surveys and advocacy action alerts.\nWe may also use analytics that enable us to obtain your Personal Information based on your use of the Sites, including, for example, your clicks on Sites pages and page elements as well as information entered into the Sites\u2019 html form fields, regardless of whether the form is submitted.\nWe may supplement the information we collect from you with information we collect from and about you from other online and offline sources, such as public databases, social media platforms and from people with whom you are friends or otherwise connected on social media platforms.\nFor example, if you choose to connect your social media account to your Site account, certain Personal Information from your social media account will be shared with us.\nThis may include Personal Information that is part of your profile or your friends\u2019 profiles.</p>\n<p>We and our service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We use \u201ccookies\u201d to help us monitor traffic and collect information about use of the Sites.\nCookies are pieces of data placed on your device when you visit the Sites that help us recognize you when you come back to the Sites, allowing us, for instance, to remember the email address and password you use when you log in on a specific computer.\nWWF uses the aggregated information collected from cookies to measure the number of visits to the Sites, the average time spent on the Sites, the identity and number of pages viewed, aid in interest-based advertising with our partners, and to gather other traffic data and information that allows us to improve the Sites.\nWe also use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience while using the

mobile app analytics and optimization services to improve the Sites and enhance the visitor experience.\nFor examples, the Sites use&nbsp;web analytics services that may record mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling&nbsp;activity, text you type in the Sites, and similar activity.\nThe Sites do not use these services to collect any personally identifiable information not otherwise provided by you in using the Sites, and they do not track your browsing habits across other third-party websites on our behalf.</li>\n<li>We also use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and other, similar technologies to collect information about Site use anonymously and reports website trends, without identifying individual visitors.\nYou can learn about Google\u2019s practices by going

campaigns.\nIf you would like more information about this practice and to learn about your choices in connection with it, please
