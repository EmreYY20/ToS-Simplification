licensing of your Content to third parties at our discretion and may negotiate these with third parties.\nEyeEm and distribution partners may offer special pricing, packages and discounts at any time,

prices are available on our website.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>10.2 EyeEm Market \u2013 Sales notifications <p>We will inform you about sales of your Content after the expiry of any legal or contractual withdrawal period, as applicable, and after receipt of payment from the purchasers.\nYou will then receive a sales notification within the app and/or by email.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge that the

not yet received a sales notification, please contact our Support Team at support@eyeem.com first and not the licensee or user of your Content until we have checked the status of licensing.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>10.3 EyeEm Market - Your License Share and Payouts<p>When we sell your Content via EyeEm Market or our distribution partners, you will receive a share of the license or sublicense fees (\u201cLicense Share\u201d) actually received by EyeEm from the sale of your Content after deduction of sales-related taxes (including applicable transaction and currency costs) and other fees (e.g.\nwithholding tax, if applicable).\nYou will not be notified of the identity of the licensor of your Content.\n</p>\n<p>The License Share applicable to your Content sales is determined by the Payout Level, as further detailed in the table below.</p>\n<p>Payout Levels: Which Payout Level will be applicable to your sales, is defined on a quarterly basis, based on the total sales of your Content in the previous 12 months.\nBy default new users will start in Level 3 and keep this level for a period of 12 months after registration.</p>\n<p>The sale of a license to your Content and your Level will be displayed in your user account.\nYou can also opt to receive an in-app sales notification.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p> Payout Level Payout Level 4 Payout Level 3 Payout Level 2 Payout Level 1 Revenue Threshold $0 - $299 $300 - $2,999 $3,000 - $6,999 $7,000+ License Revenue Share 25% 35% 45% 55% <p>\u200d</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Payout Request: </strong>If your License Share reaches an amount of 10 USD or the equivalent amount in a local currency, to the extent this is offered by EyeEm as payout currency (\"Minimum Payout\"), you can request a payout of your License Share by submitting a \"Payout Request\" in your account.\nIn addition, you may request payment of your accumulated License Share (i) once &nbsp;a year (irrespective of whether you reached the Minimum Payout) and (ii) when you request the deletion of your user account (see section 16) by writing to customer support (support@eyeem.com).\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>EyeEm Payment Service: </strong>As soon as you have submitted a valid Payout Request, the payment will be processed by an EyeEm Payment Provider, usually within 30 days.\nPlease check if the EyeEm Payment Provider is available in your country and if you are registered for their payment service.\nPlease note that payouts (if required) can only be made via the EyeEm Payment Provider.\nAlso check whether the payout to you was successful or whether the EyeEm Payment Provider requires any further action on your end.\nEyeEm assumes no liability for a successful payout.\nIf more than one attempt has to be made to payout the License Share, due to circumstances beyond EyeEm's control, any costs incurred will be deducted from the amount of the next payout.\nYou can generate a payment receipt via your account.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Payout Paused: </strong>Should we be notified or become aware of a copyright violation or other violation of third-party rights (with regard to Content uploaded by you) after notification of a license sale to you, we are entitled to withhold pending payouts until final clarification of such legal claims.\nThis will apply to all your pending payouts of License Shares, whether or not they relate to the reported Content or other Content uploaded by you.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Payout Lapsed: </strong>&nbsp;While you have your account with us, we will keep your License Share available for payment for the period equal to the applicable statutory limitation periods (i.e.\nfor 3 years).\nAfter this period, your right to payment will lapse.\nTherefore, please check your user account regularly to see whether you have any outstanding payout claims.</p>\n<p>If you receive a notification from us (by email or via your account) that there has been a claim that your Content infringes third party rights, you must reply to that notification in writing.\nIf you do not reply within 30 days of such notification, you may, at our discretion, loose the right to a payout of the License Share for all your Content.\nThe License Share will then be deleted in your account.\n</p>\n<p>If your account is deleted, you lose the right to payouts for all accumulated and future Licenses Shares.\nPlease therefore make sure that you submit a Payment Request prior to the deletion of your account.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Refunds: If we receive a notification of a license refund to the third party licensor of your Content (for example, due to legal or contractual rights of withdrawal or return periods) after we have paid out the respective License Fee to you, we are entitled to offset the payout with future payouts or reclaim any payments already processed.\nThis also applies in cases in which Content licenses were made in violation of our Terms of Service as well as in violation of criminal laws (e.g.\ncredit card abuse, copyright infringement).</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>11.\nCredits and Moral Rights<p>EyeEm is entitled to publish and share your name and/or username with third parties (licensees and partners) in connection with the use of your Content but does not assume any responsibility for compliance with any applicable credit obligations.\n</p>\n<p>Attribution may be excluded, especially in the case of commercial use, in accordance with industry practice and applicable licensing terms.\nYou acknowledge and agree that EyeEm and licensees of your Content may use your Content with or without attribution and thus you waive your right to be named as the author of such Content to the extent permitted by law.\nYou further waive any claim of infringement of any other moral rights for those jurisdictions that permit a waiver of moral rights.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>12.\nNotifications and Communication<p>In your account settings, you may choose which notifications you want to receive via the app and email.\nWith each approval you give your consent that we can notify you about the information and topics you have selected.\nYou can revoke this consent at any time in your account settings.\n</p>\n<p>We may contact you e.g.\nvia email at any time concerning information required for the performance of the contract or fulfilment of a legal obligation.\nThe storage and processing of your personal data and the communication with you is carried out in accordance with the EyeEm Privacy Policy, which you can access on the website and in the app at any time.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>13.\nRemoval of Content<p>Content that you have only shared within the EyeEm Community can be deleted directly by yourself at any time.\nContent that has already been shared on EyeEm Magazine or social media networks may still be visible after the deletion of your content in the EyeEm Community.</p>\n<p>To delete your Content from the EyeEm Market and partner platforms, you must submit a deletion request by clicking on the \"Remove from Market\" or \"Delete\" button.\nIf you wish to delete multiple Content from EyeEm Market and/or partner platforms at once, you can also contact support@eyeem.com and provide us with the Content ID numbers that you wish to delete.\nPlease indicate whether you would like to delete the respective Content from EyeEm Market only or completely from your user account.\nComplete deletion from EyeEm Market and distribution partner platforms may take up to 180 days from the date of your deletion request.\n</p>\n<p>You hereby acknowledge and agree that your authorization for EyeEm to market and license your Content according to section 10.3 will remain valid until the Content is deleted from the EyeEm Market and all partner platforms within the time frame indicated above.\nAll license agreements entered into before complete deletion and the rights of use granted thereby remain unaffected by the request for deletion or the deletion.</p>\n<p>If you wish to delete Content from EyeEm Market because you realize it violates the rights of third parties, you should mark your request for deletion as \"urgent\" and also provide information to copyright@eyeem.com.\nIn this case, we will make every effort to delete the content more quickly and instruct our partners accordingly, but we cannot guarantee this.</p>\n<p>We may at any time and without notice delete Content from your account which in our opinion violates the Terms of Service.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>14.\nYour Liability<p>You alone - or your parents or legal guardians - are responsible for your conduct as a user and compliance with these Terms of Service and applicable laws.\n</p>\n<p>With each upload of Content, you guarantee, promise, warrant and undertake that </p>\n<p>You are the sole originator of this Content, i.e.\nyou have created it on your own, and you can freely dispose of the Content and existing rights of use and you are

harmless from and against any claims made against us by third parties for any violation of applicable laws or of your obligations or warranties under these Terms of Service.\nThis includes the costs

personal data to third parties to the extent permitted by law in the event of rights infringements.\nYou will find further information in our Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>15.\nOur

caused by slight negligence, we shall only be liable in the event of a breach of a material contractual obligation and only up to the amount of the damage foreseeable at the time of conclusion of the contract.\nMaterial contractual obligations are those whose fulfilment is essential for the proper execution of the contract and on whose compliance a contractual partner regularly relies and may rely.\n</p>\n<p>Liability for indirect and unforeseeable damages, loss of production and use, lost profits, savings and financial losses due to third party claims is excluded in the case of simple negligence - except in the case of injury to life, body or health.</p>\n<p>This clause sets out the entire liability of EyeEm under or in connection with the Agreement &nbsp;and outside of this Agreement.\nAny further liability other than in this contract is excluded - regardless of the legal nature of the asserted claim.\nHowever, the above limitations or exclusions of liability shall not apply to any mandatory strict liability (e.g.\nunder the German Product Liability Act) or liability under a strict guarantee.\n</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>16.\nTermination and Deletion of Your Account<p>You have the right to terminate the contractual relationship at any time.\nPlease contact support@eyeem.com for the deletion of your user account.\nIn this case we will delete all your Content in

payout of amounts below the applicable Payout Minimum according to section 10.3 within the deletion request process.\nWe will inform you by email about any license sale processed until complete deletion of your Content in accordance to section 13 and will therefore keep your email address in our database.\nYou will find further information in our Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>If you violate these Terms of Service, we may delete your user account at any time without prior notification and restrict you from any future registration.\nFurthermore, we may terminate our contract with a prior notice period of 4 weeks by email and delete your account and Content if your user account has not been used for at least 12 months.</p>\n<br>17.\nChanges to the Terms<p>We have the right to update the Terms

obligations from the Terms of Service and the contract established by the Terms of Service to third parties requires your prior consent.\nThis does not apply to a transfer of rights and obligations by us to affiliated companies, in particular the transfer of operational control and responsibility of the platform and other services.\nFor the transfer of rights to distribution partners, the authorization according to section 8.2 and 10 applies.</p>\n<p>The Terms of Service shall be interpreted according to German law.\nThe UN Sales Convention is hereby excluded.\nThe place of performance for the granting of rights is our registered office, if legally permissible.\nIf you use EyeEm as an entrepreneur, our company headquarters is also the exclusive place of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>The original version of these Terms of Service was written in German.\nIf there is any contradiction between the German version and a translation of the Terms of Service, the German version shall
