materials.</p> Copyrighted Materials and Peer-to-Peer File Sharing <p>Walden University respects intellectual property rights, including rights in the copyrighted materials of the institution, its students, faculty, and third parties.\nWalden University has implemented a comprehensive policy to help protect those rights and to comply with United States Copyright Law and the U.S.\nHigher Education Act\u2019s peer-to-peer file sharing provisions.\nStrict compliance with Walden University\u2019s policies is required of all Walden University students and employees.\nWalden University\u2019s policies are reviewed annually to determine their effectiveness.</p> Copyright Law <p>Under U.S.\nCopyright Law (www.copyright.gov/title17), the author of a creative work automatically owns the copyright in that work upon its creation.\nNo formal registration is required.\nownership is immediate.\nThe author can transfer ownership of a copyright to another so the copyright owner may not be the original author of the work.\nCreative works include songs, stories, poems, paintings, photographs, or other works that contain a creative element.\nOwnership of the copyright gives the owner exclusive rights in that work such as the right to display, reproduce, transmit, create derivative works from, publicly perform, distribute, and license the creative work.\nThis means that, absent permission from the creator, you may not take the creative work owned by another and exercise these rights.\nSuch a violation is called \u201cinfringement\u201d of the owner\u2019s copyright.\nFor example, if you legally purchase a music CD, you may not create copies of the music on that CD and distribute those copies to others over the Internet.\nHelping others to violate the owner\u2019s copyright by making it easy for them to distribute such materials may also be illegal.</p> Actions and Penalties for Copyright Infringement <p>Under U.S.\nCopyright Law, a copyright owner who has been the victim of copyright infringement is entitled to recover actual damages and profits from the infringer or statutory damages of up to $30,000 per violation.\nThe copyright owner has the right to permanently enjoin the infringer from further infringing activities.</p>\n<p>Walden University, recognizing and respecting intellectual property rights, requires its employees, instructors, students, and other community members to use copyrighted materials in a lawful manner.\nWalden University\u2019s Code of Conduct, as found in the Walden University\u2019s Student Handbook (http://catalog.waldenu.edu/content.php?catoid=155&amp;navoid=51011), presents Walden University\u2019s copyright policy.\nCopyright infringement can result in applicants being rejected for admission and enrolled students and employees being dismissed.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Walden University maintains a vigorous program of accepting and responding to Digital Millennium Copyright ACT (DMCA) notices, which are immediately escalated to Walden University\u2019s legal team for investigation and action.\nIf the materials in question are determined by the legal department to be infringing, the Information Technology department is notified and action is taken that can include either the removal of the infringing materials from Walden University\u2019s network or the blocking of the infringer\u2019s network access.\nThe infringer is notified and reminded of Walden University\u2019s Code of Conduct.\nRepeated violations can result in dismissal.</p> Legal Sources of
