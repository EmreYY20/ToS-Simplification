Veriff\u2019s data processing activities:</p>\n<p>(1) First, we strive to process Personal Data in a <strong>reliable and confidential way</strong>.\nEach person\u2019s right to the protection of

care about developing and deploying services that take into account privacy by design and privacy by default principles.\nCompliance with our Privacy Notice is integrated into our day-to-day activities, services and processes, and our development efforts.\nWe understand that compliance with data protection rules takes place through our employees.\nTherefore, we consider it important and we seek to ensure that our employees know and comply with the requirements thereof.\nWe expect, instruct and train our employees to respect our privacy requirements.</p>\n<p>(3) Third, <strong>we process Personal Data lawfully and purposefully</strong>.\nWe set clear goals for the processing of Personal Data and process Personal Data for these purposes only.\nWe refrain from collecting or processing the data that we do not need.\nVeriff aims to delete/blur or make in other ways unreadable any data or documents presented in the session that are not necessary for Veriff\u2019s service provision.\nThis also means all transfers of Personal Data must have a valid legal basis.</p>\n<p>(4) Fourth, <strong>we process Personal Data in a transparent and fair way</strong>.\nWe strive for an appropriate, secure, honest and lawful manner of processing the Personal Data to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or inappropriate use of Personal Data.\nWe also work to eliminate the possibility

provision of our Services or required for protecting us against legal claims.\nAt the end of the retention period, we shall permanently erase the Personal Data or anonymize it.</p>\n<p>(6) Sixth,

grounds we process your Personal Data.<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.1 We process Personal Data for the provision of our Services.</strong> Regarding Personal Data about End-Users, Veriff's main purpose for processing is to provide our Services to our Clients.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(1) Generally, the main purpose of the Service is to verify your identity, and for this purpose we capture photos and video (if applicable) of the verification session as well as data extracted from the same, such as face scans and other measurements (such extracted data may be biometric data and/or sensitive Personal Data in certain jurisdictions), and the document(s) provided for verification.\nIn addition, for verification, we conduct fraud prevention and detection checks that are an integral part of our Service.\nIdentification process results with information about the completed checks are categorized as \u201cApproved\u201d, \u201cResubmission needed\u201d or \u201cDeclined\u201d.</p>\n<p>(2) In some cases, we may also further check whether we have previously verified an End-User on behalf of the same or a different Client by comparing the session with the previous session.\nThis helps our Clients not only to verify identities but further protects them and their End-Users by helping them understand when an End-User may be generating multiple identities, tampering documents or manipulating device or network information.\nTo do all of this, we closely examine the information provided by the End-User, including machine-readable data, metadata and device and network information.</p>\n<p>(3) We mainly process End-User Personal Data as a Data Processor for the benefit of the Client in order to fulfill the Agreement entered into with the Client for (i) performance of the Agreement (including for the provision of the Service, and performance of any obligations or realization of any rights arising from the Agreement.\n(ii) the purpose of realization of rights and fulfillment of obligations deriving from legal acts.\nand (iii) processing your inquiries and requests.</p>\n<p>(4) The legal basis for the processing depends on the Client as the use cases and related legal requirements vary from Client to Client.\nThe legal basis is selected and ensured by the Client.\nIn some cases we or our Client may ask you to grant us <strong>consent for processing</strong>.\nVeriff may, as determined and as appropriate, choose to collect the consent itself, however, the relationship between the End-User and the Client remains unaffected for such collection of consent by Veriff.\nPlease note that we cannot provide the Service in respect of an anonymous End-User, and therefore the use of our Service is subject to the disclosure of Personal Data to us and allowing the processing of Personal Data by the Client and us.\nHowever, giving consent is voluntary, but failure to do so may mean that we may not be able to provide the Service.\nFor example, we will not be able to verify your identity.\nIf you have granted the Client and/or us a consent to process Personal Data, the details of such processes and purposes thereof will be outlined in the consent itself.</p>\n<p>(5) To the extent permitted by law and the Agreement, Veriff may also use Personal Data for other reasonably necessary operational purposes as part of provision of the Service, or rely on its legitimate interest for such processing as described in the next section.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.2 We also may process Personal Data of Data Subjects, including End-Users, as a Controller if processing is necessary in our legitimate interests in compliance with applicable data protection laws</strong>, meaning our interest in the management and direction of our business in order to be able to offer the best possible services on the market.\nPursuant to our \u201cFundamental Six\u201d principles for data processing, we only process Personal Data on this legal basis (legitimate interest) after careful assessment in order to ascertain that the legitimate interest is in compliance with the interests and rights of a Data Subject (after carrying out the so-called three-step test) and to the extent it is permitted by law and the Agreement, as applicable.\nFor our legitimate interest, we may process data for the following purposes:</p>\n<p>(1) for analyzing the use of our Service, and using research and analysis results, among other methods, for carrying out satisfaction surveys, feedback questionnaires and developing our products and services, including development of autonomous and automated decision-making processes;</p>\n<p>(2) for sending out newsletters, for marketing and developing and promoting our Services, for organization of campaigns, including personalized and targeted campaigns, and measuring the effectiveness of the performed marketing activities, as noted above, we will only rely on our legitimate interest to the extent this is permitted by law and the Agreement.\nPlease note that for sending out newsletters, we only process your contact details;</p>\n<p>(3) for ensuring a trust-based relationship with Clients and End-Users, for example, Personal Data processing that is strictly necessary to determine the ultimate beneficiaries, being PEP and/or to prevent fraud, e.g.\nand checks in public sanction lists or our own Service history;</p>\n<p>(4) for administration and analysis of the Client base to improve the availability, selection and quality of Services and products, and to make our Services more personalized and the best possible;</p>\n<p>(5) for building and managing of our Client relationships;</p>\n<p>(6) for analysis of identifiers and Personal Data collected upon the visit of websites, mobile applications and other Services.\nWe may use the collected data for web analysis or for the analysis of mobile and information society services, for ensuring and improving functioning, for statistical purposes and for analyzing Visitor and Client Representative behavior, and for improving the experience of Visitors and Client Representatives and for providing better and more personalized Services;</p>\n<p>(7) for monitoring the Services.\nWe may record the messages and instructions given on our premises or by means of communication (e-mail, telephone, etc.), as well as information and other operations carried out by us, and shall use those recordings as needed to evidence instructions or other operations;</p>\n<p>(8) for network, information and cyber security considerations, for example, for fighting against piracy and for ensuring the security of the Websites and Service, as well as for the measures taken for making and storing backup copies;</p>\n<p>(9) for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.\nand ensuring compliance with applicable regulations, including retaining proof of evidence of such for compliance with our legal obligations;</p>\n<p>(10) for conducting product and market research for purposes of quality assurance, product improvements, developments and assessing its market fit, this includes contacting and communication, interviews, making conclusions, recording of such communications for a limited period of time, etc.\nwith End-Users, Client Representatives and other relevant data subjects.\nThis includes creating anonymised data or anonymized or aggregated overviews and summaries of the aforementioned.\nPlease note that Veriff processes, maintains, and uses aggregated or de-identified information only in a de-identified fashion and will not attempt to re-identify such information, except as permitted by law;</p>\n<p>(11) for satisfying our legal obligations with respect to the processing and retention of Personal Data, including for obtaining the relevant legal basis for processing certain Personal Data concerning certain End-Users.\nObtaining and maintaining records that such legal basis has been obtained by us is important for us to be able to prove that we comply and adhere to our legal obligations outside of and in the European Union;</p>\n<p>(12) for fraud prevention and detection purposes, to identify signs of fraud based on our internal fraud framework and advanced fraud prevention and detection techniques and to conduct certain checks against third party sites, e.g., checks against authority databases;</p>\n<p>(13) for developing, testing, improving and altering the functionality of the Service, including for machine learning (as specified in section 6 below), data annotation, testing and training, and producing anonymised or anonymised and aggregated statistical reports and research;</p>\n<p>(14) for reasons of substantial public interest on the basis of law, including but not limited to activities relating to fraud prevention and non-discrimination (e.g., bias mitigation).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.3 We may ask you to give us your consent for processing.</strong> Veriff can process your Personal Data if you have given consent to the processing of your Personal Data for one or more specific purposes.\nPlease note that giving consent is voluntary and you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.\nFor example, you can ask us to stop using your personal data for direct marketing purposes by using the unsubscribe function at the end of the marketing email.\nHowever, we remind you that the withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.\nThese are some of the cases where Veriff processes your data based on your consent.</p>\n<p>(1) Your consent is the legal basis for processing Personal Data when you share your <strong>findings related to responsible disclosure</strong>.\nPublishing your name and/or picture on our website is only done under your written consent.\nMore about responsible disclosure can be read <strong>here</strong>.</p>\n<p>(2) Based on your consent, we may use your Personal Data to send you <strong>marketing </strong>information about our Service which you have requested from us.\nIncluding, if you have submitted a request and/or filled out a relevant form on the Website.</p>\n<p>(3) Veriff asks Client Representative's consent before recording audio and video of the <strong>Client Representative call</strong>.\nThe recording is used solely for Veriff's analytical purposes and improvement of Veriff's services and processes.\nHowever, please note that the processing may not be based on your consent and the withdrawal of your consent may not be applicable in case of recording different communications (including video) for product and market research (see as described in p 5.2(10)).</p>\n<p>(4) Veriff asks for your consent before you use Veriff\u2019s <strong>demo app or test Veriff's session flow on our website</strong>.\nThis is for the purpose of testing Veriff\u2019s verification flow.\nMore information about Veriff\u2019s Demo app can be found in section 14.</p>\n<p>(5) We may use your consent as the basis for the processing of personal data also in other cases.\nThe purpose is then specified at the time of the collection of the consent.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.4 Processing related to Office Visitors.</strong> When you visit the office premises and workplaces, we process your Personal Data if processing is necessary in our legitimate interests.\nFor example, our legitimate interest in detecting and preventing harmful or unlawful actions, ensuring safety of Veriff\u2019s property, confidential information and employees and establishing, exercising or defending of legal claims we may process Personal Data for the following purposes:</p>\n<p>(1) registering your visit to the office;</p>\n<p>(2) conducting regular video surveillance in the marked areas;</p>\n<p>(3) monitoring the use of Veriff's office WiFi network and logging the traffic in the network.\nSuch data is processed if you connect any of your devices to Veriff's office WiFi network during your visit;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(4) ensuring the health and safety during emergency situations such as in case of widespread infectious diseases&nbsp;subject to applicable laws</strong>.\nDuring the spread of infectious diseases (e.g., COVID-19), for the purpose of ensuring adequate protection of the health and safety of Veriff\u2019s employees in the workplace, you may be required to provide proof of vaccination, valid negative test result, recovery certificate or other relevant data.\nIn case you have no proof to provide, or you present medical contraindication to vaccination as proof, you will be offered on-site rapid testing, if available.\nHealth related data contained in the presented information may be sensitive Personal Data.\nBefore presenting any such Personal Data you are asked to provide us with explicit consent to visually assess your admissibility to the office premises and workplaces.\nIn any case, no information presented to Veriff is retained, meaning that no Personal Data will be accessible to Veriff after the moment you present the information.\nPlease note that giving consent is voluntary and you have the opportunity to withdraw your consent at any time, however if you refuse to provide the proof, conduct the rapid testing or if the rapid test result is positive, you must leave the office immediately.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.5 Processing for a new purpose.</strong> When Personal Data processing is carried out for a new purpose different from those for which the Personal Data was originally collected or is not based on the consent given by the Data Subject, we shall carefully assess the permissibility of such new processing under applicable laws.\nIn order to determine whether the processing for the new purpose follows the purpose for which the Personal Data was originally collected, Veriff shall take into consideration, inter alia, the following:</p>\n<p>(1) any link between the old and new purposes for which the Personal Data was collected and the intended further purposes of processing;</p>\n<p>(2) the context of collecting the Personal Data, in particular regarding the relationship between the Data Subject and us;</p>\n<p>(3) the nature of the Personal Data, in particular whether sensitive Personal Data are processed;</p>\n<p>(4) possible consequences of the intended further processing for the Data Subjects;</p>\n<p>(5) existence of appropriate protection measures which may consist in, for example, encryption and pseudonymization.</p>\n<p>\n</p>6.\nTechnological aspects of our Service provision and developmentTo verify your identity in a secure and less error-prone way, we use automatic algorithms and machine learning for our Service.\nRead about it in this section.<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.1 Machine learning means the use and development of computer systems</strong> that are able to learn and adapt without following explicit instructions, by using algorithms and statistical models to analyze and draw inferences from patterns in data.\nUsing machine learning helps us to recognize specific patterns in information and make predictions about new sets of information based on those patterns.\nThe main aim of teaching our models is to have more precise (i.e.\naccurate, less error-prone) and safe models that also avoid bias.\nAll models are constantly reviewed by the model itself and by humans, and adjustments for more precise and error-free results are made, as necessary.\nAs a result of such machine learning processes Veriff's service improves.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.2</strong> It is important that algorithms are built, trained and tested on training sets, which consist of real data (see description of data categories above in Section 4.1).\nAll machine learning models are highly dependent on the quality of input data.\nSuch processing is only done for internal use to improve and develop our services and done only based on the contractual mandate received from our Clients under the precondition that a valid legal basis has been obtained.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.3</strong> Veriff stands for the concept that machine learning is conducted in an ethical and trustworthy way that respects human rights and freedoms.\nMachine learning as a tool will enable End-Users to receive better, more secure and faster services provided by Veriff's Clients and help to prevent and detect fraud.\nDatasets used to develop, test and train are kept in separate, monitored and highly secure data research environments.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.4 Veriff uses a verification engine trained with machine learning to provide Services to our Clients</strong>.\nThe verification process is either automated, semi-automated or done by a human:</p>\n<p>(1) <strong>Semi-automated verification process</strong>.\nThis means that a human will be involved if the automated verification algorithm (the Verification Engine) is not able to reach a decision on its own.\nSimply put the verification engine checks the input data against the predetermined decision profile and based on that reaches a decision.\nThe Verification Engine is constantly learning to correctly classify and match information, detect identity fraud or theft, and to verify identity, however the assistance of a human could be needed if the picture is blurry, confidence of the quality of extracted information is low or the Verification Engine runs into some other difficulty in analyzing the verification session.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(2) <strong>Fully automated verification process.\n</strong>This means that the Verification Engine verifies your identity without human involvement.\nWhen performing a fully automated verification process, our Client informs you of the automated processing and may ask your explicit consent to do this.\nHowever, in some cases, where the Client has other legal grounds for such processing e.g.\nobligations under applicable law \u2013 consent may not be needed.\nYou have the right to ask for information and an explanation regarding the logic behind the decision the Verification Engine has made.\nat any time, you will have the right to request human intervention or object to the decision made on grounds relating to your particular situation.</p>\n<p>(3) We may have different solutions for processing with different Clients, e.g.\nin some cases the verification session will <strong>only be analyzed by a human</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.5 </strong>We would like to point out that the decision on whether the Client provides its service to the End-User is made by the Client.\nMeaning, even if the verification flow has been fully automated, the verification result will be taken into account by the Client for the decision on whether to provide its service or not.\nThe verification results itself - \u201cApproved\u201d, \u201cResubmission needed\u201d or \u201cDeclined\u201d - are not determinative for whether the Client\u2019s service is provided to the End-User.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.6 Machine learning is also the driving engine for Veriff's innovation</strong> when improving our Services, testing new features and ensuring quality Services.\nFor further improvement of our Services, Service performance and features testing (A/B tests) is used to analyze the End-User experience and response regarding changes to the structure, text or any other feature of Veriff's Service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.7</strong> Fraud prevention and detection is a vital part of Veriff\u2019s Service.\nDetection of activities matching a certain pattern may lead to profile generation, in particular for fraud prevention and detection purposes.\nIn compliance with the instructions received from the Client, Veriff may analyze and compare the data points available in relation to the End-User as part of the Service.\nFor example, Veriff may compare if session media matches each other and if technical data indicates associations with previously occurred suspicious sessions.\nSuch processing activity may be deemed as generating a profile of the End-User.\nResults of such analysis are displayed to the Client.</p>\n<p>\n</p>7.\nData Subject\u2019s rights in relation to Personal
