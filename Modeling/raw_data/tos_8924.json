object code form (without making any modification thereto) strictly in accordance with the Service Agreement.\nThis license will commence upon your acceptance of the relevant Services and will terminate immediately upon the termination of the Services for any reason.\nTDS and its licensors retain all rights and interests in and to any such software of firmware.\nYou acknowledge and understand that you are not granted any other license to use the firmware or software embedded in the TDS Equipment or used to provide the Services.&nbsp.\nYou are permitted to archive the software or re-load the software disk in its original format.\nAll such copies must contain the same copyright notices and proprietary markings as the original software.\nYou shall not reverse compile, disassemble, or reverse engineer or otherwise attempt to derive the source code from the binary code of the firmware or software.\nIf you decide to use the Services through an interface device not

Services, including all software and firmware licenses.\nYou will indemnify and hold harmless TDS against any and all liability arising out of your use of such interface device with the Services.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>3.10.\nCustomer Equipment</b>\n</p>\n<p>Any customer-owned or provided equipment that you use in connection with the Services (\u201c<b>Customer

early termination charges, you must continue to pay for the WPP even during periods that your Services are suspended.</p>\n<p>11.5.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>What Wiring is Covered</u>? The WPP covers all wiring starting at the demarcation point and ending at the telephone jack, internet modem, or video receiver (e.g., set-top box) in your home (collectively, \u201c<b>Covered Wiring</b>\u201d).\nDepending on what type of facilities are installed on your property, the demarcation point is the gateway, the wall-mounted network interface device (NID) on the outside of your home, or the optical network terminal (ONT).&nbsp.\nIf you live in a building with multiple dwelling units such as an apartment building, condominium complex, dormitory, co-op, etc.\n(an

wire;</p>\n<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rewiring after catastrophic events like fires, floods, earthquakes, explosions, etc.;</p>\n<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;Intentional damage;</p>\n<p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;Illegally-installed wiring;</p>\n<p>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wall fishing or wall punching;</p>\n<p>h.&nbsp;&nbsp;Conditions that already existed at the time you subscribed to the WPP;</p>\n<p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;New jacks, first-time

problem with your TDS Service(s), TDS will send a technician out to your home to investigate.\nIf TDS\u2019 investigation confirms that there is a problem with your Covered Wiring that is covered by the WPP, TDS will repair the problem at no cost to you.\nIf you are not enrolled in the WPP, TDS will charge you on a time and materials basis for all diagnostic and repair work performed.\nTDS will perform all work in a manner that is consistent with generally accepted industry standards.</p>\n<p>11.5.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Suspension or termination of the WPP</u>.\nTDS may immediately, and without prior notice, suspend or discontinue your WPP if (a) TDS is no longer providing video, internet or phone service to you.\n(b) any misuse or abuse of the Services occurs.\nor (c) a hazard or danger to person or property exists that would prevent TDS\u2019 technicians from performing the work in a safe manner.\nSubject to applicable law, TDS may discontinue the WPP or modify any of these terms and conditions at any time in its sole discretion.\nTDS will provide 30 days' prior written notice of any material changes in the terms and conditions governing the WPP.\nThis notice may be included in your monthly bill.</p>\n<p>11.5.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Limitation of liability</u>.\nTDS shall not be liable for any injuries to persons or property arising out of installation, maintenance, repair or any other work performed in connection with the WPP.\nFurther, TDS shall not be liable for any other damages arising from your use or inability to use your inside wiring, whether covered by WPP or otherwise, including, but not limited to, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>11.6.\nVideo Services</b>\n</p>\n<p>11.6.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Programming

reside, in order to receive adult-oriented programming services.</p>\n<p>11.6.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Set-top boxes</u>.\nSome models of TV receivers or videocassette recorders may not be able to receive all of the channels offered on TDS\u2019 system.\nChannel compatibility problems may occur if equipment like TVs and VCRs are connected directly to the cable system.\nUse of a set-top box typically resolves these problems.\nChannel compatibility problems associated with the reception of programming that is not scrambled or encrypted programming can be resolved by using a simple converter device without descrambling or decryption capabilities.\nConverters are available from TDS and may be available from retail outlets in some areas.\nIf your service is received through a set-top box, you may not be able to use special features and functions on TVs and VCRs.\nFor example, some set-top boxes may not be compatible with TV or VCR features that allow you to view a program on one channel while simultaneously recording a program on another channel.\nrecord two or more consecutive programs that appear on different channels.\nor use advanced picture generation and display features such as \u201cPicture-in-Picture.\u201d</p>\n<p>11.6.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Additional set-top boxes</u>.\nTo independently tune additional televisions or broadcast devices, a separate set-top box is required for each television.\nEach additional set-top box will be authorized to receive the same Services as your initial receiver.\nIf you desire to receive Services at two different locations, you must open a separate account for each location.</p>\n<p>11.6.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Remote control devices</u>.\nRemote control devices available from retail outlets may be compatible with set-top boxes available from TDS.\nA list of models of remote control devices that are compatible with TDS\u2019 set-top boxes are listed at www.hellotds.com.</p>\n<p>11.6.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>CableCARDs</u>.\nYou may rent a

information that we maintain related to our subscribers only when it is necessary to render services to you, or to carry out related activities in the ordinary course of business for our ordinary business purposes, at a frequency that varies in accordance with the particular business need.\nWe may provide, where permitted by applicable law, aggregated information that does not identify individuals to third parties.</p>\n<p>We sometimes work with Affiliates, service providers, vendors, partners or other companies to help us in providing and/or developing our services and to market new services to you and may share some of your personally identifiable information with such parties for these purposes.\nWe require all parties to assure at least the level of confidentiality we

information for marketing purposes, please contact us by calling the customer service number listed on your bill.</p>\n<p>We may provide your name and address to marketing organizations, programmers and other businesses.\nSection 631 of the federal Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, as amended, (the \u201cCable Act\u201d) allows us to disclose this \u201cmailing list\u201d information unless you tell us otherwise.\nWe may also use or disclose customer information, including personally identifiable information, without your consent, to protect the safety and security of our customers, employees, or property (including in emergency situations), to protect or defend the legal rights or property of TDS or its Affiliates or their employees, agents and contractors (including

information as described above, we may sometimes disclose such information to our Affiliates, agents, contractors, outside auditors, professional advisors, service providers and vendors, or in connection with a potential business merger or acquisition, or to sale partners, and to regulators.\nIf a new company were to take ownership of our cable system, we reserve the right to disclose and transfer all customer information, including personally identifiable information, to the successor company.</p>\n<p>We describe above when we disclose to third parties anonymous customer information relating to our Cable Television services and disclosures associated with other-party services.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Special Exceptions.</b> We reserve the right to disclose your information if we have a good

activity.</li>\n<li>Enforce our policies, including those contained in our Terms of Service, Internet Network Management Policy, and Acceptable Use Policy.</li>\n<li>Transfer your information as a

Preferences.\n</b>Our Telephone service customers can designate their listings as published, non-published or non-listed for published directories or for directory assistance services.\nTo carry out your decision to have a published number, we share information with directory listing vendors.\nTDS cannot remove customer information from, or correct errors in customer names, addresses, or telephone numbers appearing in, or omitted from, directory lists until the next available publication of those directory lists.\nFurther, we may have no control over information appearing in the directory lists or directory assistance services of directory publishers or directory assistance providers which are not owned by us.\nBecause of the complexity of this process and the involvement of others, errors sometimes occur.\nIf you elected to have your information published in directories, that information becomes public and may be used by others for their own marketing or to create marketing lists.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI).</b> Federal law regulates CPNI.\nCPNI includes information that relates to the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, and amount of use of a telecommunications service that we receive solely as a result of our provision of Telephone service to you.\nIn particular, this includes information

access to customer communications to law enforcement or others, except to the extent we are required to do so in the \u201cSpecial Exceptions\u201d section above or detailed below.\nDepending on the violation of law alleged and the legal process undertaken, you may not always be entitled to receive notice that your personally identifiable information has been disclosed to the government or civil litigants.\nIn particular, some law enforcement requests specifically prohibit TDS from disclosing the request or notifying you that we have received it.\nDue to this fact and the volume of requests we receive, we do not assume any duty to notify you of receipt of any legal requests for your personally identifiable information.</p>\n<p>\n<b>For Cable Television Service Subscribers</b>.\nWe must disclose customer information, including personally identifiable information, when required by the terms of a valid legal process such as a subpoena, court order, or search warrant.\nIf a court order requires us to disclose personally identifiable information to a third party, we are required to notify you.\nIf you subscribe to our Cable Television service, under federal law, you must be afforded the opportunity to appear and contest the order in court.\nIn addition, in accordance with the United States of America Patriot Act of 2001, we may be required to disclose personally identifiable information to law enforcement officials in accordance with both court orders and subpoenas.\nhowever, we may not disclose records revealing your selection of video programming.\nYou may not be entitled by law to prior notice or the opportunity to contest these disclosures.</p>\n<p>\n<b>For TDS Internet or TDS Telephone Service Subscribers.</b> If you subscribe to our Internet or Telephone services, the same requirements do not apply.\nInstead, in some instances we may disclose personally identifiable information and CPNI about you to representatives of government or to comply with a court order without your consent and without advance or any notice to you, except that in these cases our disclosure is not to include records revealing your selection of video programming.</p>\n<p>In other instances, we may be required to provide information in order to comply with applicable laws.\nFor example, we are required to notify the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children of information about child pornography that we become aware of in the course of providing our services.\nThis information may be provided without a court order, and we do not have to give you notice and the opportunity to contest such disclosure.</p>\n<p>If we notify you of specific legal requests or orders for personally identifiable information, and there is an opportunity for you to object to such disclosures, it is then up to you to object or take specific action to prevent these disclosures.</p>\n<p>\n<b>F.\nCan I Prohibit TDS\u2019s Use and Disclosure of My Customer Information?</b> You have some choices in how we use or disclose personally identifiable information.\nIf you do not want us to disclose your name and address to third parties for mailing lists in connection with the promotion
