information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</em>\n<br>\n<em>\n<strong>\n<u>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</u>\n</strong>\n</em>\n<br>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information.\nAs such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Consent.&nbsp;</strong>We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose.\nYou can withdraw your consent at any time.\nLearn more about&nbsp;withdrawing your

including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms.\nFor example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Develop and display personalized and relevant advertising content for our users</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them to

exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.<br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<strong>\n<u>\n<em>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</em>\n</u>\n</strong>\n<br>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent).\nYou can&nbsp;withdraw your consent&nbsp;at any time.<br>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:<ul>\n<li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the

resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.\nYOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.\nThe arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") and, where appropriate, the AAA\u2019s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (\"AAA Consumer Rules\"), both of which are available at the American Arbitration Association (AAA) website.\nYour arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.\nIf such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.\nThe arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online.\nThe arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party.\nThe arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.\nExcept where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in Williamson, Texas.\nExcept as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.<br>If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the&nbsp;state and federal courts&nbsp;located in Williamson, Texas, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.\nApplication of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Legal Terms.<br>In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Services be commenced more than one (1) years after the cause of action arose.\nIf this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.<br>\n<strong>Restrictions</strong>\n<br>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually.\nTo the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding.\n(b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures.\nand (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.<br>\n<strong>Exceptions to Arbitration</strong>\n<br>The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party.\n(b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use.\nand (c) any claim for injunctive relief.\nIf this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.<br>\n<strong>\n<strong>\n<strong>\n<strong>17.</strong>\n</strong>&nbsp;</strong>CORRECTIONS</strong>\n<br>There may be information on the Services that
