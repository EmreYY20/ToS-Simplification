personal data, you also have the right to complain to the relevant Supervisory Authority.\nIn the UK this is the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO).\nThey can be contacted at:</p>

credit decisions Credit reference\n<p>When you apply for an insurance or car finance quote through our website, a number of credit checks or other searches may be made through credit reference agencies, fraud prevention agencies or other public or privately available sources of information.\nFor insurance products these checks may be processed by any provider at any stage of a quote, a policy renewal or in certain circumstances where an amendment to your agreement is requested.\nFor car finance products the credit check will be processed by Confused.com and the results may be shared with any lender on our panel.\nFurther credit checks may be made by your selected provider when you apply.</p>\n<p>Credit checks are made to ensure providers have the necessary facts to assess your insurance and financial profile, verify your identity, to help prevent fraud and to provide you with their best premium and payment options.\nThis is normally a \u2018soft\u2019 credit check from a credit referencing agency.\nSoft credit checks allow you to get quotes without affecting your credit rating.\nThey're visible on your credit report but don't show up in the same way as a 'hard' check.\nIf you apply for a loan or other form of credit, a \u2018hard\u2019 check will then be recorded against your credit file.\nThis may affect your credit score, so you may wish to keep full applications to a minimum to protect your credit rating.</p>\n<p>Your full credit report won't be provided to you directly, and won't be made available to ourselves.\nIf you want to access your credit report, you can contact the credit reference agencies currently operating in the UK.\nThe information they hold may not be the same so it's worth contacting them all.\nThey'll charge you a small fee.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transunion: Consumer Services Team, PO Box 491, Leeds, LS3 1WZ or call 0330 024 7574 or log on to www.transunion.co.uk.</li>\n<li>Equifax: Customer Service Centre, PO Box 10036,

prevention agencies, our Rewards partner, and other ZPG Companies may at any time share information about you with members of Confused.com.</p>\n<p>Also, Confused.com actively monitor information entered into our website and pass on intelligence of suspected fraud to the group named above.</p>\n<p>Data may be shared for the following purposes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>checking details on applications for credit and credit related or other facilities</li>\n<li>managing credit and credit related accounts or facilities</li>\n<li>recovering debt</li>\n<li>checking details on proposals and claims for all types of Insurance</li>\n<li>checking details on applications for Confused.com Rewards</li>\n<li>checking details of job applicants and employees</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This may result in Confused.com not being able to offer a product or Confused.com Reward, or insurers not being able to offer a product or offering a product on different terms.</p>\n<p>In addition, Insurance providers exchange information through various databases to help check information provided and to prevent fraudulent claims.\nSpecifically, Insurance Database Services Limited (IDSL) hosts the Claims and Underwriting Exchange (CUE), which holds a record of incidents reported to insurance companies by policyholders and third-party claimants.\nInsurers may validate the information provided by you, both about yourself and about any other person named on the application, against the information held on CUE and against other databases hosted by IDSL.\nInsurers may use this information to consider whether to accept the risk.</p>\n<p>Insurance providers may also use the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register, run by the Association of British Insurers (ABI).\nThis is accessed by the police, the DVLA and DVLNI (Driver &amp.\nVehicle Licensing Agencies), as well as other insurers.\nSome insurers also participate in other data-sharing schemes.</p>\n<p>When you get a motor insurance policy, including motorbike or van cover, your insurance cover details may also be added to the Motor Insurance Database, run by the Motor Insurers' Information Centre (MIIC).\nThis has been set up to help identify uninsured drivers and may be searched by the police to help them confirm who's insured to drive.\nIf there's an accident the database may be used by insurers, MIIC and the Motor Insurers' Bureau as well as those making a claim for a road traffic accident, to identify the relevant policy information.</p>\n<p>The aim of all of this is to help Confused.com, our product providers and our Rewards partner to decide if they can offer a product, offer a product on different terms and to prevent fraudulent claims.\nWhen we deal with your request for a quote, if applicable, the insurance provider or any intermediary or appointed representative may search these registers, databases and any other anti-fraud registers to provide such services.\nUnder the conditions of your policy, you must tell us about any incident (such as accident, damage, loss or theft) which may or may not give rise to a claim.\nWhen you tell us about an incident we'll pass information relating to it, to the insurance provider, intermediary or appointed representative.</p>\n<p>Failure to answer all questions honestly, accurately and to the best of your knowledge may result in any policy or product being invalid, receiving extra charges from your chosen provider, or seeing any future claim being affected.\nYou may also be liable for any third party costs in the event of an accident.</p> Changes to this policy
