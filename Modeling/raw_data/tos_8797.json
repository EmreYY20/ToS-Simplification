thing we can all agree on is that when we use the Teachable Platform we are going to be civil and respectful at all times.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.6 No Exploitation:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You will not use the Teachable Platform to try to gather personal information on anyone outside of the limited permissible uses for offering or accessing User Content.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.7 No

also reserves the right to remove from the Platform any Creators, Students, or other parties, who are repeat offenders of the Teachable repeat offender policy.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Reporting Copyright Infringement under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 512) (\"DMCA\"):</strong>\n<br>a) Teachable provides an online form for submitting copyright infringement notices

complies with the DMCA, Teachable will expeditiously remove or disable access to the content alleged to be infringing.<br>c) Please note that when Teachable removes content in response to a DMCA notice, Teachable will attempt to contact the party who posted the content You report as infringing and provide information about the notice and removal, including information about how to submit a

Notice received will be sent to the party who reported the content as infringing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Repeat Infringement Policy:&nbsp;</strong>As we stated above, Teachable really doesn't look favorably on anyone who is using someone else's intellectual property without permission.\nShould Teachable receive two or more DMCA complaints regarding any Creator, Teachable may simply remove that Creator from the Teachable Platform without further warning.\nNote: as we state in our Teachable Rights section, we still reserve the right to remove any school at any time for any reason.\nThis Repeat Infringement section does not change that right in any way.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>6.2.\nTrademark Violations</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Teachable reserves the right to remove access to content that it knows, or has reason to know, violates the rights of trademark owners.\nPlease note that Teachable will send a copy of any trademark infringement claim received to the user who posted

with additional information and materials requested by the form that were not previously submitted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Counter Notice Procedure</strong>\n<br>a) If Your content is removed due to the receipt of a Trademark notice, you may send Teachable a counter notice if you believe that your content was wrongly removed.<br>b) If Teachable receives a counter notice that denies the infringement claim and asserts that it has a good faith basis for doing so, Teachable may choose not to remove the allegedly infringing content but will put you in contact with the user so that you and the user can address the matter directly.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<strong>7.\nThird Party Communications</strong>\n<p>By using Teachable's Platform, You may receive communications from third parties

Custom Payment Gateways.\nYour use of either type of gateway is covered by the terms of this section.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.1.\nTeachable Native Gateways</strong>\n</p>\n<p>For the avoidance of doubt, the term Teachable Native Gateways is a reference to both Teachable Payments and the Monthly Payments Gateway.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Appointment of Teachable as a Limited Payment Collection Agent for Teachable Native Gateways:&nbsp;</strong>Each Creator collecting payment for services provided on the Teachable platform via Teachable Native Gateways hereby appoints Teachable as the Creator's payment collection agent solely for the limited purpose of accepting funds from Students purchasing such services.<br>a) Each Creator agrees that payment made by a Student through the Teachable Native Gateways shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the Creator, and the Creator will provide the purchased services to the Student in the agreed manner as if the Creator has received the payment directly from the Student.\nEach Creator agrees that Teachable may refund the Student in accordance with the Terms.\nEach Creator understands that Teachable's obligation to pay the Creator is subject to and conditional upon successful receipt of the associated payments from Students.\nTeachable guarantees payments to Creators only for such amounts that have been successfully received by Teachable from Students in accordance with these Terms.\nIn accepting appointment as the limited payment collection agent of the Creator, Teachable assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Creator.<br>b) Each Student acknowledges and agrees that Teachable acts as the Creator's payment collection agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the Creator.\nUpon payment of the funds to Teachable, the Student's payment obligation to the Creator for the agreed amount is extinguished, and Teachable is responsible for remitting the funds to the Creator in the manner described in these Terms, which constitute Teachable's agreement with the Student.\nIn the event that Teachable does not remit any such amounts once successfully received from the Student, the Creator will have recourse only against Teachable and not the Student directly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Teachable Payments:&nbsp;</strong>The Teachable Payments gateway allows Creators to process credit or debit card transactions and facilitates faster payout processes.\nTeachable Payments is available to some Creators, based on location.\nFor a list of eligible locations, please see the Teachable website.<br>a) Creators have the option to set up Teachable Payments from their school's Admin page.\nBy setting up Teachable Payments, You agree to the terms that appear in these Terms and/or on the Teachable Platform regarding the Teachable Payments Gateway.<br>b) Third Party Agreement: In setting up Teachable Payments, You may be instructed to agree to terms of service offered by Stripe.\nStripe is an independent party from Teachable and Teachable is not responsible for the contents of their terms of service.\nShould Stripe's terms of service differ from these Terms, such differences shall not modify these Terms in any manner.<br>c) By using Teachable Payments You agree that Teachable may place a portion of Your school sales in reserve for a period of time to cover losses, chargebacks, refunds, etc.\nThe current reserve period and amount are located on our&nbsp;Knowledge Base&nbsp;page regarding Teachable Payments.\nThe amount of reserves and the length of time in which they are held are subject to change at Teachable's sole discretion.\nShould the reserve period or the amount withheld change, Teachable will make reasonable efforts to update the Knowledge Base page to communicate these changes.<br>d) Fees for Teachable Payments may be found on the Teachable&nbsp;Knowledge Base&nbsp;page.\nAll Teachable Payment gateway fees will be deducted before the funds are sent to the Creator.\nThe fees associated with Teachable Payments are subject to change, in Teachable's sole discretion.\nBy using Teachable Payments, You agree to the fees as set by Teachable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Monthly Payment Gateway:&nbsp;</strong>Teachable Creators may also have an opportunity to utilize the Monthly Payments Gateway (MPG) to facilitate credit card or debit card transactions or to utilize PayPal as a payment option.\nMPG is offered wherever PayPal accounts are available and the availability of MPG is subject to any limitations by PayPal.\nTeachable Payments users will only be able to utilize MPG for PayPal transactions and will not be able to utilize MPG for credit card processing.<br>a) Third Party Agreement: In setting up MPG, You may need to agree to terms of service offered by Stripe or PayPal.\nStripe and PayPal are independent parties from Teachable and Teachable is not responsible for the contents of their terms of service.\nShould their terms of service differ from these Terms, such differences shall not modify these Terms in any manner.<br>b) Funds paid out to Creators via MPG are paid on the first of the month (or first available business day) no earlier than thirty (30) days after the end of the month in which a sale was made.\nThis hold period is to account for any potential losses, chargebacks, refunds, etc.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this hold may result in funds being paid out more than thirty (30) days after the sale to a Student.\nThe current hold period can be located on our&nbsp;Knowledge Base&nbsp;page regarding MPG.\nThe length of time in which MPG funds are held before payout is subject to change at Teachable's sole discretion.\nShould the hold period change, Teachable will make reasonable efforts to communicate these changes via the Knowledge Base page.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>10.2.\nCustom Payments Gateway:</strong>&nbsp;Creators on the Professional, Business, and Enterprise plans may choose to set up a Custom Payment Gateway (CPG) to process Student transactions.\nThese transactions, which are made through a third-party payment gateway, are outside of the scope of your relationship with Teachable.\nYou agree that Your CPG service is a third-party payment service and is not a part of the Teachable Services.\nPayouts are distributed according to the third-party payment service's policies and procedures, and are not subject to any of Teachable\u2019s policies and procedures related to payments, including the 30-day refund policy or payment hold.\nFurthermore, You acknowledge that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Transactions.\nmade through CPG are not subject to Teachable's transaction fees.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Teachable does not control any payment processing fees that may be assessed through CPG.\nAdditionally, while Teachable may record the amounts that you owe to authors and affiliates in the transaction report, Teachable does not have the access or ability to make deductions from transaction fees processed through third-party payment gateways to pay your authors or affiliates.\nCreators using CPG are responsible for making payments to authors and affiliates on their own.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Teachable is not a marketplace facilitator with respect to any transactions that occur through CPG.\nBy using CPG, You further acknowledge that Teachable does not have any responsibility to pay, remit, or otherwise collect or send to any relevant tax authorities any taxes owed, including sales taxes, on Creator Content you sell through CPG.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>10.3 Chargebacks</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Creators may be charged a fee for any chargeback on credit card, debit card, or PayPal transaction that is processed through the Teachable Native Gateways.\nThis fee is deducted from Your school's payout but is returned to You if You win the dispute.\nCurrent fees may be found on the&nbsp;Teachable Knowledge Base.\nFees are subject to change.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.4 Negative Balance Collections</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Under certain circumstances including, without limitation, refunds and chargebacks, You may incur negative balances on Your Account.\nIn the event that You are unable to resolve such negative balances directly with Teachable within a time period determined solely by Teachable in adherence with the Federal Debt Collections Practice Act and other applicable laws, You hereby permit Teachable to appoint a collections agency solely for the limited purpose of collecting such negative balances on Your Account.\nYou agree to pay all costs and expenses including, without limitation, attorneys\u2019 fees, legal expenses, collections agency fees, and other collections fees, incurred by or on behalf of Teachable in connection with the collection of any amounts due to Teachable under these Terms that are unpaid by You.</p>\n<strong>11.\nTaxes</strong>\n<p>Laws governing the collection, reporting and remittance of sales and use taxes, value-added taxes and other similar state, local and foreign taxes are complex.\nThis section of the Terms summarizes Teachable\u2019s practices regarding these tax requirements.\nPlease be advised that Teachable\u2019s position on these tax matters is subject to change, without notice, and possibly with retroactive effect.</p>\n<p>Depending on the laws of the relevant jurisdictions, Creator Content sold by Creators to Students through the Teachable platform for purchases of courses and other services and transmitted to locations inside and outside of the United States may be subject to tax.</p>\n<p>The rate and amount of tax imposed depends on a number of factors which Teachable considers, including (without limitation):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The identity of the Creator and/or Student;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The type of course or service that was purchased, and whether or not is it taxable;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The payment gateway used by the Creator (Teachable Native Gateways vs.\nCustom Payments Gateways).\nand</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The shipment or delivery address of the Creator or Student, as applicable.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Teachable may request additional information from its customers, which will require You to provide certain information, such as Your legal name, tax identification number, address, phone number, e-mail address, and account information for Your bank account, as necessary to fulfill its tax obligations.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.1 General Application of Sales Taxes in the United States</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Teachable will determine whether a transaction on the Teachable Platform is subject to tax based on the applicable laws in each state.\nTeachable will calculate, collect, report and remit any sales taxes collected directly to the state on whose behalf the tax is imposed.\nCertain states may also require the Creator to submit their own tax filings or information returns.</p>\n<p>The tax rate applied to Your transaction will be equal to the combined applicable state and local tax rate which shall be determined by Teachable based on the information provided by the Creator and/or Student, as applicable.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Fees from Teachable Subscription Plans</strong>\n<br>Where applicable, Teachable will collect from the Creator sales tax that may arise in connection with Teachable subscription fees.<br>Creators who believe that they should not be charged tax in connection to Teachable subscription fees must provide Teachable with a valid tax/identification number, a valid tax ID/tax certificate or other documentary proof issued by an appropriate taxing authority confirming that Teachable should not charge tax to the Creator in accordance with the applicable tax laws.<br>Please note that in some situations, tax laws may require the Creator to report and remit tax itself to its tax authority with regard to subscription fees paid to Teachable (these situations are commonly referred to as 'reverse charge').</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Fees from the sale of Creator Content</strong>\n<br>For United States sales tax purposes, Teachable may be deemed to be a \u201cmarketplace facilitator\u201d for third-party sales transacted through Teachable\u2019s Native Payment Gateways.\nA \u201cmarketplace facilitator\u201d is generally defined as the entity that owns or operates the marketplace (platform), and directly or indirectly processes transactions (including the sale of physical property, digital goods and services) on behalf of third-party sellers (\u201cmarketplace sellers\u201d).<br>In the United States, marketplace facilitator laws and regulations shift the sales tax collection, reporting and remittance obligations from marketplace sellers to the marketplace facilitator.\nTherefore, where Teachable is deemed a marketplace facilitator, Teachable is responsible for calculating, collecting, remitting and refunding sales taxes on taxable products and services that are sold over Teachable\u2019s Native Payment Gateways (i.e.\nTeachable Payments and Monthly Payment Gateway).<br>Please note that where a Creator is using the Custom Payment Gateway (CPG), the Creator is solely responsible for calculating, collecting, reporting and remitting sales tax regardless of the Student\u2019s state of residence.<br>Creators are able to download sales reports detailing the purchase amount and the amount of tax collected on each sale through their account dashboard.<br>It is possible that certain states will require additional marketplace facilitator collection (\u201cMarketplace Facilitator Collection\u201d) under new or existing laws.\nAt its sole discretion, Teachable shall determine when it will undertake Marketplace Facilitator Collection with respect to a jurisdiction and You authorize Teachable to take all actions necessary to undertake such Marketplace Facilitator Collection.\nYou agree to reasonably cooperate with Teachable and timely provide all information necessary for Teachable to accurately calculate, collect, report and remit such taxes including, but not limiting to, complying with the other provisions of this section.\nTeachable shall have sole discretion to specify the rate and taxability applied to the products and services sold.\nYou also understand and agree that Teachable may undertake Marketplace Facilitator Collection for transactions in jurisdictions in which you do not otherwise have a substantial nexus.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, You understand and agree that Teachable will not remit to You any taxes collected as part of Marketplace Facilitator Collection.\nWithout limiting Your obligations or liability under any other provision of these Terms, You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Teachable for any taxes, penalties, or interest on Your transactions asserted against Teachable by a jurisdiction with respect to Marketplace Facilitator Collection.<br>Please refer to Teachable\u2019s Knowledge Base article on United States Sales Tax and Teachable for a list of jurisdictions where Teachable collects tax as a marketplace facilitator.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Exceptions</strong>\n<br>Teachable will not collect sales taxes in the following circumstances:<br>\n<strong>Creator sales over Custom Payment Gateway (CPG):&nbsp;</strong>Creators must calculate, collect, report and remit taxes themselves<br>\n<strong>Creator sales off Platform:&nbsp;</strong>Creators must calculate, collect, report and remit taxes themselves<br>\n<strong>Tax Exempt Organization:&nbsp;</strong>Creators or Students from tax-exempt organizations who purchase products or services on the Teachable platform will be required to pay sales taxes on the initial purchase.\nThereafter, the Creator or Student should submit a refund request to tax@teachable.com.\nThe refund request should include a copy of the purchase receipt showing the sales tax paid and the Order ID, as well as a copy of the Creator or Student\u2019s valid tax/identification number, a valid tax ID/tax certificate or other documentary proof issued by an appropriate taxing authority confirming that Teachable should not charge tax to the Creator in accordance with the applicable tax laws.\nTeachable will issue a refund once the documentation has been reviewed and approved.<br>\n<strong>Resellers:&nbsp;</strong>Creator will need to provide Teachable with a tax exemption certificate issued by the state in which they are located.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Additional Sales Tax Considerations</strong>\n<br>Teachable\u2019s failure to collect, report and remit taxes to any governmental authority, may not relieve the Creator or Student from its sales tax obligations or liabilities within a state where applicable products and services are taxable.\nIn certain states, a marketplace seller is still responsible for collecting and remitting sales and use taxes on sales not made on the marketplace facilitator platform.\nAdditionally, the marketplace seller may remain liable for the sales tax if the marketplace facilitator can demonstrate that: (i) it has made a reasonable effort to obtain accurate and complete information from an unrelated marketplace seller about a retail sale, and (ii) the failure to remit the correct amount of tax was due to incorrect or incomplete information provided to the marketplace facilitator by the unrelated marketplace seller.\nWE ADVISE EACH CREATOR AND/OR STUDENT TO CONSULT WITH ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE APPLICABILITY OF THESE RULES TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>11.2 General Application of Taxes Outside of the United States</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Creator and Student expressly acknowledge that an agreement is formed directly between Creator and Student for the sale of Creator Content by the Creator to the Student.\nTeachable is not a party to that agreement nor sets any of the terms for Creator Content sold by the Creator to the Student.</p>\n<p>The Creator is the supplier of the Creator Content, Teachable is not responsible for interactions between Creators and Students and only provides technical means through which Creators may make their Creator Content available to Students.</p>\n<p>As the Creator sells its Creator Content directly to the Student under its agreement with the Student, except as expressly provided in these Terms, the Creator will be solely and fully responsible to collect, report and remit the correct amount of tax (if any) to tax authorities for charges to the Students for the purchase of Creator Content.\nTeachable recommends Creators consult a tax advisor to assist with determining the tax requirements relating to the sale of their Creator Content.</p>\n<p>Some countries provide for special tax laws making Teachable instead of the Creator responsible for the tax obligations pertaining to Creator Content sold by Creators while using the Teachable Native Gateways (Teachable Payments and Monthly Payment Gateway).\nIn this regard, please note that the tax laws of the countries where Students reside generally dictate whether such a special tax law applies making Teachable instead of the Creator responsible for tax.</p>\n<p>Therefore, in the event a Creator sells Creator Content to Students in multiple countries, different tax obligations may apply for the Creator, depending on the countries where the individual Students reside.</p>\n<p>Please note that where a Creator is using the Custom Payment Gateway (CPG), the Creator is always solely responsible for tax, regardless of the country of residence of the Student.</p>\n<p>The Country-Specific Guidance section contains an overview of jurisdictions where tax laws apply that shift the tax obligations for Creator Content from the Creator to Teachable in the Teachable Native Gateways model due to a deemed (by way of legal fiction) resale of Creator Content by Teachable that applies for tax purposes only.</p>\n<p>Teachable determines the country where a Student resides for tax purposes on the basis of information the Student enters at checkout.\nWhere needed, Teachable makes such data available to the Creator to enable the Creator to determine the amount of tax on the sale of Creator Content to a Student for which the Creator is responsible.</p>\n<p>For information around requesting refunds and exemptions, please refer to Section 2 of the Terms of Use -&nbsp;Annex</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Country Specific Guidance</strong>\n<br>Please note that Teachable is handling tax on Creator Content sold to students only in specific situations, summarized below by country.\nIn all other situations, the creator is solely responsible for tax on Creator Content and should consult with their tax advisor.<br>For further country-specific guidance, please also refer to the Knowledge based article on&nbsp;Digital Content Tax Handling Outside Europe and the United States.<br>\n<strong>a)</strong>&nbsp;<strong>European Union Value Added Tax (EU VAT)</strong>\n<br>For Creator Content sold to Students residing in the EU, Teachable is responsible for collecting, reporting and remitting EU VAT to tax authorities if:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Creator sells the Creator Content while using the Teachable Native Gateways.\nand</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Creator Content is an 'Electronically Supplied Service' (ESS).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>User Content is an ESS unless the Creator has expressly confirmed, by disabling the EU VAT feature on the Teachable platform, that the Content requires live interaction between Creator and Student.\nFor more information on EU VAT and the respective responsibilities of Creators and Teachable, please refer to Section 1 of the Terms of Use -&nbsp;Annex.<br>\n<strong>b) AUSTRALIA, CANADA, CHILE, KENYA, MOLDOVA, NEW ZEALAND, RUSSIA, SAUDI ARABIA, and TAIWAN</strong>\n<br>For Creator Content sold by Creators to Students residing in Australia, Canada, Chile, Kenya, Moldova, New Zealand, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Taiwan, Teachable is responsible for collecting, reporting and remitting tax to tax authorities if:<br>(i) the Creator is not established in or residing in the country of the Student, and<br>(ii) the Creator sells Creator Content while using the Teachable Native Gateways.<br>Students located in Australia, Canada, Chile, Kenya, Moldova, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia and Taiwan with a valid tax ID will not be charged tax at checkout.<br>\n<strong>c) MEXICO</strong>\n<br>For Creator Content sold by Creators to Students residing in Mexico, Teachable collects, reports and remits the full general VAT rate to tax authorities in Mexico unless:<br>(i) a Mexico-resident Creator provides Teachable with a valid 13-digit Mexican Tax ID number (\"RFC\") for individuals.\nIn this case, Teachable remits 50% of the VAT amount to the tax authorities;<br>(ii) a Mexico-resident Creator provides Teachable with a valid 12-digit Mexican Tax ID number (\"RFC\") for business entities.\nIn this case, Teachable does not remit VAT to the tax authorities.<br>\n<strong>d) INDIA, SINGAPORE, AND MALAYSIA</strong>\n<br>For Creator Content sold by Creators to Students residing in India, Singapore and Malaysia, Teachable is responsible for collecting, reporting and remitting tax to tax authorities if:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the Creator is not established in or residing in the country of the Student;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the Creator sells the Creator Content while using the Teachable Native Gateways.\nand</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the Creator Content is an 'Electronically Supplied Service' (ESS) or equivalent under the applicable tax laws.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Creator Content is an ESS&nbsp;<strong>unless&nbsp;</strong>the Creator has expressly confirmed, by turning on the Comment Box functionality when creating its course on the Teachable platform, that the Creator Content requires live interaction between Creator and Student.<br>Please note that in cases where Creator Content is&nbsp;<strong>NOT ESS,&nbsp;</strong>Teachable will&nbsp;<strong>NEVER&nbsp;</strong>be responsible for tax for Creator Content sold by Creators.\nThis means that the Creators will in those cases be responsible for tax on the Creator Content.<br>Students located in India and Singapore with a valid tax ID will not be charged tax at checkout.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>11.3 Tax Indemnification</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, You shall indemnify, defend and hold Teachable and our affiliates and their respective officers, directors, agents and employees harmless from and against all claims, demands, suits or other proceedings, and resulting loss, damage, liability, costs, interest and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) brought by any third party or governmental claim or demand that involves, relates to or concerns federal, state, county, city, foreign or other tax obligation or amounts due or owing under any tax regulation, law, order or decree.\nWe reserve, and You grant to us, the right to assume exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by You hereunder.\nAll rights and duties of indemnification that are set forth herein shall survive termination of these Terms.</p>\n<strong>12.\nTeachable Subscription Fees</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Teachable Plans are billed on a subscription basis.\nUsers who sign up for a paid Teachable Plan will be billed in advance on either a monthly or annual cycle, depending on what Teachable Plan was selected at time of purchase.\nPayment will be charged to the User\u2019s chosen payment method at confirmation of purchase and at the beginning of each new billing cycle.\nTeachable Plans will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless You submit a cancellation request to us in writing via email (support@teachable.com) or directly through Your account prior to the end of the billing cycle.\nUpon cancellation, your access to the select Teachable Plan will terminate and you will not be charged for the next billing cycle.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pricing for the purchase of a Teachable Plan is described on our pricing page.\nTeachable may change the price of a Teachable Plan from time to time and will communicate any price changes to You in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes for Teachable Plan subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nIf You do not agree with the price Teachable charges, You have the right to reject the change by canceling Your subscription before the price change goes into

agree to pay all fees and charges that are made to Your account and that You are solely responsible for payment of these fees and charges.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Should You not authorize payment or are otherwise not current on Your payments for Teachable Services, Teachable may restrict Your Platform access until Your account becomes current and paid in full.\nTeachable reserves the right to pursue fees owed using collection methods which may include charging other payment methods on file with Teachable and/or retaining collection agencies or legal counsel.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Teachable reserves the right to offer custom Teachable plans and pricing in addition to what is offered on the pricing page.\nCustom Teachable plans may also include custom billing and payment terms, including billing periods and renewals, that are different from our standard terms.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<strong>13.\nPricing of Creator Content</strong>\n<p>Teachable is not responsible for setting the pricing on Creator Content.\nPrices for Creator Content are set by the Creator.</p>\n<strong>14.\nRefund Policy</strong>\n<p>We want You to be happy with Teachable's Platform.\nIf You're not feeling excited
