information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative's Consumer Opt-Out Link and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance's Consumer Opt-Out Link to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs.\nTo opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads, you can visit the Google Ads Settings page.\nPlease note that, to the extent advertising technology is

tailored in-application advertising.\nFor any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact the applicable platform operator.\n</p> Our

your request.\n</p> California Do-Not-Track Disclosure <p> Wag! is committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our Services.\nHowever, Wag! does not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do-Not-Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working on Do-Not-Track standards, implementations and solutions.\n</p> Consent to Transfer <p> Our computer systems are currently based in the United States, so your personal information will be processed by us in the United States, where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world.\nBy using the Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer and processing of all of your information to the United States, which may not offer a level of protection equivalent to that required in the European Union or certain other countries.\n</p> What if I have questions about this policy? <p> If you

account.&nbsp.\nIf your primary payment method is determined to be expired, invalid, or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that Wag! may, as the Pet Care Provider\u2019s limited payment collection agent, use a secondary payment method in your account, if available.\n</p>\n<p> Pet Owners and Pet Care Providers transact with each other on the Wag! marketplace technology platform when they both agree to a \u201cbooking\u201d that specifies the fees, time period, cancellation policy, and other terms for provision of pet care services via the booking mechanism provided on the Wag! marketplace technology platform.&nbsp.\nYou may choose to transact with certain Pet Care Providers from time to time based on a variety of factors in your discretion, such as your desired price range, a Pet Care Provider\u2019s pet service price rate, a Pet Care Provider\u2019s profile, and a Pet Care Provider\u2019s star ratings and reviews.&nbsp.\nOnce you request a pet care service, you agree to pay the Pet Care Provider the agreed-to price and honor the other terms of such booking.&nbsp.\nYou may elect to cancel your request for services from a Pet Care Provider at any time prior to such Pet Care Provider\u2019s arrival, in which case you may be subject to a cancellation fee.\n</p>\n<p> The fees owed to Pet Care Providers are not inclusive of tip or gratuity for the Pet Care Provider.&nbsp.\nWhile you are free to provide gratuity to any Pet Care Provider who provides you with services obtained through the Services, you are under no obligation to do so.&nbsp.\nAfter you have received services or goods obtained through the Services, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your Pet Care Provider.\n</p>\n<p> In addition to the above fees, you understand and acknowledge that you may incur ancillary charges in connection with your receipt of pet care services from Pet Care Providers (\u201cCharges\u201d).\nSuch Charges may include some combination of the following: (1) cancellation fee, (2) service, booking, or platform usage fee, (3) trust and safety fee, (4) surcharges, (5) convenience fee, and (6) other fees.&nbsp.\nA description of any Charges will be available on the Services.&nbsp.\nYou have absolute discretion to request or not request services from a Pet Care Provider if the total applicable fee or charge is not acceptable to you.\n</p>\n<p> From time to time, Wag!

at any time for any reason or no reason without liability to Wag!.\n</p>\n<p> You acknowledge and agree that Wag! may limit or temporarily or permanently suspend your use of or access to the Services if: (1) you have provided inaccurate, fraudulent, outdated, or incomplete information regarding a payment method, (2) any amounts you owe for pet care services are overdue or in default, or (3) Wag!

will be required to pay any cancellation or other fees associated with your early termination and disclosed to you at the time you signed up for the subscription plan.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.3 Payment Authorization</strong>\n</p>\n<p> Upon addition of a new payment method or each pet care service request, Wag! may seek authorization of your selected payment method to verify the payment method, ensure the pet care service charges will be covered, and protect against unauthorized behavior.&nbsp.\nThe authorization is not a charge.\nhowever, it may reduce your available credit by the authorization amount until your bank\u2019s next processing cycle.&nbsp.\nShould the amount of the authorization exceed the total funds on deposit in your account, you may be subject to overdraft of NSF charges by the bank issuing your credit, debit, or prepaid card.&nbsp.\nWag! cannot be held responsible for these charges and are unable to assist you in recovering them from your issuing
