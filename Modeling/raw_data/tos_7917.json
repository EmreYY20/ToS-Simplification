not violate our rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>using jsDelivr is free for both personal and commercial use,</li>\n<li>there are no limits on bandwidth or number of requests,</li>\n<li>we will provide a reasonable level of support via GitHub issues and email for\nurgent and private matters.</li>\n</ul>\n2.\nHard Limits and Restrictions\n<p>To maintain the performance and security of our Service, we have\nvarious limits and restrictions in place.\nThese may include but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>maximum size of a single file,</li>\n<li>maximum number of files in a single package,</li>\n<li>maximum size of a single package,</li>\n<li>blocking of certain file extensions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When requesting a resource that does not meet these limits, you will get an error\nresponse indicating the reason.\nThe limits are set considerably higher than needed\nfor most projects and may be further increased or removed for legitimate projects\non request.</p>\n3.\nSoft Limits and Recommendations\n<p>These limits are not automatically enforced by our Service, but you agree not to\nexceed them:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>For projects using our GitHub proxy:<ul>\n<li>We recommend that the number of actively accessed files per repository\ndoes not exceed 10 000.\nIf you have considerably more files, a custom\nproxy endpoint for your project may be a better fit.</li>\n<li>The soft limit for the number of files per repository is 100 000.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These recommendations are not automatically enforced by our Service, but may\nindicate whether a project falls within the Permitted or the Prohibited use\nwhen it is not immediately clear.\nWe recommend that each project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>has a meaningful name,</li>\n<li>has public documentation and an appropriate license that allows use by other people,</li>\n<li>in case of npm packages, links to a public source code repository,</li>\n<li>does not contain intentionally obfuscated code.</li>\n</ul>\n4.\nProhibited Use\n<p>The following behavior is prohibited:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Hosting or accessing content that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>contains malware or harmful code in any form,</li>\n<li>violates proprietary rights of others,</li>\n<li>is sexually explicit,</li>\n<li>is potentially illegal in the EU or the USA.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Abusing the service and its resources, or using jsDelivr as a general-purpose\nfile or media hosting service.\nThis includes, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>running an image hosting website and using jsDelivr as a storage for all\nuploaded images,</li>\n<li>hosting videos, file backups, or other files in large quantities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We recognize that there are legitimate projects that consist of a large number\nof files, and these are not considered abuse.\nFor example: icons packs, apps,\nor games with a large number of assets.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Trying to bypass our limits or restrictions in any way.\nWe will be happy\nto remove limits or provide custom solutions for legitimate projects.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n5.\nAdditional Restrictions in China\n<p>jsDelivr holds an ICP license issued by the Chinese government,\nwhich allows us to operate infrastructure directly in Mainland China.\nTo keep this license and allow our Chinese users to benefit from the performance\nimprovements it provides, any content served via our Chinese network must conform\nto Chinese policies.\nContent potentially violating Chinese policies may be\nblocked in China without warning.</p>\n6.\nLimitation of Liability\n<p>In no event will the Prospect One and/or jsDelivr entities be liable to you\nor any third party for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential,\nor punitive damages arising out of or relating to your access to or use of,\nor your inability to access or use, the websites and online services or any materials\nor content on the websites and online services, whether based on
