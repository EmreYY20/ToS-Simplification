of which will be communicated to you via the Services.\nIf you decide to stop use of the Paid Services or cancel your Subscription before Lover App starts charging your payment method, you must stop use of the Paid Services or cancel the Subscription before the free trial ends.\nOtherwise, you will be responsible for payment for any further use of the Paid Services or the full term of the Subscription period.</p>\n<p>4.5.\nTaxes.\nLover App\u2019s fees are net of any applicable Sales Tax.\nIf any Services, or payments for any Services, under the Terms are subject to Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax to Lover App, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and you will indemnify Lover App for any liability or expense we may incur in connection with such Sales Taxes.\nUpon our request, you will provide us with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes.\nFor purposes of this section, \u201cSales Tax\u201d shall mean any sales or use tax, and any other tax

Paid Services, including Subscription Services, for any Account for which any amount is due but unpaid.\nIn addition to the amount due for the Paid Services, including Subscription Services, such

arbitration agreement in this Section (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) carefully.\nIt requires you to arbitrate disputes with Lover App and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.</p>\n<p>\u200b</p>\n<p>16.1.\nApplicability of Arbitration Agreement.\nYou agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Services or to any aspect of your relationship with Lover App, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (a) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.\nand (b) you or Lover App may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).\nThis Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the date you accepted the Terms of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>\u200b</p>\n<p>16.2.\nArbitration Rules and Forum.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.\nTo begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent: Jas Bagniewski, 1295 Laurel Hill Drive, San Mateo, CA 94402.\nThe arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the \u201cAAA Rules\u201d) then in effect, except as modified by this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section.\n(The AAA Rules are available by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.\nA party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.\n(The AAA provides a general Demand for Arbitration form and a separate form for Demand for Arbitration for California residents.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA\u2019s roster of arbitrators.\nIf the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.\nUnless you and Lover App Inc otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.\nIf your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Lover App Inc submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.\nIf your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nSubject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>\n<p>\u200b</p>\n<p>16.3.\nDecision of Arbitrator.\nThe arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.\nJudgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.\nThe arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant\u2019s individual claim.\nIf you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.\nLover App Inc will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>\n<p>\u200b</p>\n<p>16.4.\nFees.\nYour responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.\nHowever, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, We will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>\n<p>\u200b</p>\n<p>16.5.\nWaiver of Jury Trial.\nYOU AND LOVER APP HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.\nYou and Lover App are instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 16.1 above.\nAn arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would.\nHowever, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p>\n<p>\u200b</p>\n<p>16.6.\nWaiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief.\nALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.\nIf a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this Section\u2019s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then that claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the State of California.\nAll other claims shall be arbitrated.</p>\n<p>\u200b</p>\n<p>16.7.\n30-Day Right to Opt Out.\nYou have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending an email to support@lover.io within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.\nYour notice must include your name, your Lover App username (if any), the email address you used to set up your Account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.\nIf you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.\nOpting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.</p>\n<p>\u200b</p>\n<p>16.8.\nSeverability.\nExcept as provided in Section 16.5, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p>\n<p>\u200b</p>\n<p>16.9.\nSurvival of Agreement.\nThis Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Lover App.</p>\n<p>\u200b</p>\n<p>16.10.\nModification.\nNotwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Lover App makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by emailing Lover App at support@lover.io.</p>\n<p>\u200b</p> 17.\nGENERAL PROVISIONS.\n\u200b
