obligations we have with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (\u201cICANN\u201d) and with certain TLD registries (\u201cRegistries\u201d) so that you can validly register your domain name.\nIn addition to Personal Information, our contracts with some Registries may require us to collect other personal information for the registration of a TLD such as certain professional affiliations, identification or other qualifiers (\u201cAdditional Personal Information\u201d).</p>Disclosure of Information<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Public Whois.</strong> Our contracts with ICANN and other Registries require us to make certain domain name information (\u201cWHOIS Information\u201d), available and accessible to the public through a WHOIS search as required by ICANN/Registry Policy (the \u201cWHOIS Directory\u201d).\nThe WHOIS Directory is a publicly accessible database that lists WHOIS Information, including a particular domain name, the name server(s) to which the domain name points, and the domain name\u2019s creation and expiration date.\nExcept for EU/EEA natural persons (as described below), your Personal Information could be displayed on the WHOIS Directory.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>EU/EEA natural persons.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, or GDPR, if you are a EU/EEA natural person (as defined by the GDPR), other than as specified in this addendum, our publication of WHOIS Information will not contain any Personal Information.\nAccordingly, we will not display Personal Information of a EU/EEA natural person in the WHOIS Directory.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Transfer Out.</strong> If you initiate a transfer out of a domain name away from us as the registrar of record, pursuant to our contract with ICANN, we may need to publish your registrant email address obtained from your Personal Information in the WHOIS Directory for a period of approximately five (5) calendar days.\nAfter this period and assuming a valid transfer has occurred, you would cease to be our customer for that domain name and your WHOIS Information would be managed by the gaining registrar.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Certain Registries.</strong> Registries are third party providers of TLDs that are independent of domain registrars.\nIf required by contract with a particular Registry, we may be obligated, as a domain registrar of domains provided by the Registry, to provide Personal Information and Additional Personal Information to such Registry to successfully complete your domain name registration.\nIf we provide your Personal Information and Additional Personal Information to a Registry, the Registry has its own obligation to comply with applicable data privacy laws.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Data Escrow.</strong> Our contract with ICANN requires us to deposit the Personal Information collected with a secure third-party escrow provider who acts solely as a holder of the data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Permitted Disclosures.</strong> We may also disclose your Personal Information when required by the rules, regulations and policies of ICANN, including but not limited to the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Last modified September 18, 2019</strong>\n</p>", "created_at": "2020-10-27 01:31:58.131303", "updated_at":

from the United Kingdom, European Union or the European Economic Area, only required cookies, as described below, will be used on our Websites by default.</p>\n<p>WHAT ARE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</p>\n<p>\n<b>Cookies</b>.\nCookies are small data files placed on your computer or other internet-enabled devices that enable our features and functionality.\nThey allow us to record information when you visit or interact with our Websites.\nYou can find more information about cookies at <i>All About Cookies</i> www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Pixels</b>.\nPixels are small portions of code that we use as part of our Websites.\nWe use pixels to learn whether you have clicked on certain web content.\nThis helps us measure and improve our services and personalize your

how often you view certain content so that we can make our Website more efficient and easier to use.</p>\n<p>HOW DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</p>\n<p>We use cookies, web beacons, pixels, tags, scripts and other similar tracking technologies to make our Websites easier to use and to better tailor them to your interests and needs.\nWe use the information we obtain from cookies and other tracking technologies to carry out profiling activities in order to learn more about you and offer you tailored advertising based on your behavior on our Websites.\nSome technologies may also be placed by third party advertisers.\nWe also use these technologies to compile information that allows us to better understand our customers and visitors.</p>\n<p>WHAT KINDS OF COOKIES AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES DO WE USE?</p>\n<p>PERSISTENT AND SESSION COOKIES</p>\n<p>Cookies can remain on your device for different periods of time.\nWe use two types of cookies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Persistent cookies</b> are cookies that help us recognize you.\nThey are stored on your device in between browser sessions, allowing us to remember your preferences and actions across multiple sites and on multiple visits.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<b>Session cookies</b> expire at the end of your browser session, allowing us to link your actions during a particular browsing session.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>FIRST PARTY AND THIRD PARTY COOKIES</p>\n<p>There are two broad categories of cookies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cookies set directly by us, as a first party, to your device.</li>\n<li>Cookies set by third parties with our permission to your device.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We allow third parties to set cookies on our Websites.\nThird parties may use cookies, web beacons, pixels, tags, scripts and other similar tracking technologies to enable the third party\u2019s features or functionalities to be provided through the Website you are using.\nThe third party setting these cookies can recognize your device both when it visits our Website and when it visits certain other websites or services.\nFor example, our paid endorsers, or affiliates, may use third party cookies to identify you as a referral so they can be compensated if you sign up for services from us as a result of visiting one of our paid endorsers.\nIn the same way, third party vendors such as Google may use cookies or other device identifiers to provide you with targeted advertisements based on your past visits to our Website.</p>\n<p>CROSS-DEVICE TRACKING</p>\n<p>We perform cross-device tracking which allows us to provide you with relevant advertising on multiple devices.\nBy identifying browsing activity on your smartphones, tablets, desktop computers and other devices connected to the same IP address, or logged into the same account, we better understand the products and services that might be of interest to you.</p>\n<p>LOCAL STORAGE OBJECTS</p>\n<p>We also use Local Storage Objects, such as HTML5, to optimize screen presentation, video and other preference information.</p>\n<p>GOOGLE, ADOBE AND OTHER ANALYTICS</p>\n<p>We use Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics and other analytics as tools to help us understand how users engage with our Websites.\nLike many services, they use first party cookies to track user interactions with websites.\nIn our case, they are used to collect information about how users use our Websites.\nThis information is used to compile reports and to help us improve our Websites.\nThe reports disclose Website trends without identifying

Google\u2019s use of cookies across all websites you use, visit this Google page: https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated.\nTo provide you with more choice on how your data is collected by Google

DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</p>\n<p>We use the following types of cookies for the reasons described below.&nbsp.\nThese cookies may be set by us or a third party service provider to perform the functions described below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Required:</b> These cookies and tracking technologies are required to help our Websites work correctly or required to comply with the law (e.g., security requirements of data protection law).\nFor example, these cookies allow you to navigate our Websites and use essential features, including secure areas and shopping baskets.\nWe do not need to obtain your consent in order to use these cookies.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Analytics:</b> These cookies and tracking technologies help us understand how customers and visitors interact with our Websites.\nThey provide us with information about areas of our Websites visited, time spent on our Websites, transactions performed, and any error messages you receive.&nbsp.\nThese cookies allow us to improve the performance of our Websites.&nbsp.\nThey may collect your IP address but only for the purpose of identifying general locations of visitors and identifying fraudulent or spam traffic.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Advertising:</b> These cookies and tracking technologies allow us to deliver content, including advertisements, relevant to your specific interests.\nThis content may be delivered on our Websites or on third party websites or services.\nThey allow us to understand and improve the relevancy of our advertisements.\nThey may track personal information, including your IP address.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Functional:</b> These cookies and tracking technologies allow our Websites to remember choices you make to give you better functionality and a personalized experience.\nFor example, when you select a specific currency on one of our Websites, we will remember your currency selection when you return.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>HOW CAN I CONTROL COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</p>\n<p>If you visit our Websites from the United Kingdom, European Union or the European Economic Area, only required cookies, as described above, will be used on our Websites by default.\nWhen you visit our Websites from outside the United Kingdom and Europe, all cookies and similar tracking technologies described above will be used by default.\nIf you would prefer not to receive personalized ads based on your browser or device usage, you may generally express your opt-out preference to no longer receive tailored advertisements.&nbsp.\nPlease note that you will continue to see advertisements, but they will no longer be tailored to your interests.</p>\n<p>Cookies are managed on a brand-by-brand basis at the website level.\nThis means if you manage your cookie preferences for one Newfold brand, you will need to manage your preferences separately when you visit the Website of a different Newfold brand.</p>\n<p>If you opt out of receiving certain cookies from us, your web browser will be associated with a generic \u201copt-out\u201d cookie, which will prevent us from associating any non-personal information with your browser.\nSince this program is cookie-based, you may need to opt out again if you do any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delete your cookies</li>\n<li>Block cookies, including third party cookies</li>\n<li>Switch internet browsers</li>\n<li>Change computers</li>\n<li>Upgrade your web browser</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Internet browsers allow you to change your cookie settings via the \u201coptions\u201d or \u201cpreferences\u201d

Firefox</li>\n<li>Cookie settings in Chrome</li>\n<li>Cookie settings in Safari</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some internet browsers include the ability to transmit \u201cdo not track\u201d signals.\nBecause no industry standard has yet been developed with respect to \u201cdo not track,\u201d our Websites do not currently process or respond to such \u201cdo not track\u201d signals.</p>\n<p>Some internet browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 and other Local Storage Objects.</p>\n<p>CHANGES TO THIS COOKIES POLICY</p>\n<p>We will update this Cookie Notice to reflect changes in
