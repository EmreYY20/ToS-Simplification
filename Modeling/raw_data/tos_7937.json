Website(s).\nYouMail accounts are based on telephone numbers and must be created with your real identity and with a telephone number owned by you.\nYouMail reserves the right to change account information that may be considered misleading, false, or in conflict with data from industry standard telephone number and name databases from carriers and other standard sources.</p>\n<p>By registering for a YouMail account, you are providing your express consent to YouMail to receive informational messages and marketing messages solely related to your YouMail service until such time as you elect to opt out of receiving them and/or terminate your YouMail account.\nSuch informational or marketing messages may be delivered to your e-mail address, through push notifications in the YouMail apps and/or web site, through voicemail messages delivered straight to the YouMail service, and through SMS messages to the phone numbers you have provided.</p>\n<p>You may terminate your YouMail account and access to the Services by logging into the Website, clicking the link that says \"Close Your Account\", and following the instructions.</p>\n<p>You agree that YouMail may, without prior notice, immediately terminate, limit your access to, or suspend, your account and access to the Services.\nCause for such termination, limitation of access or suspension shall include, but not be limited to (a) breach or violation of the Terms or other incorporated agreements or guidelines, (b) a request by law enforcement or other government agency, (c) discontinuance or material modification to the Services (or any part thereof), (d) unexpected technical or security issues or problems, (e) extended periods of inactivity, (f) engagement by you in fraudulent or illegal activities, (g) nonpayment of any fees owed by you in connection with the Services, and/or (h) participation by you in any way in any legal action or claim against the Company.\nFurther, you agree that all terminations, limitations of access and suspensions for cause may be made in YouMail's sole discretion and that YouMail shall not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination, limitation, or suspension, of your account or access to the Services.</p>\n<p>Termination, limitation, or suspension, of your account may include, at YouMail's sole discretion, any or all of the following: (a) removal of access to all or part of the offerings within the Services, (b) deletion of your password and all related information, files and content associated with or inside your account (or any part thereof), (c) the playing of an \u201cout of service\u201d message to all parties who call your telephone number(s), and (d) the barring of any further use of all or part of the Services.</p>4.\nYOUMAIL'S VOICEMAIL SERVICE<p>One of the Services is the YouMail Voicemail Service.\nThis Service provides a number of \"automatic extensions\" to traditional voicemail services, and these extensions may have an impact on you or your callers with respect to privacy matters or telephone carrier service usage and related charges.\nYouMail generally makes these features \"opt-out\" and generally provides settings to customize their behavior and/or turn them off, though YouMail is not responsible to provide any ability for users to customize or limit any Service.</p>\n<p>These extensions include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Smart Greetings\", which allows customized greetings depending on who is calling you and automatically greets your callers with both your name and their name.\nSmart Greetings can be overridden by your selection of a greeting that you or someone else has recorded.</li>\n<li>\"Auto replies\", which under certain circumstances (a) provides callers a text message confirming to callers that they have left a voicemail message successfully, (b) may include a custom message, and (c) permits callers to see and modify the information shown with respect to their caller ID.\nYou can opt-out or customize aspects of who receives auto replies from you and under what conditions.</li>\n<li>\"Message sharing\", which allows you to share messages by providing a URL to that message, where the voicemail can easily be played by anyone with knowledge of that provided URL.\nThere is a YouMail privacy setting that can make your voicemails \"un-shareable\".</li>\n<li>\"Smart Blocking\", which automatically plays an \"out of service\" message to phone numbers that YouMail deems to be problematic or that are on a user-created and maintained block list, and which automatically places in a spam folder messages from phone numbers deemed by YouMail to be sometimes problematic.\nYou can use a YouMail setting to control this behavior, and you can allow list individual phone numbers to ensure that such numbers are never blocked or put into a spam folder when they call you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>YouMail's voicemail service is not static and continues to evolve over time, with new features and changes to how existing features behave.\nYouMail reserves the right at any time to modify, limit, suspend, or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part thereof) with or without notice.\nYou agree that YouMail shall not be liable to you or to any third-party for any modification, limitation, suspension or discontinuance of the Services (or any part thereof).</p>\n<p>YouMail will use reasonable efforts to notify you of certain changes that would likely materially affect you or your callers' experience with the Services.\nThese notifications, as well as service announcements and/or administrative messages will be sent to your email address provided to and kept on file with YouMail, and you agree that you will keep such email address accurate and up to date, and that any email notification sent to such address shall be deemed suitable notice of such changes.\nYou also agree that a similar voice-message notice from YouMail left for you in your voicemail inbox will also be deemed suitable notice of such changes.</p>5.\nYOUMAIL AS YOUR AGENT<p>You agree that YouMail is your \"agent\" for answering and responding to calls, and fully operates on your behalf, as if YouMail were your personal secretary.\nYouMail therefore relies on your continuing representation that you have obtained, and that YouMail, as your agent, holds at all times, all necessary permissions to (a) answer all incoming calls to telephone numbers you forward to, or obtain from, YouMail, (b) access any and all contact information you provide, (c) take messages, (d) deliver messages to the email address you provide, and (e) send text or email messages to you and to your callers in response to any call or voicemail.\nFurther, if you add additional phone numbers from YouMail, YouMail has permission to make outbound calls and send and receive text messages on your behalf.</p>\n<p>You also agree that YouMail is your \"agent\" for blocking and/or otherwise answering unwanted or illegal phone calls, and that YouMail may block a call by any means, including, but not limited to, by suppressing the ring and/or ring notices on your phone, by playing an \u201cout of service\u201d message, or by taking messages and routing them to a spam folder.\nFurther, you agree that (a) YouMail may decide as your agent which calls to block and how to block them while providing you mechanisms to customize YouMail's behavior, and (b) YouMail may analyze captured audio and/or messages and associated calling and called numbers and use these data to identify and block calls made to others, as well as to share these findings and your underlying data with telephone service providers, enforcement authorities, and others for the purpose of preventing and/or prosecuting illegal or unwanted calls being made to you, other YouMail users, or any other person or entity that might be the recipient of such calls.</p>6.\nSTANDARD AND PREMIUM SERVICES.\nABUSE OF THE SERVICES<p>YouMail provides a rich set of features and capabilities in its standard services.\nYouMail does not charge for the standard Services or to become a Registered User.</p>\n<p>YouMail also offers services and features that require explicit agreement to fees prior to the use of such service or feature (\"Premium Services\").\nExamples of Premium Services include certain greetings recorded by artists and/or professional voice talent (which may have an associated fee for usage), plans that provide access to YouMail's professional automated virtual assistant, plans that include voicemail transcription services, and other offerings that YouMail may make available as \"fee-based\" offerings.\nNo fee payable to YouMail will ever be charged to you unless you have taken specific action to order the Premium Service in question.</p>\n<p>The standard Services are solely for your personal, non-commercial use.\nUsers using any of the Services for commercial purposes are required to select and pay for one or more of the Premium Services.</p>\n<p>YouMail\u2019s Services are designed for use by a single user and may not be used for any purpose other than as expressly identified by YouMail.\nWithout limiting the foregoing, YouMail Services never include the right to scrape data from, or to reproduce, reconstruct or \u201creverse engineer\u201d, any portion of, YouMail\u2019s databases or derived data, or to test telephone numbers to learn if such telephone numbers are being blocked or identified as suspicious by YouMail.\nAny of the foregoing, and any use not expressly identified by YouMail in this Agreement or in a separate signed agreement with YouMail, is an \u201cAbuse of the Services\u201d.\nThe price and availability of Premium Services are subject to change without notice, and YouMail reserves the right to limit any product sold, or prohibit a sale altogether, at any time.\nYouMail also reserves the right to reject or cancel orders that use a coupon code obtained in violation of any coupon restriction.</p>\n<p>Subscriptions to any Premium Service are prepaid for the period selected (monthly, yearly, or otherwise).\nAll subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each subscription period, and once any discount code or special offer associated for that subscription expires, renew at the current in-store price for the subscribed service.</p>\n<p>Subscriptions to any Premium Service may be cancelled at any time, conveniently through the YouMail apps or through the YouMail website.\nAll cancellations and downgrades are processed automatically.</p>\n<p>All subscriptions are non-refundable, both for the initial purchase and subsequent monthly and annual renewals, except that if a specific plan offers a \u201crisk-free guarantee\u201d for a specific time period to the subscriber, YouMail will provide a refund upon the subscriber\u2019s request to YouMail for such a refund within the risk-free time period if (a) this is the first order of a given Premium Service by a given individual or entity, (b) no phone number associated with such plan has been ported into or out of YouMail, and (c) the order was not made via an in-app purchase mechanism billed through an iOS or Android app store.</p>\n<p>YouMail may, as part of various services and features, provide additional phone numbers to an individual user account, which include personalized access numbers and secondary phone numbers.\nThose phone numbers may be ported to an alternative carrier, however:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A phone number may only be ported from YouMail while there is an active, premium YouMail subscription that includes that phone number, and no numbers may be ported during any \"free trial\" or \"risk-free trial\" period.</li>\n<li>YouMail may charge a service fee for porting numbers from YouMail to an alternative carrier.\nIn these cases, such \"port-out\" fees must be paid prior to completing the porting of the number.</li>\n<li>In cases, where the phone number to be ported was obtained via YouMail, YouMail may charge you an additional fee for replacing the ported number with a substantially similar phone number.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Except as prohibited by law, we may assess late charges if you do not pay on time.\nYou must pay these late charges when we bill you for them.\nThe late charge will be calculated and applied each month at the lesser of one percent (1%) of the unpaid amount per month or the maximum rate permitted by law.\nWe may use a third-party to collect past-due amounts.\nYou must pay all costs we incur to collect any past-due amounts, including reasonable attorneys' fees and other legal fees and costs.\nWe may suspend or cancel your Services if you fail to pay all amounts owed to YouMail in full and on time.</p>7.\nLIMITATIONS ON USAGE<p>YouMail provides the Services on a limited basis that permits reasonable usage of the Services by you.</p>\n<p>YouMail may choose at any time to modify and/or enforce such limitations at its sole discretion.\nReasonable usage may be defined as the average reasonable customer usage levels of any Service or feature, the usage limits explicitly communicated at or after the time of purchase, or YouMail's own determined levels of usage.\nYouMail reserves the right to terminate any Service, change packaging and pricing, or otherwise take any action as necessary to prevent customer abuse and/or inappropriate or unauthorized use of Services, including without limitation Abuse of the Services.\nYou acknowledge that YouMail may establish general practices and limits concerning use of the Services, including, without limitation, the maximum number of days messages are retained, the maximum number of messages retained, the maximum number of calls made and/or answered and/or forwarded and/or texts sent or received, the maximum storage space allotted with respect to Services on your behalf, the maximum number of times (and the maximum duration for which) you may access YouMail, and the maximum number of minutes used by the Service on your behalf, including, but not limited to, to play greetings, record messages, make phone calls, and the like.\nYou agree that YouMail has no responsibility or liability for the deletion of, or failure to store, any messages and/or other communications.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge that YouMail has the right to delete accounts that are inactive for an extended period of time or that YouMail determines, in its sole discretion to be involved in an Abuse of the Services, as well as to remove all information associated with those accounts, such as but not limited to stored voicemails, call history, and settings.\nYouMail considers any account to be inactive if it does not have a record of at least one the following activities within a 90-day period: (a) a customer or application login and/or active session for that account, (b) a received voicemail or missed call, or (c) a payment to the account.</p>8.\nPOTENTIAL SERVICE-PROVIDER CHARGES.\nAVOIDANCE OF SUCH CHARGES<p>YouMail supports AT&amp;T, Verizon Wireless, Sprint and T-Mobile, as well as many other U.S.\ncarriers (the \"Cellular Providers\").\nStandard airtime, text and data charges of your cellular provider and the cellular providers of your callers may apply when interacting with the Services.\nIt is generally possible for you to minimize or eliminate charges from your cellular provider in connection with the Services, which may relate to three areas: telephone access number access, data connectivity, and text messages.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Access Numbers.</strong> YouMail's Voicemail Service provides you with a YouMail telephone access number to which your missed telephone calls are forwarded, as well as a YouMail telephone access number you can call to retrieve your messages (which number may be the same for any given user).\nWhen calls are forwarded to a YouMail telephone access number or you call to retrieve messages, normal toll and/or long distance and plan minute usage may apply.\nTo reduce the chance of unexpected charges, we strongly recommend you have a \"nationwide\" plan that includes sufficient minutes to account for any incremental forwarding or retrieval call minutes.\nWe also recommend retrieving messages online via YouMail\u2019s desktop or mobile website or through our mobile apps whenever it is convenient.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Data Connectivity.</strong> YouMail's mobile apps require a data connection to our servers to operate.\nWe recommend that you have a data plan that covers your data usage to avoid incremental charges for data use.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Text Messages.</strong> YouMail provides features that can result in text messages being sent to your phone, which may result in additional Cellular Provider charges.\nFor example, under certain circumstances, you can have YouMail send text messages to your phone when a new voicemail or missed call occurs (\"Text Alerts\").\nIf you use these features, we recommend that you have a text-messaging plan that includes enough text messages to avoid unexpected \"per text\" text-message charges from Text Alerts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyone may text \"STOP\" from any mobile phone to any phone number used by YouMail to send a text message and YouMail will not be able to send that phone any further text messages for any purpose, beyond a single confirmation text.\nAlternatively, you can control what text messages are sent from the \"Settings\" section of the Website.</p>\n<p>Based upon certain user-controlled settings, YouMail may generate text messages to your callers, such as replying to incoming calls with a text message to the caller, either individually or by using \"Auto Replies\".\nThis may result in Cellular Provider charges for both you and your callers.\nBy using these features, you are representing that we are acting as an intermediary on your behalf and at your request in sending these text messages, as part of our acting as your agent for answering and responding to calls.\nYouMail is not responsible for any third-party fees (including but not limited to airtime, text or data charges) incurred by you or your callers.</p>9.\nHELP AND SUPPORT<p>Users of YouMail's non-Premium Services have access to community-based support, along with \"answers to common questions\" through the \"Help\" link on the Website and mobile applications.\nYou may report bugs, problems or complaints to support@youmail.com.\nYouMail does not guarantee communications from non-Premium Service users will be responded to and/or acted upon.</p>\n<p>Users of YouMail's Premium Services have access to various additional levels of support, including live customer support that may be accessed via phone at 1-800-374-0013 or email at prosupport@youmail.com.\nCustomer support is staffed Monday through Friday from 9:00am to 5:00pm Pacific Time.</p>10.\nNO REUSE OR RESALE OF SERVICES<p>By registering and/or using the Services, you agree that you will not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell, make available for gain or exploit for any commercial purpose, any portion of the Services, use of the Services, or access to the Services, without an express and specific written commercial agreement with YouMail.\nWithout limiting the foregoing, as identified elsewhere in this Agreement, such are, and may be deemed to be by YouMail in its sole discretion, to be an Abuse of the Services.</p>11.\nPROPRIETARY RIGHTS.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.\nINFRINGEMENT<p>The Company owns and retains proprietary rights in the Services.\nThe Services contain and utilize copyrighted material, databases and derived data, trademarks, patented technology, and other proprietary information of the Company, its licensors and licensees, and are protected by intellectual property and other laws.\nThe Company's property includes all content included on its websites or in its mobile applications or accessed through phone calls, including all text, graphics, logos, button icons, images,

ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES.\nWITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THE COMPANY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>\n<p>THE COMPANY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT YOUR USE OF ANY OF THE SERVICES WILL BE SECURE, UNINTERRUPTED, AVAILABLE, OR ERROR-FREE, THAT THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT ANY DEFECTS IN THE SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED.\nTHE COMPANY DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR, AND NO WARRANTY IS MADE WITH RESPECT TO, THE CONNECTIVITY AND

referred to in the construction of, any provision of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>Words in the singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa.\nWhenever examples are used in this Agreement with the words \"including\", \"for example\", \"any\", \"e.g.\", \"such as\", \"etc.\" or any derivation thereof, such examples are intended to be illustrative and not in limitation thereof.\nAll references to the masculine, feminine or neuter genders shall mean and include all genders.</p>\n<p>In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement for any reason shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, any such provision(s) shall be severed, and such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement or any action in any other jurisdiction.\nMoreover, if one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be excessively broad or unreasonable as to the period, scope or geographical area so as to be unenforceable at law, such provision or provisions shall be modified or substituted by the appropriate judicial body so as to cover the maximum period, scope or geographical area permitted by applicable law.</p>\n<p>ASSIGNMENT.\nCHOICE OF LAW.\nVENUE.\nThe provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the successors and assigns of YouMail.\nThis Agreement is personal to you, and may not be assigned or transferred to any other person or party.\nThis Agreement is

opt-out pursuant to the procedure below, you agree that all disputes between you and YouMail (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with YouMail, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms and/or your use of any Service, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and YouMail hereby expressly waive trial by jury.\nAs an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local \"small claims\" court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules.\nYou may bring claims only on your own behalf.\nNeither you nor YouMail (with respect to you) will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims or events covered by this Agreement.\nYou also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another

unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the matter, then either YouMail or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services.\nJudgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction.\nAny provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms.</p>\n<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate.\nIf you do so,

preceding language in this arbitration section will be null and with respect to such matters.\nThis agreement to arbitrate will survive the termination of your relationship with YouMail indefinitely.</p>", "created_at": "2023-04-10 02:27:50.804195", "updated_at": "2023-04-10 02:28:15.068933"}, {"id": 15357, "name": "Privacy Policy", "url": "https://www.youmail.com/privacy", "xpath":

including personal information, from the following sources:</p>\n<p>\n<u>Information You Provide to Us Directly.</u> We collect information you explicitly provide to us.\nWhen you create a YouMail account, for example, we may collect personal information including your name, phone number(s), and email address.\nShould you upgrade to a premium offering, we collect information about the YouMail premium plan you purchase, and we may collect credit card or other payment information, as well as your address and zip code.\nWe may also collect information you provide when you take advantage of specific features, options, and settings, such as granting us permission to upload your address book or forwarding additional phone numbers to your account.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Data Collected Through Service Usage.</u> We collect information from your use of the Services.\nWe may collect information from and about the browser or device you are using, as well as information about your internet or other network activity.\nThis information may include your IP address, device type, browser and software characteristics (such as type and operating system), referral URLs, network state, device identifiers or other unique identifiers such as advertising identifiers (e.g., \u201cad-ID\u201d or \u201cIDFA\u201d) and identifiers associated with cookies, and carrier information.\nWe also collect information about your activity on the Services including information about the web pages and app screens you visit.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Data Collected Through Cookies and Similar Technologies.</u> Similarly to many online services, we use various technologies to collect usage data and store preferences.\nThese technologies include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<i>Cookies.</i> A cookie is a small data file created by our website and stored on your computer or phone.\nThe use of cookies is standard in the industry.\nWe use cookies for login verification, session management, load balancing, and personalization.\nWe never use cookies to retrieve information from your computer or phone that you had not already voluntarily provided to us, and we do not allow advertisers or other companies access to our cookies.\nYou can change your browser settings to disable cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie.\nHowever, disabling cookies or deleting information contained in cookies may interfere with the Services, including not being able to store your preferences or login information.</li>\n<li>\n<i>Pixels and Beacons.</i> In addition to cookies, we may use other technologies such as pixel tags or web beacons, which can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, to collect certain types of information from your browser or device, check whether, when, and from what IP, you have viewed a particular web page, email message, image, or ad.</li>\n<li>\n<i>Mobile SDKs.</i> We may also work with third parties including our business partners and service providers who use mobile Software Development Kits (\u201cSDKs\u201d) to collect information, such as advertising identifiers (e.g., \u201cad-ID\u201d or \u201cIDFA\u201d) and information related to how mobile devices interact with the Services, including which actions are taken in our mobile apps.\nThis information can be used, for example, to determine what web pages, apps, and services most effectively refer people to sign up for and/or download YouMail.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<u>Data Related To Phone Calls.</u> We collect information for the calls related to your use of the Services.\nFor example, we store data about every call that is visible to its mobile applications or that involves the YouMail telephony platform.\nThese data includes the metadata on the call, including the originating phone number and caller id, the originally called number (when available), the terminating phone number, and the contents and transcription of any audio associated with the call, such as a voicemail that is deposited by the caller.\nThis information is kept completely private, stored securely and available only to your account except in the specific cases described below where you explicitly share the data or give us access to it.</p>\n<p>\n<b>3.\nUse of Information We Collect</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>General Use.</u> We use the information we collect from or about you to help provide the YouMail Services.\nThis includes: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Operating the Services, including call blocking, voicemail replacement, auto attendant, virtual number provision and usage, reverse phone number look up, and other-related services.</li>\n<li>Customizing you and your callers\u2019 experience with using the Services.</li>\n<li>Evaluating and optimizing the features and performance of the Services.</li>\n<li>Communicating with you about the Services.</li>\n<li>Providing customer support for your use of the Services.</li>\n<li>Providing and evaluating the advertising you see through or related to the Services.</li>\n<li>Compiling aggregate data for business purposes.</li>\n<li>Enforcing our terms of service.</li>\n<li>Detecting and protecting against fraudulent, illegal or harmful activities.</li>\n<li>Complying with legal obligations.</li>\n<li>Any other purpose disclosed to you when we collect the information or that is related to a request made by you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<u>Use Of Call-Related Data</u>.\nWe may use data provided by you about individual calls and callers to better identify incoming phone numbers, support our robocall blocking efforts, and help others make or receive fewer unwanted calls.\nFor example, when you report a particular call as spam, you grant us permission to access the data for that call, including any audio provided in the call, and any associated commentary you provide, so that we can analyze it, publish it, and otherwise use those data to support robocall blocking efforts.\nSimilarly, when you provide names associated with phone numbers, we use those data to determine whether a caller is likely to be spam, as well as to validate or invalidate the caller IDs we or third parties are associating with particular phone numbers.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Use of Payment Information.</u> We use payment information, such as credit card numbers and billing ZIP code, and commercial information, such as the YouMail plan(s) you purchase, to help provide YouMail\u2019s premium services.\nFor example, we use payment information to process any payments you make, to retrieve your account information in the absence of online authentication, to determine whether a you are eligible for specific promotions, and to detect abuse of the Services.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Use of Aggregated Information.</u> In addition to the individual data use described in this Privacy Policy, we may aggregate information about you and other individuals together, while ensuring that the information does not directly or indirectly identify you.\nWe may use aggregated information for any legitimate business purpose, including for research and analysis, providing our Services, targeted advertising, and promotional purposes.\nFor example, we (or a third-party service provider working on our behalf) may collect and processes, non-personally identifiable, general information about demographics (age, gender, and interests) and usage of the Services.\nThis may include combining your actions on our website or apps with Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.\nThis category of information is general and cannot and is not used to identify specific users, telephone numbers, or email addresses.</p>\n<p>\n<b>4.\nSharing Information with Others</b>\n</p>\n<p>We may share information collected from or about you with others, including service providers, business partners, advertisers, and other companies that are not affiliated with YouMail, for the purposes described below.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Third-Party Service Providers.</u> We may share information collected from or about you with companies that provide specific services to us that enable providing, optimizing, evaluating, and improving our Services.\nThis includes telephony services providers (including SIP gateway, text message gateway, caller ID, and phone number providers), hosting providers, transcription providers, payment processing providers, and others.\nThe Company may provide specific information to these third parties, as may be necessary for them to provide specific services to the Company.\nFor example, to send you a text message, YouMail must provide your mobile number and the content of your message to a text message gateway service.\nSimilarly, to bill you for a premium service, we must provide information about you and your payment information to a third-party payment processer.</p>\n<p>This also includes sharing information with third-party service providers that support our goals to drive more engagement with our services, upsell our users to premium services, measure our service usage, and bring back former users.\nFor example, we share specific events with our service providers so we can determine what features are most important to our users and focus our efforts on improving them.\nAnother example is our adoption of the self-service advertising platform of DanAds International AB (\u201cDanAds\u201d).\nThe DanAds platform allows advertisers to buy ad space from us, carry out audience targeting, and obtain campaign performance results.\nDanAds\u2019 privacy policy is accessible at https://danads.com/privacy-policy/.\n</p>\n<p>YouMail enters into agreements with these third parties that contain applicable restrictions on use of and access to data covered by this Privacy Policy.\nYouMail cannot be responsible, however, for the actions of parties it does not own or control.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Third-Party Business Partners Engaged in Identifying and Blocking Robocallers.</u> We may share usage and call data with third parties, such as wireless carriers and the vendors they work with to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve the quality of their labeling and blocking services.\n</li>\n<li>Permit them to determine whether a call is likely from an unwanted robocaller.</li>\n<li>Help carriers, law enforcement, and others track down, disrupt, and/or prosecute robocallers and illegal actors, and </li>\n<li>Support other tasks that directly correspond to reducing the number of unwanted robocalls.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<u>Third-Parties Engaged in Advertising to Users and Potential Users.</u> We may share advertising IDs and other related information to third parties who provide advertising in our Services, so that they can provide more targeted advertising to our users.\nWe may also create custom audiences for third-party advertisers that support new user acquisition and remarketing efforts.\nHowever, when YouMail is provided by your existing carrier as a default voicemail, unless you separately agree via your carrier, there is no third-party advertising added by YouMail, there is no marketing to you based on your \u201cCPNI\u201d data, and no data on you or our communication-related activities is provided to these third-parties.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Third Parties When Required By Law or When Necessary to Protect Your or Our Rights.</u> We may disclose information from or about you in certain cases without providing you an opt-out mechanism.\nFor example, we may disclose your information to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Comply with the law or legal processes.</li>\n<li>Comply with requests for cooperation from a government entity.&nbsp.\n</li>\n<li>Protect our legal rights, or those of our affiliates or partners.</li>\n<li>Protect our users or related third parties.</li>\n<li>Protect against fraud.</li>\n<li>Enforce our Terms of Use.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<u>Third Parties in Connection with Certain Transactions.</u> If we sell all or part of our business, make a transfer of assets, or otherwise might be involved in a change of control transaction, or in the event of bankruptcy, we may transfer information from or about you to one or more third parties as part of the transaction, including the due diligence process.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Parties With Your Consent Or Explicit Sharing</u>.\nWe may also share information from or about you with any party when we have your consent or when you otherwise choose to share such information.\nFor example, the Services offer a set of features that permit you to share or publish voicemail and/or share or publish call data, including the following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You may forward a voicemail to another user, to an arbitrary email address, or to a phone number, either individually or by using a setting that does so automatically.\nIf you share a voicemail, you assume the responsibility of the distribution of such messages, and that personal information contained in and metadata related to such messages may be made public.</li>\n<li>You may report a given call as spam and provide commentary on given calls and callers.\nWhen you do so, your spam report includes all information about the call, including the caller, the audio associated with the caller, and any explicit comments you provide.\nThis information may be published on YouMail website, and this information may be made available to third-parties interested in blocking calls from such callers, such as carriers involved in the call and/or brands or companies mentioned in such calls.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>5.\nYour Controls and Choices, Including Opt-Out Options</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>Opt-Out from Marketing Communications.</u> When you sign up for YouMail, you agree to allow us to communicate with you through emails and/or
