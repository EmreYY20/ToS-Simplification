and economic surveys.\nThese collections are in addition to those outlined in the Bank's Data Privacy Policy.</p>\n<strong>Monitoring</strong>\n<p>The Bank monitors this website for unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, to defeat or circumvent security measures, or to use this site for anything other than its intended purposes.\nBy using this website, you consent to such monitoring and are advised that if our monitoring reveals possible evidence of criminal activity, the Bank may provide such evidence to appropriate law enforcement

more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.\nCookies may be used to store items such as identifiers and user preferences.</p>\n<p>This website makes limited and specific use of permanent cookies.\nFirst, we use cookies to track user traffic patterns on this website.\nThe cookie contains an alphanumeric string that identifies your computer as having visited frbatlanta.org.\nWhen you return to the website, we will know that you have visited before and that will give us information about what you found valuable on our site.</p>\n<p>In addition, we may make occasional use of the same kind of cookie for user research, such as to administer user surveys, so that you will be invited to participate in a survey only once.\nIn this example, the cookie's presence on your computer will indicate to the website that you are a returning user and have already responded to the invitation.</p>\n<p>Finally, we may make use of permanent cookies to enable users to customize the appearance or content of this website.\nThis cookie does not record any information about you or your computer other than what is described above, nor can we use it to gather or correlate information about your activities elsewhere on the internet.</p>\n<p>Your participation will help us meet our goal of providing you with an easy-to-use website and high-quality content.\nYou can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, allowing you to decide whether to accept it or not.\nYou can also set your browser to not accept cookies at all.\nHowever, if you do so, some areas of some sites (including frbatlanta.org) may not operate properly.</p>\n<p>Transient memory-resident cookies or temporary session cookies are used to maintain a user's state of navigation during a browser session and expire from memory once the session is ended.\nThis website may from time to time use transient memory-resident cookies for on-line surveys, for example.\nIn addition, sometimes a third-party vendor will use cookies on one of the sites it operates, hosts, or manages for us\u2014for example, for online registration of certain conferences and workshops.\nSince the

conducts several economic surveys, such as the Survey of Business Uncertainty, the Business Inflation Expectations Survey, and the Consumer Payments Study.\nMost surveys collect information from businesses rather than individuals, but survey responses may include some personally identifiable information.\n</p>\n<strong>Survey of Business Uncertainty</strong>\n<p>The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (\"the Bank\")/Chicago Booth/Stanford Survey of Business Uncertainty is a panel survey that measures the one-year-ahead expectations and uncertainties that business firms across the United States have about their own employment, capital investment, and sales.\nA firm's participation in this survey is voluntary, and the Bank's use of personal data is carried out with the participant's consent.</p>\n<p>The survey collects information at an enterprise level, but includes some individual business contact information such as names and email addresses.\nFrom time to time, we will share business contact information with our survey partners at Chicago Booth or Stanford to facilitate information collection and interviews.\nNo other information is shared without first being de-identified.</p>\n<p>The safeguarding of this information is important to the Bank.\nWe take precautions to secure survey information provided to us and to work only with partners who take similar precautions to safeguard this data.\n</p>\n<strong>Business Inflation Expectations Survey</strong>\n<p>The Business Inflation Expectations Survey measures the year-ahead inflationary sentiments of businesses located in the Sixth District of the Federal Reserve System.\nThis is an online survey of approximately 300 panelists representing businesses of various sizes within the Sixth District.\nThe survey collects information at an enterprise level, but includes some individual business contact information such as contact names and email addresses.\nA firm's participation in this survey is voluntary, and the Bank's use of personal data is carried out with the participant's consent.\nInformation collected for this survey is not shared with third parties unless it has been de-identified.</p>\n<p>The safeguarding of this information is important to the Bank.\nWe take precautions to secure survey information provided to us and to work only with partners who take similar

with partners who take similar precautions to safeguard this data.</p>\n<strong>Federal Reserve Payments Survey</strong>\n<p>The Federal Reserve Payments Study is an ongoing effort to quantify aggregate payment volumes, payments fraud, and related information in the United States to offer a periodic benchmark of developments in the U.S.\npayments system to policymakers, the industry, and the public.</p>\n<p>The information collected for this study includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aggregated, de-identified information relating to noncash payments, cash withdrawals and deposits, third-party payments fraud, and related information provided by a nationally representative sample of commercial banks, savings institutions, and credit unions</li>\n<li>Aggregated, de-identified information relating to the number and value of electronic payments, payments fraud, and related information provided by a census of major card networks, payment processors, and card issuers</li>\n<li>Information relating to check payments including distribution and purpose of payments from a random sample of checks processed by the Federal Reserve Financial Services pursuant to Federal Reserve Banks Operating Circular 1, Section 7.3</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We get assistance from the GCI Analytics office of McKinsey &amp.\nCompany and Blueflame Consulting and Research LLC for survey administration as well as data collection and analysis for the study.\nIn working with our partners, we may have to share some firm-level and personally identifiable information.\nThe safeguarding of this information is important to the Bank.\nWe take precautions to secure survey information, both in transit and at rest, and to work only with partners who take similar precautions to safeguard this data.\nAny personally identifiable information collected for this study is de-identified as soon as possible after collection, and no personally identifiable information is retained longer than necessary.</p>\n<strong>Small Business Credit Survey</strong>\n<p>The Small Business Credit Survey is a national survey that provides insight into the financing needs and experiences of businesses with fewer than 500 employees.\nAlthough the survey primarily collects business-level data, some personal information may be collected when relevant to the purpose of the study, such as personal financial information for business owners who rely on personal credit.\nA firm's participation in this survey is voluntary, and the Bank's use of personal data is carried out with the participant's consent.</p>\n<p>From time to time, we share data with other Federal Reserve Banks subject to confidentiality requirements.\nSurvey information will not be shared outside of the Federal Reserve System without first being de-identified.</p>\n<p>The safeguarding of this information is important to the Bank.\nWe take precautions to secure survey information provided to us and to work only with partners who take similar precautions to safeguard this data.</p>\n<strong>Collection of information for job applicants</strong>\n<p>We collect information from you in connection with processing your

"/html/body/div[1]/div/div[2]/div/div[2]/div/div/div", "text": " <p>\n<strong>Introduction and Scope</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This data privacy notice provides a high-level overview of Federal Reserve Bank (Reserve Bank) activities that rely, or partially rely on collection and use of personal information.\nWe seek to provide transparency into relevant Reserve Bank functions, the personal information involved, and general uses of such information.</p>\n<p>While this notice covers general categories of activities and functions conducted across and within multiple Reserve Banks, each Reserve Bank is a separate legal entity responsible for its own privacy practices.\nAs some of the functions that the Reserve Banks perform have been operationally consolidated into one or more Reserve Banks, each Reserve Bank is publishing a similar version of this notice regardless of whether a function is primarily performed at a particular Reserve Bank.\nReserve Banks may also publish a separate privacy notice providing more specific information about that Reserve Bank's data privacy practices.\n<s>\n</s>\n</p>\n<p>When we use the term <em>personal information </em>in this notice, we mean personal information handled or retained by a Reserve Bank that is linked or linkable to an individual.\nThis notice covers instances where personal information is received from sources other than the individuals to which the personal information relates.\nIt also covers situations where individuals provide personal information for Reserve Bank security or law enforcement purposes.</p>\n<p>This notice is <strong>not</strong> intended to cover situations</p>\n<ul>\n<li>that are generally covered by more specific notices posted at the point of collection, such as collecting personal information directly from members of the public on the web (e.g., signing up for newsletters);</li>\n<li>where the Reserve Banks collect or use personal information for routine internal functions, such as managing employees, administering benefit plans, and performing audits and accounting.\nor</li>\n<li>that involve operation of Reserve Bank websites (e.g., cookie policies).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Reserve Bank Functions That Use Personal Information</strong>\n<br>\nThis notice describes the six core functions that the Reserve Banks perform involving personal information that are within the scope explained above.\nRegardless of functional area, the Reserve Banks DO NOT sell personal information.\nThe Reserve Banks DO share personal information if required by law, or if such sharing is necessary to accomplish the listed functions and activities.\nThis includes sharing between the Reserve Banks and with Reserve Bank vendors if such vendor requires the information to provide services to the Reserve Bank(s).</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Supervision &amp.\nRegulation</strong>\n</em>\n<br>\nThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) is a federal agency that is responsible for the supervision and regulation of certain types of financial institutions (defined in section 3 below) including bank holding companies, state-chartered banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System, savings and loan holding companies, foreign banks operating in the United States, and other entities.\nThe Board has delegated certain supervision and regulation functions, including the examination of supervised entities and the processing of certain banking applications and notices, to Reserve Banks as agents of the Board.</p>\n<p>In performing these delegated functions, the Reserve Banks receive personal information from financial institutions.\nFor example, Reserve Banks review consumer loan data as part of an examination of a bank.\nReserve Banks may also receive personal information from supervised institutions about their shareholders, directors, and executive officers in connection with applications submitted by institutions for approval.\nThe Reserve Banks protect this personal information in accordance with the Board's data privacy policies.\nFor more information about what personal information may be involved in supervisory activities, please see the Federal Reserve Board Privacy Program site.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Fiscal Agent Services to the United States Department of the Treasury (Treasury)</strong>\n</em>\n<br>\nThe Reserve Banks act as fiscal agents to the U.S.\nTreasury to support its goals related to collecting, disbursing, borrowing, investing, and accounting for government funds.</p>\n<p>In this capacity, the Reserve Banks collect, use, and share personal information for the exclusive purpose of providing such fiscal services.\nIn carrying out these functions, the Reserve Banks follow the Treasury's Data Privacy Policy and other requirements.\nSee the U.S.\nTreasury Privacy Policy and the list of privacy impact assessments published by the Treasury: https:/fiscal.treasury.gov/pia.html</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Financial Services</strong>\n</em>\n<br>\nThe Reserve Banks provide financial services to depository institutions such as banks, credit unions, and savings and loans associations (together, \"financial institutions.)\" These services include acting as an intermediary between financial institutions for clearing checks, as well as settling Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments and electronically transferring funds.</p>\n<p>The receipt and sharing of personal information are necessary aspects of the Reserve Banks' provision of financial services.\nAs financial intermediaries, Reserve Banks come into possession of personal information such as names, addresses, and account numbers when they process payment transactions submitted by financial institutions.\nIn some instances, a check or payment instruction might also include a social security number or other, more sensitive personal information.\nAs financial intermediaries, the Reserve Banks receive such personal information from financial institutions and do not collect it directly from individuals.\nThe Reserve Banks do not control the type or accuracy of personal information submitted by financial institutions.\nThe Reserve Banks pass payment transaction information to the next financial institution in the payment chain either directly or through that financial institution's designated agent/vendor.\nSuch information may also be used in connection with compliance activities, economic research, and for other operational purposes related to payments processing.\nFor more information about these financial services, see Federal Reserve Bank Financial Services.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Lending</strong>\n</em>\n<br>\nThe Reserve Banks extend certain types of credit to financial institutions.\nThis includes allowing short-term overdrafts on accounts (called daylight overdrafts) as well as other lending programs (called Discount Window advances).</p>\n<p>Discount Window advances must be secured by collateral.\nThe collateral pledged to a Reserve Bank may include consumer loans (e.g., mortgage loans or auto loans).\nWhile the loans generally remain in the custody of the financial institution borrowing from the Reserve Bank, the Reserve Banks require information about each of the loans pledged as collateral.\nThe consumer-loan-level information obtained for collateral purposes include name, loan number, loan amount, and balance.\nIf actual loan documentation is obtained for sampling or safekeeping purposes, it will include all the information contained therein, which may also include social security numbers, dates of birth, and account numbers.\nPersonal information obtained for the lending functions is used only to support and facilitate these lending activities, and is shared only to the extent necessary to support these activities.\nLoan information may also be shared with other financial institutions, such as corporate credit unions and home loan banks, that similarly provide liquidity to depository institutions, to prevent double-pledging collateral.\nPlease see www.frbdiscountwindow.org for more information about these activities.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Research &amp.\nMonetary Policy</strong>\n</em>\n<br>\nThe Research and Monetary Policy functions conduct independent economic research for publication in leading academic journals and provide policy analysis in support of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy mission and general responsibility to promote the effective operation of the U.S.\neconomy and, more generally, the public interest.\nOther departments in the Reserve Bank, such as Supervision and Regulation and Community Development, may conduct research in fulfilling their responsibilities and may collaborate with the Research and Monetary Policy functions.\nOverall, Federal Reserve research covers a wide range of topics to produce various forms of output available to the general public and other stakeholders.</p>\n<p>Research and policy analysis can be data-intensive activities that involve analyzing detailed information.\nWhile some of this data include personal information, it is typically anonymized, or de-identified with strict prohibitions against re-identification.\nSome of this information is acquired from third-party data providers.\nThe Reserve Banks may also acquire information using surveys they design alone or in partnership with other organizations.\nThe safeguarding and responsible use of information for research is of the utmost importance to the Reserve Banks.\nPersonally identifiable information collected or acquired by the Reserve Banks is subject to strict information security controls (based on the NIST framework) and other controls including restrictions on access, use, sharing, storage, and disposal of the information.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Law Enforcement</strong>\n</em>\n<br>\nEach Reserve Bank has its own Federal Reserve law enforcement unit responsible for protecting its operations, facilities, and physical assets.</p>\n<p>In order to protect the people and assets of the Reserve Banks, Law Enforcement collects some personal information from people who visit the Reserve Banks.\nSuch visitors may be required to provide identifying information before being allowed access to Reserve Bank facilities.\nThis information may include name and information on a government-issued ID.\nSome Reserve Banks also collect personal information to conduct background checks of vendors, contractors, and employees for the purpose of verifying identity and managing risk.\nBackground checks, public records searches, and other information gathering may also be conducted for the purpose of assessing potential threats to the Federal Reserve System.\nThese processes are conducted in accordance with applicable law, and could involve the sharing of personal information with vendors engaged to perform screening and/or with governmental agencies that conduct aspects of the screening.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Questions or Comments</strong>\n<br>\nIf you have any questions, comments, or concerns about this notice or the Reserve Banks' general privacy practices, please use this form to submit them.\nWe only use the personal information you provide to respond to your question, comment, or concern.\nFor more inquiries concerning the privacy practices specific to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta please see the online privacy policy.</p>\n<p>Questions or comments relating to Board-delegated and fiscal agent functions should be directed to the Board of Governors and the U.S.\nTreasury, respectively.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Changes to this Privacy Notice</strong>\n<br>\nThe

time.</p>\n<p> Questions or comments relating to Board-delegated and fiscal agent functions should be directed to the Board of Governors and the U.S.\nTreasury,
