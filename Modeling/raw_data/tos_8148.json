inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.\nDO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY

us.\nFor instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g.\nphone or email) that you have previously provided to us.\nWe may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.\nTo the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification.\nIf, however, we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes.\nWe will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<u>Other privacy rights</u>\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you may object to the processing of your personal data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you may request

the CCPA.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you may request to opt-out from future selling of your personal information to third parties.\nUpon receiving a request to opt-out, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than 15 days from the date of the request submission.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To exercise these rights, you can contact us&nbsp;by email
