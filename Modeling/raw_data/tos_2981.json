Integritet AB (556999-4469).\nOVPN Integritet AB is registered in Sweden and will henceforth be referred to as \"We\", \"Us\", \"Our\" and \"OVPN\".</p>\n<p> OVPN is the privacy friendly VPN provider.\nAs such, our entire infrastructure is built with privacy &amp.\nsecurity as the core principles.\nOVPN does not log any activity when connected to our VPN service.\nTherefore, we do not know who is connected to our service, what they are doing or when they are doing it.\nNothing can be connected to an account: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>no logging of traffic</li>\n<li>no logging of timestamps</li>\n<li>no logging of DNS requests</li>\n<li>no logging of IP addresses</li>\n<li>no logging of MAC addresses</li>\n<li>no logging of individual user bandwidth volumes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We own every single server used to run our service.\nAll VPN servers run without any hard drives - instead we use tmpfs storage in RAM.\nWriting permissions for the OpenVPN processes have been removed, as well as syslogs.\nOur VPN servers do not support physical console access, keyboard access nor usb access.</p> Court orders <p>OVPN can not provide any activity information or logs about users if a

verify if that person has a user account with us.\nWe have not provided any information about our users to any government entities.</p> Website <p>Our website runs on a physical machine that we own
