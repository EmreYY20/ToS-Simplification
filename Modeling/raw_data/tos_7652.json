or exchange value, and will not be transferable or refundable.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.5\tWhat Happens To Your Workspace.\n</strong>Upon termination of this Agreement (or, if applicable, the

Mural.\n</strong>Mural will defend Customer against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought against Customer by a third party alleging that any Services infringe or misappropriate such third party\u2019s intellectual property rights (a \u201c<strong>Claim Against Customer</strong>\u201d), and will indemnify Customer from any damages, attorney fees and costs finally awarded against Customer as a result of, or for amounts paid by Customer under a settlement approved by Mural in writing of, a Claim Against Customer.\nIn the event that our right to provide the Services is threatened or enjoined, we may in our sole discretion either obtain the right to continue providing the Services, or replace or modify the Services so that they become non-infringing, or, if such remedies are not reasonably available, terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice without liability to you and refund any prepaid fees covering our Services on a pro-rata basis following the effective date of such termination.\nThe above defense and indemnification obligations will not apply if the Claim Against Customer arises from: (i) the use or combination of the Services or any part thereof with any software, hardware, data, or processes not provided by Mural, and the Services or use thereof would not infringe without such combination.\nor (ii) Customer Content, a Third Party Service, or Customer\u2019s material breach of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.2\tIndemnification by Customer.</strong> Customer will defend Mural and its Affiliates against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought against Mural by a third party: (a) alleging that the combination of a Third Party Service or configuration provided by Customer and used with the Services infringes or misappropriates such third party\u2019s intellectual property rights.\nor (b) arising from (i) Customer\u2019s use of the Services or Content in an unlawful manner or in violation of our Terms of Service, (ii) any Content or Customer\u2019s use of Content with the Services, or (iii) a Third Party Service provided by Customer.\n((a)-(b) each a \u201c<strong>Claim Against Mural</strong>\u201d).\nand will indemnify Mural from any damages, attorney fees and costs finally awarded against Mural as a result of, or for any amounts paid by Mural under a settlement approved by Customer in writing of, a Claim Against Mural.\nThe above defense and indemnification obligations will not apply if the Claim Against Mural arises from Mural\u2019s material breach of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.3\tIndemnification Procedures.\n</strong>Each party\u2019s respective defense and indemnification obligations are contingent upon: (1) the indemnified party providing the defending party with prompt written notice of an eligible claim (no more than thirty (30) days after receipt of notice of the claim), as well as reasonable cooperation, assistance and information in the defense and settlement of any claim.\nand (2) the defending party having sole authority to defend or settle such claim (provided that the defending party will not enter into a settlement that is not confidential, requires an admission of fault, or imposes non-monetary relief without the indemnified party\u2019s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld).\nThe indemnified party will have the right to participate in the defense with counsel of its own choosing at its own expense, provided that such representation does not interfere with the defending party\u2019s right to control the defense.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.4\tExclusive Remedy.\n</strong>This Section 16 states the indemnifying party\u2019s sole liability to, and the indemnified party\u2019s exclusive remedy against, the other party for any third party claim described in this section notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>17.\nLIMITATIONS OF

for granting those rights, and a mutually acceptable written addendum to this Agreement must be executed specifically granting those rights.\nMural may make available certain deployments of the Services that are expressly designated for use by government customers at their option, and such deployments will be subject to a Plan Supplement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>20.\nEXPORT

regulations.\nBy accessing and using the Services, you represent, warrant, and covenant that you and your Authorized Users: (a) are not in a Restricted Jurisdiction.\n(b) are not listed on any

terminate Customer\u2019s rights to use the Services if it does not receive the corresponding payment from Reseller.\nIf Customer is entitled to a refund under this Agreement, Mural will refund any applicable fees to Reseller and Reseller will be solely responsible for refunding the appropriate amounts to Customer, unless otherwise specified.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>21.2\tRelationship with Mural.\n</strong>This Agreement is directly between Mural and Customer and governs all use of the Services by Customer.\nResellers are not authorized to modify this Agreement or make any promises or

between Customer and Reseller and is not responsible for the Reseller\u2019s acts, omissions, products or services.\nThe amount paid or payable by the Reseller to Mural for Customer\u2019s use of the Services under this Agreement will be deemed the amount paid or payable by Customer to Mural under this Agreement for purposes of Section 17 (Limitations of Liability).</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>22.\nMISCELLANEOUS<p>\n<strong>22.1\tUpdates to our Terms of Service.\n</strong>Our business, technology and Services evolve over time, and global laws and regulations
