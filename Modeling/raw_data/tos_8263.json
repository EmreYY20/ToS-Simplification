Privacy Policy Privacy Policy <br>\n<br>\nfor Kings Road Merch GmbH\nwww.kingsroadmerch.eu &amp.\neu.kingsroadmerch.com\n<br>\n<br>\nA.\nGeneral provisions regarding the processing of data on our website\n<br>\n<br>1.\nSubject of this Privacy Policy We, Kings Road Merch GmbH, are pleased about your interest in our websites www.kingsroadmerch.eu &amp.\neu.kingsroadmerch.com and in our offerings on our websites.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe protection of your personal data is important and a priority for us.\nTherefore, we aim to provide you with detailed information below about what data is collected when you visit our websites or use our services there and how we process and use this data from there on.\nWe also inform you here about which technical and organisational security measures we have taken in this regard.\nPersonal data (e.g.\nname, postal address, email address or telephone number of a data subject) is always processed in accordance with applicable data protection legislation.\nWith this Privacy Policy, we aim to inform you about the nature, volume and purpose of the personal data that we collect, use and process, and if you are affected by data processing, to inform you about your rights.\nAlthough we as the data controller have implemented numerous technical and organisational security measures for the processing of personal data, the transfer of data over the internet can be fundamentally insecure, meaning that it is impossible to guarantee absolute security.\nWe ask that you take this into account when using our web-based service.\n<br>\n<br>\n2.\nDefinition of terminology This Privacy Policy uses terminology specified by the legislative in the General Data Protection Regulation (also referred to from this point as the GDPR).\nThe GDPR can be accessed at the following link:\nhttp://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=EN The purpose of our Privacy Policy is to inform you in easy-to-understand language about how your personal data is processed on our website.\n<br>\n<br>\n3.\nName and postal address of the data controller responsible for processing \"Controller\" as defined by data protection legislation:\nKings Road Merch GmbH<br>\nUntere Brinkstrasse 66<br>\n44141 Dortmund - Germany\n<br>\nTel.\n+49 (0)231-496694-0\n<br>\nEmail:

Policy in relation to specific processing of personal data, data that we have stored will be erased as soon as it is no longer required for its intended purpose and as long as there are no retention obligations preventing its erasure.\nIf the data of data subjects (the persons to whom the data relates) is not erased because it is required for other, legally permissible purposes, its processing will be restricted, which means that the data will be locked down and not processed for any other purposes.\nFor instance, this might apply to the data of data subjects that must be retained due to commercial law or tax law requirements.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe law requires data to be retained for six years under Section 257, Paragraph 1 of the German Commercial Code (accounting ledgers, inventories, opening balance sheets, end-of-year financial statements, business correspondence, accounting documents, etc.) or for ten years under Section 147, Paragraph 1 of the German Fiscal Code (ledgers, records, management reports, accounting documents, business correspondence, etc.)\n<br>\n<br>\n6.\nRights of data subjects\n<br>\n<br>\n6.1.\nRight to confirmation\n<br>\n<br>\nAny data subject is entitled to request confirmation from the data controller responsible for processing about whether personal data pertaining to them is being processed.\nIf a data subject wishes to make use of this right to confirmation, they can contact us or another employee for this purpose at any time.\n<br>\n<br>\n6.2.\nRight to information\n<br>\n<br>\nAny data subject whose personal data is being processed is entitled to receive information at any time about what personal data is stored about them and to receive a copy of this information.\nThe data subject is also entitled to receive the following information:\n<br>\n<br>\n- the purposes of processing\n<br>\n<br>\n- the categories of personal data being processed\n<br>\n<br>\n- the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data is or will be disclosed, especially where recipients are located in Third Countries (non-EEA countries) or are international organisations\n<br>\n<br>\n- where possible, the planned duration of storage of the personal data.\nif this is not possible, the criteria that define how long this data is stored for\n<br>\n<br>\n- the existence of a right to have their personal data corrected or erased, to have processing restricted by the data controller, and to object to this processing\n<br>\n<br>\n- the existence of a right of complaint to a supervisory authority\n<br>\n<br>\n- where personal data is not collected from the data subject: all available information about the origin of the data\n<br>\n<br>\n- the existence of automated decision-making processes, including profiling under Article 22, Paragraphs 1 &amp.\n4 of the GDPR and - at least in these cases - relevant information about the applied logic as well as the scope and intended effects of such processing for the data subject\n<br>\n<br>\nThe data subject is also entitled to information about whether personal data is being transmitted to a Third Country or an international organisation.\nIf this is the case, the data subject is also entitled to receive information about suitable guarantees related to this transmission.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf a data subject wishes to make use of this right to information, they can contact us for this purpose at any time.\n<br>\n<br>\n6.3\tRight to correction\n<br>\n<br>\nAny data subject affected by the processing of personal data is entitled to demand the immediate correction of any incorrect personal data pertaining to them.\nThe data subject is also entitled to demand that incomplete personal data be completed in line with the purpose of the processing by submitting an additional declaration.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf a data subject wishes to make use of this right to correction, they can contact us for this purpose at any time.\n<br>\n<br>\n6.4\tRight to erasure <br>\n<br>\nAny data subject affected by the processing of personal data is entitled to demand that the data controller have their personal data erased immediately, as long as one of the following cases applies and as long as processing is not required:\n<br>\n<br>\n- The personal data has been collected for purposes or has been processed in other ways that are no longer required.\n<br>\n<br>\n- The data subject has withdrawn their consent that enabled processing under Article 6, Paragraph 1, Letter a of the GDPR or Article 9, Paragraph 2, Letter a of the GDPR, and there is no other legal basis for processing.\n<br>\n<br>\n- The data subject has lodged their objection to processing in accordance with Article 21, Paragraph 1 of the GDPR, and there are no overriding legitimate reasons for processing.\n<br>\n<br>\n- The personal data is being processed unlawfully.\n<br>\n<br>\n- The erasure of the personal data is required for compliance with a legal obligation under the law of the European Union or the member states to which the data controller is subject.\n<br>\n<br>\n- The personal data has been collected in connection with information society services in accordance with Article 8, Paragraph 1 of the GDPR.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf one of the aforementioned cases applies and a data subject wishes to have personal data stored by Kings Road Merch GmbH erased, they can contact us for this purpose at any time.\nWe will then have the requested erasure performed immediately.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf the personal data has been made public by Kings Road Merch GmbH and if our company in its capacity as the data controller is required to erase the personal data in accordance with Article 17, Paragraph 1 of the GDPR, we will take measures that are reasonable in consideration of available technology and implementation costs, including of a technical nature, to ensure that other data controllers that have processed the published personal data are notified that the data subject has demanded of these other data controllers the erasure of all links to this personal data or has demanded copies or duplicates of this personal data, unless processing is required.\nWe will have the necessary action taken on a case-by-case basis.\n<br>\n<br>\n6.5\tRight to restrict processing\n<br>\n<br>\nAny data subject affected by the processing of personal data is entitled to demand that the data controller restrict processing if one of the following requirements is met:\n<br>\n<br>\n- The correctness of the personal data is disputed by the data subject for a period of time in which the data controller can review the correctness of the personal data.\n<br>\n<br>\n- The data is being processed unlawfully, the data subject rejects erasure of their personal data and instead demands restriction of the use of their personal data.\n<br>\n<br>\n- The data controller no longer requires the personal data for the processing purposes, but the data subject requires it in order to establish, exercise or defend against legal claims.\n<br>\n<br>\n- The data subject has lodged an objection against processing in accordance with Article 21, Paragraph 1 of the GDPR and it is not yet certain whether the legitimate interests of the data controller outweigh those of the data subject.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf one of the aforementioned cases applies and a data subject wishes to have the use of their personal data stored by Kings Road Merch GmbH restricted, they can contact us for this purpose at any time.\nWe will have the necessary measures taken to have processing restricted.\n<br>\n<br>\n6.6\tRight to data portability\n<br>\n<br>\nAny data subject affected by the processing of personal data is entitled to receive a copy of their personal data as provided by the data subject to a data controller in a structured, standardised and machine-readable format.\nThe data subject is also entitled to have this data transmitted to another data controller without obstruction by the data controller to whom the personal data was provided, as long as the processing is performed on the basis of consent provided in accordance with Article 6, Paragraph 1, Letter a of the GDPR or Article 9, Paragraph 2, Letter a of the GDPR or on the basis of a contract in accordance with Article 6, Paragraph 1, Letter b of the GDPR, such processing is performed with the aid of automated procedures, and where this process is not required for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.\n<br>\n<br>\nWhen exercising their right to data portability, the data subject is also entitled under Article 20, Paragraph 1 of the GDPR to have the personal data transmitted directly by one data controller to another data controller insofar as this is technically feasible and does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other persons.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe data subject may contact us at any time to make use of their right to data portability.\n<br>\n<br>\n6.7\tRight to object\n<br>\n<br>\nAny data subject affected by the processing of personal data is entitled to lodge an objection against the processing of their personal data on the basis of Article 6, Paragraph 1, Letters e or f of the GDPR at any time, on grounds relating to their particular circumstances.\nThis also applies to profiling procedures based on these provisions.\n<br>\n<br>\nWhere such an objection is lodged, Kings Merch GmbH will cease to process the personal data, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\n<br>\n<br>\nWhere Kings Road Merch GmbH processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data subject has the right to object to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing at any time, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.\nWhere the data subject objects to processing for direct marketing purposes, the personal data will no longer be processed for such purposes.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe data subject is also entitled to object to the processing of their personal data for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89, Paragraph 1 of the GDPR on grounds relating to their particular circumstances unless this processing is required for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe data subject may contact us directly to make use of their right to object.\nThe data subject is also entitled to use automated methods governed by technical specifications to exercise their right to object in connection with the use of information society services, regardless of Directive 2002/58/EC.\n<br>\n<br>\n6.8\tAutomated individual decision-making, including profiling\n<br>\n<br>\nAny data subject affected by the processing of personal data is granted the right by the European Union legislative to be not subject to decision-making processes that are exclusively based on automated processing - including profiling where relevant - insofar as such processes may result in legal effects for them or may significantly adversely affect them in a similar fashion, unless such decisions <br>\n<br>\n- are necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between the data subject and the data controller or <br>\n<br>\n- are authorised by European Union or member state law to which the controller is subject, where these laws include suitable measures to safeguard the rights, freedoms and legitimate interests of the data subject or <br>\n<br>\n- are taken with the express consent of the data subject.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf the decision <br>\n<br>\n- is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between the data subject and the data controller or\n<br>\n<br>\n- is taken with the express consent of the data subject, Kings Road Merch GmbH will take suitable measures to safeguard the rights, freedoms and legitimate interests of the data subject, which include at the very least the right to invoke human intervention on the behalf of the data controller, to represent their own point of view, and to contest the decision.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf the data subject wishes to make use of their rights relating to automated decision-making processes, they can contact us to do so at any time.\n<br>\n<br>\n6.9\tRight to withdraw consent under data protection law\n<br>\n<br>\nAny data subject affected by the processing of personal data is entitled to withdraw consent for the processing of their personal data at any time.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf the data subject wishes to make use of their right to withdraw consent, they can contact us to do so at any time.\n<br>\n<br>\nAny data subject can contact us directly at any time with any questions and concerns that they may have on data protection and privacy.\n<br>\n<br>\n6.10\tRight to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority\n<br>\n<br>\nAny data subject affected by the processing of personal data is entitled to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority through us about how their personal data is processed.\n<br>\n<br>\n7.\nLegal basis of processing\n<br>\n<br>\nUnless otherwise specified in the description of the relevant data processing action in Section B below, the following provisions apply for this Privacy Policy.\n<br>\n<br>\nArticle 6, Paragraph 1, letter a of the GDPR serves as the legal basis upon which Kings Road Merch GmbH performs such processing.\nIn this connection, consent must be acquired for a certain processing purpose.\nIf the processing of personal data is required for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, processing is based on Article 6, Paragraph 1, Letter b of the GDPR.\nThe same applies to any processing actions that are required to perform pre-contractual activities, for instance in relation to enquiries regarding our products &amp.\nservices.\nWhere Kings Road Merch GmbH is subject to a legal obligation that necessitates the processing of personal data, processing is based on Article 6, Paragraph 1, Letter c of the GDPR.\nIn rare cases, it may be necessary to process personal data in order to safeguard the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person, in which case processing is based on Article 6, Paragraph 1, Letter d of the GDPR.\nFinally, processing actions may be based on Article 6, Paragraph 1, Letter f of the GDPR.\nThis legal basis permits processing that is not encompassed by any of the previously stated legal bases, as long as the processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of Kings Road Merch GmbH or a third party, unless outweighed by the interests, fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms of the data subject.\nSuch processing is in particular permitted because it is specifically mentioned by the European legislative (see Recital 47, Sentence 2 of the GDPR).\n<br>\n<br>\n8.\nAccommodation of legitimate interests <br>\n<br>\nUnless otherwise governed in the description of the relevant data processing action in Section B of this Privacy Policy and where processing of personal data is based on Article 6, Paragraph 1, Letter f of the GDPR, our legitimate interest lies in the performance of our business operations and the associated economic interest.\n<br>\n<br>\n9.\nData protection when using our contact details\n<br>\n<br>\nIf you use the contact details specified on our website to contact us (for instance our email address or fax number), the personal data that you transmit in this connection will only be processed for the purpose of the contact.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf the reason for your contact is to express interest in our products or services or if it relates to the performance of an existing contract with us, processing is performed on the basis of Article 6, Paragraph 1, Letter b of the GDPR.\nIn all other contact scenarios, we have a legitimate interest in accordance with Article 6, Paragraph 1, Letter f of the GDPR in processing data in order to continue the communication initiated by you.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe store the data required for the performance of the contract until expiry of the statutory warranty and (where relevant) contractual guarantee periods.\nWe retain data required under commercial and tax law for the periods of time specified by statute, which is normally ten years (see Section 257 of the German Commercial Code and Section 147 of the German Fiscal Code).\nData processed for the performance of pre-contractual activities will be deleted as soon as the measures have been completed and it is apparent that it will not result in the conclusion of a contract.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe personal data that we store on the basis of a legitimate interest will be stored until the purpose of the contact has been fulfilled.\nYou are entitled at any time on grounds relating to your particular circumstances to object to the processing of data that is performed on the basis of Article 6, Paragraph 1, Letter f of the GDPR and is not performed for the purpose of direct marketing.\nWhere data is processed for direct marketing purposes, on the other hand, you can object to this processing at any time without specifying grounds.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe recipients of personal data processed on this legal basis are IT service providers (in particular hosters) with whom we have concluded Data Processing Agreements in accordance with Article 28 of the GDPR.\n<br>\n<br>\n10.\nData protection in relation to job applications and during applicant selection procedures <br>\n<br>\nWe collect and process the personal data of applicants for the purpose of conducting applicant selection procedures.\nThis therefore constitutes a pre-contractual activity within the meaning of Article 6, Paragraph 1, Letter b of the GDPR.\n<br>\n<br>\nData may be processed electronically, for instance when an applicant sends corresponding application documents to us digitally, for example by email or through our contact form.\nIf we conclude an employment agreement with an applicant, the transmitted data will be stored for the purpose of governing the employment relationship in accordance with statutory requirements.\nIf no employment agreement is concluded with the applicant by the data controller, the application documents will be automatically erased six months after sending the rejection correspondence, unless there are other legitimate interests of the data controller opposing erasure.\nAnother example of a legitimate interest in this context might be an obligation to provide evidence in proceedings under the General Equal Treatment Act.\n<br>\n<br>\nWhere incoming applications are received in digital form, the recipients of the processed personal data are our IT service providers (in particular hosters), with whom we have concluded corresponding Data Processing Agreements in accordance with Article 28 of the GDPR.\n<br>\n<br>\n11.\nAmendments to this Privacy Policy <br>\n<br>\nKings Road Merch GmbH reserves the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time with future effect.\nThe current version is available on the website.\nPlease visit the website regularly and find out about the relevant Privacy Policy.\n<br>\n<br>\nB.\nSpecific provisions regarding the processing of data on our website\n<br>\n<br>\n1.\nCollection and usage of your data\n<br>\n<br>\nThe scope and nature of how your data is collected and used will vary depending on whether you only visit our website to access information or wish to make use of services that we offer, for instance by concluding a contract via the website.\n<br>\n<br>\n2.\nInformational usage/collected data/cookies <br>\n<br>\n\"This website uses cookies.\nFind out more in our Privacy Policy about how we use cookies, and about how you can modify your settings and disable cookies.\nOK\"\n<br>\n<br>\n(1) When using our website for solely informational purposes, i.e.\nif you do not submit an order through our website or send us information in any other way, we will only collect the personal data that your browser sends to our server.\nIf you wish to view our website, we collect the following data, which we require on technical grounds to allow our website to be displayed to you and to ensure its stability and security (legal basis: Article 6, Paragraph 1, Sentence 1, Letter f GDPR): <br>\n<br>- IP

days for the specified purposes and then deleted.\n<br>\n<br>\n(3) In addition to the aforementioned data, cookies will also be stored on your device when you use our website.\nThis is based on our legitimate interest in the optimisation and cost-effective operation of our online service pursuant to Article 6, Paragraph 1, Letter f of the GDPR.\nCookies are small text files stored on your hard drive under their associated browser to allow certain information to be supplied via the entity setting the cookie (in this case us).\nCookies are unable to execute programs or transmit viruses onto your computer.\nTheir purpose is to make the web service more user-friendly and more effective on the whole.\n<br>\n<br>\n(4) Use of cookies: <br>\n<br> a)\tOur website uses the following types of cookie, the scope and function of which are described below:\n<br>\n<br>\n- Transient cookies (see b)<br>\n<br>\n- Persistent cookies (see c)\n<br>\n<br> b)\tTransient cookies are automatically deleted when you close your browser - this especially concerns session cookies which store the \"session ID\" that allows various requests from your browser to be allocated to the shared session.\nThis allows your device to be recognised again when you return to our website.\nSession cookies are deleted when you log out or close your browser.\n<br>\n<br> c)\tPersistent cookies are automatically deleted after a specified period, which will vary depending on the cookie and can be several years.\nYou can delete the cookies in your browser's security settings at any

visit.\n<br>\n<br> f)\tThe Flash cookies we use are not registered by your browser, but by your Flash plug-in.\nWe also use HTML5 storage objects that are stored on your end device.\nThese objects store the required data regardless of the browser that you are using and do not have an automatic expiry date.\nIf you do not wish for Flash cookies to be used, you will need to install an appropriate add-on such as \"Better Privacy\" for Mozilla Firefox (https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/betterprivacy/) or Adobe Flash Killer Cookie for Google Chrome.\nYou can prevent the use of HTML5 storage objects by setting privacy mode in your browser.\nWe also recommend deleting your cookies and browser history on a regular basis.\n<br>\n<br> (5) The recipients of the data processed in accordance with the above paragraphs are IT service providers (in particular hosters), with whom we have concluded corresponding Data Processing Agreements in accordance with Article 28 of the GDPR.\n<br>\n<br>\n3.\nGoogle Analytics (with anonymisation function) <br>\n<br>Based on our legitimate interests (i.e.\nour interest in the analysis, optimisation and cost-effective operation of our online service pursuant to Article 6, Paragraph 1, Letter f of the GDPR), we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service of Google Ireland Limited, Google Building Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland (\"Google\").\nGoogle makes use of cookies.\nThe information generated by the cookies about how the web service is used by the user is usually transmitted to a Google server located in the USA and stored there.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe use the \"_gat._anonymizeIp\" option for web analytics using \"Google Analytics\".\nThis option truncates the IP address of the data subject's internet connection and anonymises it when our web pages are accessed from a member state of the European Union or from another signatory of the Agreement on the European Economic Area.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe purpose of the Google Analytics component is to enable analysis of visitor traffic on our website.\nGoogle uses the acquired data and information to analyse usage of our website for the purpose of preparing online reports for us that illustrate activity on our web pages and to provide other services related to the use of our website.\n<br>\n<br>\nGoogle Analytics sets a cookie on the end device of the data subject.\nThis cookie enables Google to analyse usage of our website.\nAny access to one of the individual pages of our website in which the Google Analytics component is integrated causes the web browser on the end device of the data subject to send information to Google for the purpose of this online analysis.\nThis behaviour is brought about by the Google Analytics component.\nDuring this machine-based process, Google will obtain personal data such as the IP address of the data subject, which Google uses among other things to track the origin of traffic, monitor clicks and as a result calculate commission.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe cookie is used to store personal information, for example the time of access, the location from which the site was accessed, and the frequency of access of our website by the data subject.\nUpon each visit to our web pages, this personal data, including the IP address of the internet connection used by the data subject, will be transmitted to Google Inc.\nin the USA.\nThis personal data will probably be stored permanently by Google Inc.\nin the USA.\nGoogle Inc.\nmay forward this personal data, which is collected by machine-based methods, to third parties.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe data subject can prevent cookies from being set by our website at any time by configuring the used web browser accordingly, thereby permanently blocking the cookie from being set.\nConfiguring the web browser in this way would also prevent Google from setting a cookie on the IT system of the data subject.\nA cookie previously set by Google Analytics can also be deleted at any time through the web browser or using other software tools.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe data subject also has the option to object and prevent the collection of the data generated by Google Analytics in relation to the use of our website and the processing of this data by Google, for which the data subject must install a browser add-on under the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.\nThis browser add-on notifies Google Analytics through JavaScript that no data or information on visits to websites may be transmitted to Google Analytics.\nThe installation of the browser add-on will be understood by Google as an opt-out.\nIf the data on the data subject's end device is deleted, formatted or reinstalled at a later time, the data subject will need to reinstall the browser add-on to disable Google Analytics.\nIf the browser add-on is uninstalled or disabled by the data subject or another person within the data subject's sphere of influence, there is the option of reinstalling or re-enabling the browser add-on.\n<br>\n<br>\nFurther information on Google's current Privacy Policy is available at https://www.google.de/intl/en/policies/privacy/ and at https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/gb.html <br>\n<br>\nGoogle Analytics is explained in more detail at https://www.google.com/intl/en_gb/analytics/.\n<br>\n<br>\n4.\nUse of services on our website\n<br>\n<br>\nHowever, if you wish to make use of services offered on our website, for instance by purchasing something in our online shop or using the contact form, it will be necessary to provide personal data.\nSpecifics on this can be found in the provisions below.\n<br>\n<br>\n4.1\tPurpose of data processing <br>\n<br>(1) Your personal data that you provide during the order process is required to establish a contract with us (e.g.\ncontract party details) and is also required by law (e.g.\ntax regulations).\nFailure to provide personal data would make it impossible to conclude the contract with you.\nFor certain payment methods, we require the necessary payment details to forward to our payment service provider.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf you send us an enquiry by email or via the contact form before the contract is concluded, or if you conclude a contract through our website, we will process the data received in this manner to perform pre-contractual activities, for instance by answering your questions on our services or products.\n<br>\n<br>\nYou can voluntarily create a customer account that will enable us to store your data for later purchases.\nBy creating an account under \"My account\", the data that you provide you will revocably stored.\nAll other data, including your user account, can always be deleted in the customer account section.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe data that you provide will therefore be processed for the purpose of fulfilling the contract or performing pre-contractual activities in accordance with Article 6, Paragraph 1, Letter b of the GDPR and for compliance with legal obligations in accordance with Article 6, Paragraph 1, Letter c of the GDPR.\n<br>\n<br>\n(2) The recipients of the personal data processed in accordance with this provision are payment service providers, delivery service providers, IT service providers (in particular hosters) and enterprise resource planning systems, with whom we have concluded corresponding Data Processing Agreements in accordance with Article 28 of the GDPR.\n<br>\n<br>\n(3) We store the data required for the performance of the contract until expiry of the statutory warranty and (where relevant) contractual guarantee periods.\nWe retain data required under commercial and tax law for the periods of time specified by statute, which is normally ten years (see Section 257 of the German Commercial Code and Section 147 of the German Fiscal Code).\nData processed for the performance of

and the click ID (which specifically identifies your email address and the specific email dispatch), your IP address or DNS name and the time it was accessed.\nThis information is used to improve the technical aspects of the services by referencing the technical data or target groups and their reading behaviour according to their access locations (which are identifiable based on IP addresses) or access times.\nThe collection of data for statistical purpose also includes identifying whether the newsletter has been opened, when it was opened and which links were clicked on.\nWhile this information can be attributed to individual newsletter recipients for technical reasons, it is not our own to observe individual users.\nThese analyses help us to identify our users' reading habits and adapt our content to them to send different context to cater to our users' interests.\n<br>\n<br>\n(4) The legal basis for the processing of your personal data is provided by the consent that you
