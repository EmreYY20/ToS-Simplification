life to the designated system.\nIt is necessary for us to collect, share, and analyze information about the users to improve the Services and serve the community better.</p>\n<p>We believe that it is important to protect personal information of users, not only because it is a legal and moral obligation and observing it is critical for the being of the Services, but also because participants need to feel safe and respected to work collectively with others.\nDealing with information in a user-friendly and protective way necessarily comes with transparency.\nUse of any information from the Services will be solely for the purpose of serving its vision: breaking down barriers in academia.\nThat is, we will be using information only to make the Services work better for you, the researchers, and to enable a better environment for researchers to pursue genuine knowledge.</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy (\"this Privacy Policy\") explains types of information we collect from you, how we collect them, and how we use them.\nIt is important to understand that by using any or all of the Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.\nWe therefore ask you please read this Privacy Policy carefully for the protection of users like yourself, the Services, and us.\nIf you do not

to publications is in general important for the Services, users, and their studies.\nAmong various pieces of personal information relevant to a publication record, we believe, to the extent permitted by applicable law and the correspondent license under which the record is shared, at least the real names of authors, their affiliations, and their bibliographic metrics such as h-index and received citations are academic information.</p>\n<p>We collect author names as publicly accessible metadata from the web, publishers and other sources for display across our website including in association with papers, presentations, blog posts, code repositories, videos and citations/references.\nThis data and content is stored indefinitely.\nWe use the author name from this publicly accessible

by using the \u201cSuggest Changes\u201d button on an author\u2019s profile page to add/remove papers, add an affiliation, add a link to a homepage, add an email address, and add other information that is relevant to the author.\nRequesters who submit changes are required to provide their first and last name, email address and justification which we store in a database to validate the

and/or disclose your personal information if we reasonably believe it necessary to satisfy a valid and legally enforceable warrant, subpoena, court order, law or regulation, or other judicial or administrative order.\nHowever, if we believe that a particular request for disclosure of a user's information is legally invalid or an abuse of the legal system and the affected user does not intend to oppose the disclosure themselves, we will try our best to fight it.\nWe are committed to notifying you of such request when possible, before we disclose your personal information in response to a legal demand.\nHowever, we may only provide notice if we are not legally restrained from contacting you, there is no credible threat to life or limb that is created or increased by disclosing the
