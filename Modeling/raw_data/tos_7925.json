"//body", "text": " <strong>www.sumofiber.com</strong>SUMOFIBERKnowledge Base<strong>For public use, with restrictions</strong>Master Service Agreement<p>\n<strong>I.\nINTRODUCTION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This Subscriber Agreement (\"Agreement\") sets forth the terms and conditions governing the purchase and use of CALLUTAH, LLC and its affiliated companies' (collectively \"Sumo Fiber\") products and services including, but not limited to, Sumo Fiber voice, data, and video service.\nThis Agreement also sets forth the terms and conditions governing the rental or use of Sumo Fiber equipment including, but not limited to, set-top boxes, television remote controls, video cables, power cables, uninterruptable power supplies, fiber optic home gateways, voice integrated access devices, and voice terminal adapters.\nFor purposes of this Agreement, \"Subscriber\" means the customer or consumer of Sumo Fiber services and \"Provider\" means Sumo Fiber and its affiliated companies.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>II.\nTRANSFER LIMITS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Residential bandwidth transfer limits unlimited usage.</p>\n<p>Legecy Small Business bandwidth transfer limits are set to 200 Gigabyte/month.\nBandwidth transfers measure the amount of traffic sent through Subscriber's connection on a monthly basis.\nOnce bandwidth transfers exceed the 200 Gigabyte/month limit, Provider reserves the right to bill $75.00 per 50 Gig thereafter to Subscriber.<u>\n<em>&nbsp;*This product is no longer sold*</em>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>Business GOLD plans have no transfer limits.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>III.\nUSE OF SERVICE AND DEVICE</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If Subscriber subscribes to Provider's residential service plans, Provider provides Subscriber with service and the device solely for single family, normal residential, non-commercial use.\nSingle family refers to Subscriber and those of Subscriber's immediate family members who reside in Subscriber's personal residence - e.g., spouse, domestic partner, and/or children.\nIf Subscriber subscribes to a service plan which permits use of more than one device with the same voice line, the basis for assessing such use will not change.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>IV.\nINCONSISTENT WITH NORMAL USE</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If Subscriber uses the service or the device in a way that is inconsistent with the normal use for Subscriber's service or plan, Subscriber will be required, at Provider's sole discretion, to pay the rates for the service or plan that would apply to the way Subscriber used the service or device, or terminate the plan.\nFor example, if Subscriber subscribes to one of Provider's residential service plans, and Subscriber's usage is inconsistent with normal residential use, Subscriber may thereafter be required to pay Provider's applicable, higher rates for commercial service for all periods in which Subscriber's use of Provider's service or the device was inconsistent with normal residential use.\nUnlimited voice services are provided primarily for continuous live dialog between two individuals.\nLack of continuous dialog activity, unusual call patterns, excessive numbers and/or consistent excessive usage (i.e., more than 3,000 minutes per line per month for unlimited residential calling) will be considered indicators that use may be inconsistent with normal use, or that impermissible use may be occurring and may trigger an account review by Provider.\nThe creation or use of related multiple accounts or excessive residential lines to circumvent these levels shall also be considered indicators that use of the service may be inconsistent with normal use for the subscribed monthly plan(s) and may trigger an account review by Provider.\nFailure to contact Provider in response to its notifications and/or failure to promptly correct usage activity to conform to normal use will result in immediate mandatory transfer to another appropriate plan, suspension, or termination of service at Provider's sole discretion.\nSubscriber acknowledges that if Subscriber's service is terminated under this provision, Subscriber is subject to all applicable disconnection, termination, and device or other rebate recovery charges.\nProvider's right to terminate Subscriber's account under Section K (2) (with or without reason) is not limited by this provision.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>V.\nACCEPTANCE</strong>\n</p>\n<p>BY SUBSCRIBING TO, USING, OR PAYING FOR PROVIDER'S PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, SUBSCRIBER AGREES TO THE PRICES, CHARGES, TERMS, AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT.\nTHIS AGREEMENT BECOMES BINDING UPON SUBSCRIBER WHEN SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBES TO, USES, OR PAYS FOR ANY OF PROVIDER'S PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.\nIF SUBSCRIBER DOES NOT AGREE TO THESE PRICES, CHARGES, TERMS, OR CONDITIONS, SUBSCRIBER SHOULD NOT USE ANY OF PROVIDER'S PRODUCTS OR SERVICES AND MUST IMMEDIATELY CANCEL THE SERVICES BY CALLING PROVIDER AT (801) 320-1000 AND COMPLETING A CANCELLATION REQUEST FORM.\nSUBSCRIBER WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY AND ALL CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH ANY OF PROVIDER'S PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT SUBSCRIBER USES.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>VI.\nCONTENTS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This Agreement incorporates by reference the Sumo Fiber Customer Activation Form, Sumo Fiber Acceptable Use Policy (\"AUP\"), Sumo Fiber Privacy Policy, and Sumo Fiber Electronic Billing Notice.\nA violation of any of these policies or agreements constitutes a violation of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>A.\nProducts and Services Offering.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Provider offers its products and services to Subscribers in the following manner:</p>\n<p>1.\nStandard Offerings.\nProvider's Standard Offerings, including features and pricing, are contained on the standard pricing page.\nSubscriber may subscribe to Provider's Standard Offerings by filling-out, signing, and returning a Customer Activation Form to Provider or by calling Provider.\nIn the event that any term or condition on the Customer Activation Form conflicts with the terms and conditions on Provider's website, Provider's website governs.\nProvider offers its Standard Offerings on a month-to-month basis.\nUnless Subscriber notifies Provider in writing of Subscriber's desire to terminate, the terms and conditions (including Subscriber's obligation to pay) of Provider's Standard Offerings will automatically renew each month.\nProvider reserves the right to change its Standard Offerings, including the price of the standard offerings, at any time with or without notice to Subscriber.</p>\n<p>2.\nPromotional Offerings.\nFrom time to time, Provider may offer Promotional Offerings.\nProvider's Promotional Offerings, including features and pricing, are contained on the standard pricing page.\nSubscriber may subscribe to Promotional Offerings by filling-out, signing, and returning a Customer Activation Form containing the Promotional Offerings to Provider or by calling Provider.\nIn the event that any term or condition on the Customer Activation Form conflicts with the terms and conditions on Provider's website, Provider's website governs.\nUnless specifically stated otherwise, Promotional Offerings are offered as a discount from the price of the Standard Offering.\nUnless Subscriber has received a Promotional Offering that designates a specific price, rather than a discount, changes in price to the Standard Offering as described above may affect the price of the Promotional Offering.\nSubscriber acknowledges that Provider may change, modify, or revoke Promotional Offerings at any time and that Subscriber may not be eligible for all Promotional Offerings.\nTo the extent that a Promotional Offering requires Subscriber to maintain Provider's products or services for a certain length of time, Subscriber agrees to maintain and pay for Provider's products or services for that length of time.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>B.\nUse and Availability of Products and Services.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>1.\nIf the products or services that Provider delivers to Subscriber are different than the products or services that Subscriber selected, Subscriber shall immediately notify Provider.\nSubscriber will be responsible for any and all charges associated with any products or services that Subscriber uses

to use Provider's products and services for personal residential purposes only.\nSubscriber shall not use Provider's products or services for any business (including non-profit business), professional, high-volume, commercial, or governmental purposes or for any purposes that are inconsistent with normal residential usage.\nSubscriber shall not resell Provider's products or services to any third party or otherwise enable, facilitate, or allow any third party to use or access Provider's products or services including, but not limited to, allowing third parties to access Provider's products and services via a wireless router or access point.\nIf Provider discovers that Subscriber has used Provider's products and services for any non-residential purposes other than incidental business, professional or commercial use, Provider may, along with all other remedies available to Provider, charge Subscriber and Subscriber hereby agrees to pay, the non-residential rate for Provider's products and services that Subscriber used.</p>\n<p>3.\nProvider's products and services may not be available in all areas or at the rates, speeds, or bandwidth generally marketed.\nProvider provides products and services on a per line basis (not per device basis).\nSubscriber acknowledges and agrees that the performance of Provider's products and services will vary depending on a number of factors such as the number, type, and configuration of devices and the manner in which the devices use Provider's network.\nThe speed of Provider's products and services will vary based on network or internet congestion, Subscriber's computer configuration, the condition of the voice, video or data lines, and the wiring inside Subscriber's location.\nProvider reserves the right, at any time, with or without prior notice to Subscriber, to restrict or suspend Provider's products or services to perform maintenance activities and to maintain session control.</p>\n<p>4.\nProvider's products and services are only offered and delivered to the service address designated by Subscriber at the time Subscriber subscribes to service.\nOnce Provider performs the installation at the service address, Subscriber may not change the service address.\nIf Subscriber moves from the service address to another residence in an area in which Provider provides service, Subscriber may request Provider to transfer services to the new address.\nTransfer fees, installation fees, contract renewal, or a new contract may be required to transfer service addresses.\nProvider reserves the right to deny any transfer requests for any reason.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>C.\nCharges and Payments.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>1.\nAgreement to Pay and Prices.\nSubscriber hereby agrees to pay Provider for the products and services to which Subscriber has subscribed and for the products and services that Subscriber uses.\nSubscriber hereby agrees to pay all surcharges, recovery fees, activation fees, installation fees, set-up fees, equipment fees, early termination fees, and other recurring and nonrecurring fees, as applicable.\nSubscriber hereby acknowledges and agrees that Subscriber is responsible for the use of Provider's products or services, whether by Subscriber or someone using Subscriber's account with or without Subscriber's permission.</p>\n<p>2.\nPay By Due Date.\nSubscriber hereby agrees to pay all bills and invoices on or before the due date listed on the bill or invoice.\nIf Subscriber elects to pay any bills or invoices with an automatic credit card charge or ACH transaction, Subscriber agrees and acknowledges that Provider may charge Subscriber's credit card or process the ACH transaction before the due date listed on the bills or invoices including, but not limited to, the statement date of the bills or invoices.\nIf automatic credit card charge or ACH transaction fails Provider will continue to retry authorization attempts monthly for (1) one year.\nSubscriber agrees to pay all bills and invoices in U.S.\ncurrency.\nProvider does not waive its right to collect the full amount due if Subscriber pays late or pays only part of the amount due, even if Subscriber writes \"Paid in Full\" or similar words on any correspondence or payment to Provider.</p>\n<p>3.\nLate Fees and Collections Fees.\nIf Subscriber fails to pay a bill or invoice on or before the due date listed on the bill or invoice, Provider may, as allowed by law, charge a late fee of $10 per month while there is a past due amount or 2% per month of the past due amount, whichever is greater.\nIf state or federal law requires a different fee or interest rate, Provider will charge that amount and apply that rate.\nIn the event any amount(s) is/are referred to a third party debt collection agency, Subscriber hereby agrees, that in addition to any other amount(s) allowed for by law (such as interest, court costs, reasonable attorney's fees, etc.), Subscriber will also be responsible for a collection fee of up to 40% of the principal amount(s) owed as allowed by Utah Code Annotated, sec.\n12-1-11.</p>\n<p>4.\nReturned Checks.\nIf Subscriber's check, bank draft, or electronic funds transfer is returned for insufficient funds or if Subscriber's credit card fails to honor any charges, Provider may charge Subscriber an additional fee of up to $50.00.\nIf state or federal law requires a different fee, Provider will charge that amount.</p>\n<p>5.\nPrepaid Services.\nProvider offers services, except voice long distance and video on demand charges, on a prepaid basis only.\nAccordingly, Provider will bill and collect payment for products and services, except voice long distance usage and video on demand charges, in advance.\nTo determine the charge for voice long distance usage, Provider will round up to the next full minute for any fraction of minutes used.</p>\n<p>6.\nFormat of Bill.\nProvider will determine the format of the bills or invoices and the billing period for Subscriber.\nProvider may change both the format of the bills or invoices and the billing period from time to time with or without notice to Subscriber.</p>\n<p>7.\nBilling Disputes.\nExcept as may be required by any applicable laws or regulations, any and all billing inquiries or disputes must be referred to Provider within 30 days from the date the disputed charges first appeared on Subscriber's bill or invoice.\nSubscriber shall pay Provider the undisputed portion of the bill on or before the due date to avoid disconnection of services for non-payment.\nSubscriber may contact Provider by sending an email to billing@sumofiber.com, by calling (801) 320-1000, or by

(MSA) between Customer and SUMOFIBER.\n&nbsp;Capitalized terms used herein that are not defined in this SLA shall have the meaning attributed to them in the MSA.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nQUALIFICATION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Service level agreements are available to customers who purchase GOLD and small business data products.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Residential customers do not quality.</u>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\nVOICE SERVICE</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Service Level Agreement (SLA) is effective as of the first day of the second month after initial installation of Services.\n&nbsp;The goals associated with Voice Availability, SLAs set forth below are measured using monthly averages of the SUMOFIBER Voice Network.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nVOICE AVAILABILITY</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Voice Availability Goal for SUMOFIBER Local Service is 99.9%.\nVoice availability is based on \u201cNetwork Downtime\u201d, which exists when a particular circuit of customer is unable to transmit and receive voice calls.\n&nbsp;Such failure is recorded in SUMOFIBER\u2019s &nbsp;trouble ticket system.\n&nbsp;Network Downtime is measured from the time the trouble ticket is opened to the time the affected Service is again able to transmit and receive Voice calls.\n&nbsp;Any delay times associated with SUMOFIBER\u2019s ability to access the Customer\u2019s premises will be subtracted from the total Network Downtime.\u201d &nbsp;In the event SUMOFIBER does not meet this Voice Availability Service Level, subject to the restrictions and exclusions in Section 4 below, Customer\u2019s exclusive remedy shall be a service credit off of the MRC (monthly recurring charge) associated with the affected Service based on the SLA in excess of this Service Level in the particular month as set forth in the following table not to exceed 25% of customer monthly billing:</p>\n<p>\n<u>SLA Service Level &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nCredit</u>\n</p>\n<p>98-99.89% &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;5%</p>\n<p>96-97.99%

as of the first day of the second month after initial Installation of Services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nDATA NETWORK AVAILABILITY</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Network Availability is defined as the ability to pass incoming and outgoing traffic through SUMOFIBER\u2019s network.\n&nbsp;The Data Availability Goal for SUMOFIBER Data Service is 99.9%.\n&nbsp;Data availability is based on \u201cNetwork Downtime\u201d, which exists when a particular circuit of customer is unable to transmit and receive Data.\n&nbsp;Such failure is recorded in SUMOFIBER &nbsp;trouble ticket system.\n&nbsp;Network Downtime is measured from the time the trouble ticket is opened to the time the affected Service is again able to transmit and receive Data.\n&nbsp;In the event SUMOFIBER does not meet this Data Availability Service Level, subject to the restrictions and exclusions in Section 3 below, Customer\u2019s exclusive remedy shall be a service credit off of the MRC associated with the affected Service based on the SLA in excess of this Service Level in the particular month as set forth in the following table not to exceed 25% of customer monthly billing:</p>\n<p>\n<u>SLA Service Level &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nCredit</u>\n</p>\n<p>98-99.89% &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;5%</p>\n<p>96-97.99%

Data Service is 99.9%.\n&nbsp;Packet Delivery will be measured on an ongoing basis every five minutes to adequately determine a consistent average monthly performance level for packets actually delivered between SUMOFIBER Gateways on the SUMOFIBER IP network.\nSuch failure is recorded in SUMOFIBER &nbsp;trouble ticket system.\n&nbsp;In the event SUMOFIBER does not meet this Data Packet Delivery Service Level, subject to the restrictions and exclusions listed in section 3, Customer\u2019s exclusive remedy shall be a service credit off of the MRC associated with the affected Service based on the SLA in excess of this Service Level in the particular month as set forth in the following table not to exceed 25% of customer monthly billing:</p>\n<p>\n<u>SLA Service Level

via roundtrip pings on an ongoing basis every five minutes to adequately determine a consistent average monthly performance level for Latency at the relevant POPs.\nLatency is calculated as follows:</p>\n<p>A.\nComponents Included.\nThe average network delay (\u201cLatency\u201d) will be measured via roundtrip pings on an ongoing basis every five minutes to adequately determine a consistent average monthly performance level for Latency at the relevant POPs.\nLatency is calculated as follows:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.\nMAINTENANCE</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cNormal Maintenance\u201d refers to upgrades of hardware or software or upgrades to increase capacity.\nNormal Maintenance may temporarily degrade the quality of the Service, including possible outages.\n&nbsp;Such effects related to Normal Maintenance will not give rise to service credits under this SLA.\nNormal Maintenance will be undertaken only as follows: (a) between the hours of 12 midnight and 6:00 AM Local Time.\n&nbsp;For purposes of this SLA, \u201cLocal Time\u201d refers to the local time in the time zone in which an Affected Service is located.\n&nbsp;\u201cUrgent Maintenance\u201d refers to efforts to correct network conditions that are likely to cause a material Service outage and that require immediate action.\n&nbsp;Urgent Maintenance may degrade that quality of the Services, including possible outages.\n&nbsp;Such effects related to Urgent Maintenance will entitle Customer to service credits as set forth in this SLA.\n&nbsp;SUMOFIBER may undertake Urgent Maintenance at any time deemed necessary and will provide notice of Urgent Maintenance to Customer as soon as is commercially practicable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.\nLimitations</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding anything in this Service Schedule to the contrary, Customer will not be entitled to a service credit for an outage that is the direct result of any network failure associated with the local loop or any other facilities that are not owned, operated or controlled by SUMOFIBER.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.\nCustomer Termination Rights</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Customer may terminate the Affected Services without early termination charges if, in any single calendar month: (a) Network Downtime exists for at least Sixty (60) hours in the aggregate.\nor (b) any single event entitling Customer to credits under Network Availability exists for a period of at least thirty six (36) consecutive hours.\n&nbsp;Such termination must be conducted by written notice to SUMOFIBER, and no later than five business days following the end of the relevant calendar month.\notherwise, Customer waives its rights to termination based on subsection (a) or (b) herein.\n&nbsp;After receipt of written notice of termination such termination will be effective after services have been transferred to another service provider.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.\nExclusive Remedy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Given that damages from service interruptions or other failures to provide the Service under this SLA would be impossible to ascertain, and that the remedies stated in this SLA have been determined as a reasonable estimate of compensation, and not as a penalty, Customer\u2019s remedy shall be fixed and liquidated as set forth in this SLA.\n&nbsp;In no event will the total remedies available to Customer exceed those set forth in this SLA.\n&nbsp;The provisions of this SLA state Customer\u2019s sole and exclusive remedies for Service interruptions or Service deficiencies of any kind whatsoever.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.\nRemedies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Each Service outage is treated as a discrete event.\ntherefore,

credit.\nIn order to request SLA credits, Customer must contact SUMOFIBER Customer Service.\nIn order to receive service credits set forth herein, such requests shall be made no later than five business days following the last day of the month in which the relevant SLA was not met.\n&nbsp;Failure to comply with these service credit request requirements will forfeit your right to receive a credit.\n&nbsp;A credit will be applied only to the month in which the event giving rise to the credit occurred.\n&nbsp;The maximum SLA credits issued in any one calendar month will not exceed: 25% of the MRCs of the Affected Service with respect to the SLA.\n\u201cAffected Service\u201d refers to the particular Product that fails to meet the relevant SLA.\n&nbsp;In no event will the total credit, in the aggregate for all credits issued in one month exceed the equivalent of 25% of the relevant MRCs for the Affected Service.\n&nbsp;The Customer may not deduct or set-off a service credit, if any, from an invoice, but must, in all cases, wait for the invoice to reflect the service credit before the Customer can realize it.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.\nService Credit Exceptions</strong>\n</p>\n<p>An
