Policy, you may not access or use the Service, and you must immediately cease accessing or using the Service.</b>\n1.4.\n<b>\n<u>Arbitration and Remedies</u>.\nThese terms contain a mandatory arbitration of disputes provision that requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or class actions, and also limits the remedies available to you in the event of a dispute.\nSee below for full details.</b>\n<br>\n<br>\n2.\n<u>Dispute Resolution</u>.\nBy using the Service, you consent to the collection and use of certain information about you, as specified in the Privacy Policy discussed in Section 1.3 (Separate Privacy Policy).\nDaily Goodie Box encourages users of the Service to frequently check the Privacy Policy for changes.\n2.1 <u>Binding Arbitration.</u>\n<br>\n<br> 2.1.1.\nIf you and Daily Goodie Box cannot resolve a Claim through negotiations, either party may elect to have the Claim finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.&nbsp;\u201cClaim(s)\u201d shall mean all claims, actions, demands, causes of action, and other proceedings, including but not limited to legal costs and fees.\n<b>Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other(s).</b> 2.1.2.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate.&nbsp;The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted through JAMS (www.jamsadr.com)&nbsp;under the Streamlined Rules, as modified by this agreement to arbitrate.\nAll remedies available to the parties under applicable federal, state, or local laws shall remain available in arbitration.\nThe parties shall each participate in the selection of a neutral arbitrator pursuant to the Streamlined Rules.\nUnless you and Company agree otherwise in writing, the final arbitration hearing shall take place in person at the JAMS facility located in or nearest to your city of residence.\nIf you initiate arbitration against Company, you will be required to pay an initial fee of $250 (unless you qualify for a waiver), and all other arbitration costs (including any remaining JAMS Case Management Fee and all professional fees for the arbitrator\u2019s services) shall be paid as determined by the arbitrator.\nIf Company initiates arbitration against you, Company shall pay all costs associated with the arbitration.\nIf JAMS is unavailable to arbitrate a dispute or claim, you and Company agree to arbitrate using an alternative arbitral forum.\nRegardless of the outcome of the arbitration, you and Company will each pay your own attorney\u2019s fees and costs unless an award of attorney\u2019s fees is available under applicable statute.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award will consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each Claim.\nThe award will also provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.\nThe arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.\nEither party may litigate to compel arbitration in a Court of Competent Jurisdiction, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to modify, confirm, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n<b>You agree that without the terms above and below, you would have the right to sue in court with a jury trial or participate in a class action.</b> 2.2 <u>Waiver of Class Actions and Joinder of Claims.</u>\n<br>\n<br> 2.2.1.\n<b>You and Daily Goodie Box agree that any arbitration shall be limited to each Claim individually.\nYou and Daily Goodie Box agree that each may only bring claims against the other in your or Daily Goodie Box's individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.\nYou and Daily Goodie Box knowingly and voluntarily waive any right to proceed in a class action or representative proceeding or to join claims or sue in court with a jury.</b> 2.2.2.\nIf this specific provision is found to be unenforceable in a Court of Competent Jurisdiction, the Claim will still be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration upon the election of either party, and any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other(s).\nIn addition: (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other arbitration, and (2) there is no right for any Claim to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to employ class action procedures, and (3) there is no right of authority for any
