Inc.\n(\u201c<strong>Bountysource</strong>\u201c, \u201c<strong>we</strong>\u201d or \u201c<strong>us</strong>\u201c).\nBy using the Bountysource.com website (\u201c<strong>Site</strong>\u201c) or any of the Bountysource services (\u201c<strong>Services</strong>\u201c), you agree to all the terms and conditions of this Terms of Service (\u201c<strong>Agreement</strong>\u201c).\nIf you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to these terms and conditions, in which case the terms \u201cyou\u201d or \u201cyour\u201d shall refer to such entity.\nIf you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with these terms and conditions, you must not proceed with the registration process or use our Site or Service.</p>\n1.\nOverview\n<p>Bountysource is a platform for encouraging development in open-source projects by bringing together users and developers to solve existing development issues.\nIn this Agreement, the following terms have the following meanings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201c<strong>Backers</strong>\u201d are users that pay Bountysource to contribute to Fundraisers or Bounties.</li>\n<li>\u201c<strong>Bounties</strong>\u201d are cash rewards that Bountysource pays to Developers who first develop a successful Solution to an Issue.</li>\n<li>\u201c<strong>Committers</strong>\u201d are persons that are authorized to merge code into a Repository on behalf of an open-source project.</li>\n<li>\u201c<strong>Developers</strong>\u201d are users that try to develop Solutions and claim a Bounty, or who receive funds from Fundraisers for a particular goal.</li>\n<li>\u201c<strong>Fundraisers</strong>\u201d are fundraising campaigns for a particular defined goal.\nAny user can create a fundraiser for any purpose related to open source projects.\nThere are two types:\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cAll or Nothing\u201d Fundraisers (where the defined goal must be achieved before any cash is provided to the Developer).</li>\n<li>\u201cFlexible\u201d Fundraisers (where 90% of all cash pledged is provided to the Developer, regardless of whether the goal is met).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\u201c<strong>Issues</strong>\u201d are features, bugs, development needs or other issues that are posted on Bountysource and are in need of an open source Solution.\nAny User can define an Issue by posting the Issue on an issue tracking website such as GitHub or Bitbucket.</li>\n<li>\u201c<strong>Repositories</strong>\u201d are the applicable open source project\u2019s code repository.\nBountysource does not act as a Repository for any Solutions or open source code.</li>\n<li>\u201c<strong>Solutions</strong>\u201d are an original creation by a Developer to try and solve a particular Issue on Bountysource.\nSolutions are submitted to the applicable Repository and not directly to Bountysource.\nPersons authorized to accept and merge code will decide whether a Solution is accepted or not.</li>\n</ul>\n2.\nBounties\n<p>2.1 A Backer pays Bountysource to encourage the development of a successful Solution to an Issue.\nBountysource will then post the terms of the Bounty on the Bountysource.com website.\nBackers must provide their payment at the time they create a Bounty.\nBackers consent to Bountysource and its payments partners charging their payment card or other payment method for the amount of their payment.\nBounties are nonrefundable.\nThere is no additional fee for posting a Bounty.\nAn updated description of fees is maintained on the Bountysource&nbsp;Fees Page.</p>\n<p>2.2 Backers may create more than one Bounty on an Issue.\nOnce a Bounty has been created, Backers may not decrease or cancel it.</p>\n<p>2.3 Bounties are nonrefundable.</p>\n<p>2.4 Bountysource will pay Bounties to the first Developer whose Solution is accepted.\nBountysource reserves the right (but is not obligated) to apportion Bounties if multiple Developers present Solutions simultaneously or if a Developer submits a partial Solution.</p>\n<p>2.5 Committers, Backers and Developers and other users should not take any action in reliance on having a successful Solution until the successful Solution has been accepted by a Committer.</p>\n<p>2.6 Developers should not take any action in reliance on having a Bounty awarded until Bountysource notifies them that they have the ability to withdraw and spend the money.</p>\n<p>2.7 Because of occasional failures of payments from Backers, Bountysource cannot guarantee the full receipt of the Bounty amount pledged minus fees.</p>\n<p>2.8 Bountysource and its payments partners will remove their fees before transmitting proceeds of a Bounty to Developers.</p>\n<p>2.9 Bountysource reserves the right to reject, cancel, interrupt, remove, or suspend a Bounty at any time and for any reason.\nBountysource is not liable for any damages as a result of any of those actions.\nBountysource\u2019s policy is not to comment on the reasons for any of those actions.</p>\n<p>2.10 By participating in our Service, you agree that Bountysource\u2019s good faith decisions will be final and not grounds for claims or litigation.\nBountysource shall not be liable to you, and you hereby release us from any and all claims, for any damages resulting from or in connection with of any such determinations.\nBountysource\u2019s policy is not to comment on the reasons for any of those actions.</p>\n<p>2.11&nbsp;<strong>Submitting Solutions</strong>.\nDevelopers are responsible for properly submitting their proposed Solutions to the appropriate Repositories.\nBountysource does not receive, process or review proposed Solutions.\nIf you are a Developer, you represent, warrant and promise that any Solution provided by you or on your behalf is an original creation of yours, was prepared in accordance with the applicable open source license, and does not (directly or indirectly) infringe the intellectual property rights or other legal rights of any third party.</p>\n<p>2.12&nbsp;<strong>Selection of Winning Solutions</strong>.\nThe winning Solution will be selected by a Committer by merging code into their Repository.\nThe first merged Solution wins the Bounty.\nYou agree not to make claims against Bountysource or hold Bountysource responsible in connection with the determination of the winning Solution.</p>\n3.\nFundraisers\n<p>3.1&nbsp;<strong>Creation of Fundraisers</strong>.\nAny Bountysource user may initiate a Fundraiser, which is a financial goal to raise money for any open-source project, event or coding need.\nThe user must provide all information requested by Bountysource, which will include (but not be limited to):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fundraising goal (how much they wish to raise)</li>\n<li>Description of the project and purpose (why are they raising money)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3.2&nbsp;<strong>Posting of Fundraisers</strong>.\nUpon the user\u2019s successful establishment of the Fundraiser, Bountysource will post the Fundraiser and encourage Backers to make pledges.\nBountysource is not responsible for reviewing and approving the content of Fundraisers.\nHowever, Bountysource reserves the right to cancel, modify or reject Fundraisers at any time.</p>\n<p>3.3&nbsp;<strong>Types of Fundraisers</strong>.\nThere are two types of Fundraisers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All-or-Nothing Fundraiser \u2013 Bountysource disburses funds if, and only if, the project\u2019s purpose has been met.\nIf not, Bountysource returns 90% of funds to Backers.</li>\n<li>Flexible Fundraiser \u2013 Bountysource disburses 90% of funds as they are received, regardless of whether the project\u2019s purpose has been met.\nBacker payments to Bountysource are nonrefundable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3.4&nbsp;<strong>Rewards</strong>.\nUsers that initiate a Fundraiser are encouraged (but not required) to give rewards to Backers who financially support the Fundraiser.\nUsers are solely responsible for providing any rewards that they offer in a fair, reasonable and timely manner.\nBountysource is not responsible and assumes no liability for provision of rewards (unless expressly agreed in a writing signed by Bountysource).</p>\n<p>3.5&nbsp;<strong>Use of Funds.</strong>&nbsp;Recipients of Fundraiser monies must apply all funds solely in ways that directly advance the stated project purpose.\nIf requested by Bountysource, recipients must provide a complete and accurate accounting of the application of such funds.\nIf Bountysource determines in good faith that funds have been misapplied or used contrary to the intent as expressed in this Agreement and in the applicable Bounty or Fundraiser posting, Bountysource may demand return of some or all of the funds, and recipients shall be obligated to repay such funds within three (3) business days of such demand.</p>\n4.\nRegistration\n<p>4.1&nbsp;<strong>Registration

pre-approval for utilizing the Bountysource service if User\u2019s account falls within a high-risk compliance category.</p>\n<p>Bountysource\u2019s identity verification procedure requires the User to provide Bountysource with reliable, independent source documents, data or information (e.g., national ID, international passport, bank statement, utility bill) upon request.\nFor such purposes Bountysource reserves the right to collect User\u2019s identification information for AML Policy purposes.</p>\n<p>Bountysource will take steps to confirm the authenticity of documents and information provided by the Users.\nAll legal methods for double-checking identification information will be used and Bountysource reserves the right to investigate certain Users who have been determined to be risky or suspicious.</p>\n<p>Bountysource reserves the right to verify User\u2019s identity in an on-going basis, especially when their identification information has been changed or their activity seemed to be suspicious (unusual for the particular User).\nIn addition, Bountysource reserves the right to request up-to-date documents from the Users, even though they have passed identity verification in the past.</p>\n<p>User\u2019s identification information will be collected, stored, shared and protected strictly in accordance with the Bountysource\u2019s Privacy Policy and related regulations.</p>\n<p>Bountysource is entitled to interact with law enforcement, which are involved in prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing and other illegal activity.\nIf Bountysource suspects that a transaction is conducted for criminal money laundering or other illegal purposes, Bountysource reserves the right to report suspicious transactions to law enforcement\u2019s financial intelligence unit in the respective country.</p>\n<p>The Users are known not only by verifying their identity (who they are) but, more importantly, by analyzing their transactional patterns (what they do).\nTherefore, Bountysource relies on data analysis as a risk-assessment and suspicion detection tool.\nBountysource may perform a variety of compliance-related tasks, including capturing data, filtering, record-keeping, investigation management, and reporting.\nSystem functionalities may include check of Users against recognized \u201cblack lists\u201d (e.g.\nOFAC), aggregating transfers by multiple data points, placing Users on watch and service denial lists, opening cases for investigation where needed, sending internal communications and filling out statutory reports, if applicable.</p>\n<p>With regard to the AML Policy, Bountysource reserves the right to monitor all transactions and:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ensure that transactions of suspicious nature are reported to the proper law enforcement</li>\n<li>request the User to provide any additional information and documents in case of suspicious transactions</li>\n<li>suspend or terminate User\u2019s Account when Bountysource has reasonably suspicion that such User engaged in illegal activity</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above list is not exhaustive and Bountysource will monitor Users\u2019 transactions on an ongoing basis in order to define whether such transactions are to be reported and treated as suspicious or are to be treated as bona fide.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Effective Date of Revision: December 4th, 2017</i>\n</p>
