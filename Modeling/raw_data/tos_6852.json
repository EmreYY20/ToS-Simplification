to have any other dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Descript Service, including claims related to privacy and data security (collectively \u201cDisputes\u201d) resolved in court.\nInstead, for any Dispute that you have against us, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (\u201cNotice\u201d) to us by email at [mail@descript.com] or by certified mail addressed to Legal, 385 Grove Street, San Francisco, CA 94102.\nThe Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and

Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 20 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1, et seq.\n(the \u201cFAA\u201d), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision.\nArbitration will be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (\u201cADR Provider\u201d) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section.\nIf AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative ADR Provider.\nThe rules of the ADR Provider will govern all aspects of this arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules conflict with these Terms or as limited by the FAA (\u201cArbitration Rules\u201d).\nThe AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.\nThe arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual\u2019s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.\nAny claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than ten thousand U.S.\ndollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.\nArbitration proceedings will be held in San Francisco, California unless you are a consumer, in which case you may elect to hold the arbitration in your county of residence.\nFor claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is ten thousand U.S.\ndollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules.\nAny judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Any Dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim arose.\notherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and we will not have the right to assert the claim.</strong>\n<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Additional Rules for Non-appearance Based Arbitration.\n</strong>If non-appearance arbitration is elected as provided above, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, and/or based solely on written submissions.\nthe specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.\nThe arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Authority of the Arbitrator.\n</strong>The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and us, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.\nThe arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.\nThe arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and these Terms.\nThe arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.\nThe arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.\nThe award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Fees.\n</strong>You and we agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer), and we will pay the remaining AAA fees and costs.\nFor any arbitration initiated by us, we will pay all AAA fees and costs.\n<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Waiver of Jury Trial.\n</strong>YOU AND US HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes will be resolved by arbitration under this Section.\nArbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.\nIn the event any litigation should arise between you and us in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND US WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.\n</strong>ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS SECTION MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER.\nNotwithstanding any other provision in these Terms, in the event that this subparagraph is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither party is entitled to arbitration and instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court located in San Francisco County, California.<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Confidentiality.\n</strong>The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute.\nNo part of the procedures will be open to the public or the media.\nAll evidence discovered or submitted at the hearing is confidential and may not be disclosed, except by written agreement of the parties, pursuant to court order or unless required by law.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, no party will be prevented from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Section, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Right to Waive.\n</strong>Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Section may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted.\nSuch waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this Section.<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Courts.\n</strong>In any circumstances where the foregoing Section permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in San Francisco, California, for such purpose.<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Survival.\n</strong>This Section will survive the termination of your relationship with us.\nIf any portion of this Section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms.\n(b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section or the parties\u2019 ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section.\nand (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.\nFurther, if any part of this Section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section will be enforceable.<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Opt-Out - You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days

representations or warranties on behalf of any other party, whether express or implied, or to bind the other party in any respect whatsoever.\nExcept as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.\nNotwithstanding any other provisions of these Terms,
