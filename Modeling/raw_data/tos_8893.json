DoubleClick by Google.\nDoubleClick uses cookies to display adverts that are relevant to the user, to improve reports on campaign performance, and to avoid users being shown the same adverts multiple times.\nVia a cookie ID, Google records which adverts are displayed in which browser and is thus able to prevent the adverts from being shown multiple times.\nFurthermore, with the aid of cookie IDs, DoubleClick can record conversions relating to ad requests.\nThis is the case, for example, when a user sees a DoubleClick advert and later visits the advertiser\u2019s website using the same browser and makes a purchase on that website.\nAccording to Google, DoubleClick cookies contain no personal information.</p>\n<p>Through the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection to the Google server.\nWe have no influence on the scope and further use of the data collected through use of this tool by Google and are therefore providing you with information

adverts.\nIf you are registered with a Google service, Google can link the visit to your account.\nEven if you are not registered with Google or are not logged in, the provider may learn and store your IP address.</p>\n<p>You can prevent participation in this tracking process in a number of ways: a) by configuring your browser software accordingly.\nin particular, the suppression of third-party cookies means that you will not receive adverts from third-party providers.\nb) by disabling the cookies for conversion tracking, by setting your browser to block cookies from the domain \"googleadservices.com\", at&nbsp;https://www.google.com/settings/ads.\nthis setting is deleted if you delete your cookies.\nc) by disabling interest-related adverts from providers who are part of the \"About Ads\" self-regulation campaign via the link&nbsp;http://www.aboutads.info/choices.\nthis setting is deleted if you delete your cookies.\nd) by permanently deactivating your Firefox, Internet Explorer or Google Chrome browser at the link&nbsp;http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin.\nPlease note that in this case, you may not be able to use fully all the functions on this

Intelligence, Inc.\n(AdDaptive) provides digital advertising services to brands, advertising agencies, and digital publishers through the use of our technology platform (Platform).\nAdDaptive's Platform, which is used on behalf of clients (Clients), manages digital advertisements across many channels, such as third-party websites, mobile apps, online video, streaming audio and streaming TV.</p>\n<p>When the AdDaptive technology is deployed on Client websites (Client Sites) and the user is located outside of the EEA, the Platform automatically receives information from the Client Site through the use of pixels tags and cookies.</p>\n<p>Additionally, publisher and advertiser clients, as well as data providers, and our Demand Side Platform partner (Xandr), provide AdDaptive with Platform Data to support advertising transactions.\nThe Platform Data may include cookies from the adnxs.com domain which you can learn more about by visiting https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/xandr/digital-platform-cookie-policy.\nThe AdDaptive Privacy Policy provides more information about Platform Data, and opting out of the use of cookies.</p> Social media plug-ins: <p>We currently use the following social media plug-ins on our website:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facebook</li>\n<li>Twitter</li>\n<li>LinkedIn</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We use the two-click solution.\nThis means that when you visit our site, no personal data is sent initially to the plug-in providers.\nYou can identify the provider of the plug-in by the marking on the box, via the provider\u2019s initial letters or logo.\nWe give you the opportunity to communicate directly with the plug-in provider via the button.\nThe plug-in provider will receive the information that you have visited the relevant page on our website only if you click on the marked field and thereby activate it.\nIn addition, the data specified in Part 1, Section 3 of this policy will be transmitted.\nIn the case of Facebook and Xing, according to these providers, the IP address is anonymised immediately after being collected in Germany.\nWhen the plug-in is activated, your personal data is therefore sent to the relevant plug-in provider and stored there (in the case of US providers, in the USA).\nBecause the plug-in providers carry out data collection using cookies, we recommend deleting all cookies via the security settings in your browser before clicking on the greyed-out box.</p>\n<p>We have no influence on the data collected or on the data processing operations, nor do we know the full scope of the data collection, the purposes of the processing or the retention periods.\nWe also have no information regarding the erasure of the collected data by the plug-in providers.</p>\n<p>The plug-in provider stores the data collected regarding you as usage profiles and uses these for advertising and market research purposes and/or for ensuring that its website is designed in accordance with requirements.\nSuch use is carried out (including for users who are not logged in) for the purposes of displaying appropriate advertising and informing other users on the social network about your activities on our website.\nYou have a right to object to the creation of these user profiles.\nTo assert this right, you must contact the relevant plug-in provider.\nVia the plug-ins, we offer you the opportunity to interact with social networks and other users so that we can improve the experience we offer and make it more interesting for you as a user.\nThe legal basis for the use of plug-ins is Art.\n6(1)(1)(f) GDPR.</p>\n<p>The data transfer takes place irrespective of whether you have an account with the plug-in provider and are logged into your account.\nIf you are logged into your account with the plug-in provider, your data collected on our website will be linked directly to this account.\nIf you click on the activated button and e.g.\nlink the page, the plug-in provider also stores this information in your user account and shares it publicly with your contacts.\nWe recommend regularly logging out after using a social network, before activating the button, as in this way you can prevent a link being made by the plug-in provider to your profile.</p>\n<p>Further information on the purpose and scope of the collection and processing of data by the plug-in provider is available in the privacy policies of these providers listed below.\nIn these privacy policies, you can also find further information on your associated rights and setting options for protecting your privacy.</p>\n<p>Addresses of the relevant plug-in providers and URLs for their privacy policies:</p>\n<p>Google Ireland Limited, Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow
