Policy\n<p>Copyright \u00a9 Vern.cc 2022, licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0 or later.</p>\n<p>This privacy policy describes how vern (\"vern.cc\", \"we\", \"us\",\n\"~vern\") collects personal information and to what degree, it also\ndescribes what rights you have regarding your privacy on vern\nservices.</p>\n<p>~vern hosts a set of publicly accessible services available for\neveryone to use, examples include the Invidious front-end, these will\nbe referred to as public services.\nThese are in contrast to private or\nmember-only services which require registration, approval from\na vern administrator, or both, to use.</p> What information do we collect on public services? <p>Vern by default does not collect any personally-identifiable\ninformation on publicly accessible services, IP addresses may or may\nnot appear on automatically-generated log files but these\nautomatically-generated log files are deleted every 48 hours.</p>\n<p>Your browser or system may or may not send additional information\nsuch as user-agents and these may or may not be present in\nautomatically-generated log files.</p>\n<p>The following information is collected in log files, this is not a\ncomplete or exhaustive list and additional information might be\ncollected:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>IP address</li>\n<p>To connect to any website, an IP address is sent by your system to\nestablish a connection, sending your IP address is unavoidable though\nyou can use proxies or virtual private networks to mask your true IP\naddress.</p>\n<li>User-agent</li>\n<p>Your browser might send this string which contains, among other\nthings, your specific operating system, your specific browser and\nspecific details such as the kernel version or layout engine used.</p>\n</ol> What information do we collect on private or member-only services? <p>Vern only collects information that you directly provide.\nMost\nservices suggest you add information about yourself but this is not\nrequired, and you can mostly leave these out.</p>\n<p>When you register with vern, the following personal information is\nrecorded:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Username</li>\n<p>Your username is used to allow you to login to vern services.</p>\n<li>Password</li>\n<p>Your password is used to allow you to login to vern services.</p>\n<li>Email</li>\n<p>Your email is used to contact you about whether or not your account\nhas been approved and it is also used to register you for services\nthat do not use usernames.\nYour email is not shared with any\nthird-parties and we take security regarding user-data very seriously.\n</p>\n<li>SSH keys</li>\n<p>In addition, your SSH public key is also stored to give you access\nto specific vern services such as the pubnix service and your SSH\npublic key might contain extra information in and of itself.</p>\n</ol>\n<p>The following information may or may not be recorded when you\naccess privacy or member-only vern services, this is not an\nexhaustive list and is not intended to be interpreted as such:</p>\n<li>Your full name</li>\n<p>Some services might ask you to provide a full name, this is not\nshared with third-parties.</p>\n<li>Email addresses</li>\n<p>Some services might ask you to provide an email address, this email\naddress might be shown publicly with an option to hide it but it is\nnot shared with any third-parties.</p>\n<li>Date of birth</li>\n<p>Some services might ask you to provide your date of birth, this in\nturn might be used to process whether or not you will be able to\naccess adult content or it might be shown publicly with an option to\nhide it.\nYour date of birth is not shared with any third-parties.</p>\n<li>Basic account info</li>\n<p>Some services might ask for a display name, biography, avatar,\nprofile picture or profile header.\nThese might be shown publicly with\nan option to hide some portions, this information is not shared with\nany third-parties</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>Messages, posts and chats.\n(Non-federated services)</li>\n<p>Some services allow you to communicate with other users, your chats\nare stored but not shared with any third-parties, these chats might\nalso be public, it depends on the service.</p>\n<li>Messages, posts and chats.\n(Federated services)</li>\n<p>Some services allow you to communicate with other users on\ndifferent servers not controlled by vern, these servers may or may not\nrecord your chats and may or may not share them with third-parties.\nRegarding this, vern cannot guarantee that your messages will be\ndeleted when requested simply because vern does not control the\nservers which your message will reach.\nAdditionally, some of your\nmessages might be \"bridged\" to other platforms in which case, it is\neven harder to get them removed, rectified or erased.</p>\n<li>IPs and other metadata</li>\n<p>Your system, browser or application may or may not send information\nin the form of IP addresses and other forms such as user-agents, this\ninformation thus in turn might be recorded on automatically-generated\nlog files, but as mentioned above, these log files are deleted every\n48 hours, in addition to being private and not shared to any\nthird-parties.</p> What do we use your personal information for? Core service functionality <p>Some services require personal information or the core\nfunctionality will not work, in some cases, you can substitute the\npersonal information for pseudonymous or false information but this is\nvery rarely the case.\nMost services on vern require some amount of\npersonal information to provide core functionality.</p> To aid in moderation, or to detect malicious activity <p>Your personal information might be collected and processed to\ncreate automatically-generated log files which might then be used to\ndetect malicious activity, or to aid in moderation of other users, or\nto detect bots that are improperly programmed.</p>\n<p>Automatically-generated log files are deleted every 48 hours,\nthough in some cases, the administrators can choose to keep some log\nfiles, such as in the case of an outage or attack on vern\ninfrastructure.</p> To be used in aggregated and anonymized statistics <p>Some services might provide a set of anonymized statistics to the\npublic in which case your information might be used but anonymized\nlater.</p> How do we protect your personal information? <p>Vern employs a variety of security measures to protect personal\ninformation from being breached by crackers or malicious actors.\nThese\nmeasures include hashing or encryption, containerization and other\nindustry-standard measures.</p> What is our data retention policy? <p>Automatically-generated log files or server logs are deleted every\n48 hours but in some cases might be kept for longer to investigate\nmalicious behavior as outlined above.</p>\n<p>Information that you provide to vern might be stored indefinitely\nor as long as vern survives, unless you personally delete it yourself\nor request vern to delete it.</p> Do we use cookies and other technologies? <p>Yes.\nSome services on vern use cookies to store your preferences or\nto see if you are logged in, these cookies do not store any\npersonally-identifiable information in most cases.</p> Is information shared to other third-parties? <p>Some vern services are federated, meaning that any messages, chats,\naccount data and the like are shared with any similar servers,\nexamples include the Matrix chatting service and Mastodon\nsocial-networking service, these services can share your messages,\nchats and other data to third-party servers which vern does not\ncontrol.\nHowever, in most cases, this information is not personal.</p>\n<p>Other vern services do not share your information with\nthird-parties.\nIt's important that we distinguish between personal\ninformation and regular information.\nNo vern service will ever share\nyour personal information with any third-parties.</p>\n<p>We care about your privacy!</p> What are my rights? Your rights under the GDPR <p>If your area has enacted the General Data Protection Regulation or\nsimilar law or regulation then you have the following rights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The right of

personal information, a user may give it to our servers without our knowledge.\nFor example, if someone types their name in an unecnrypted Matrix room, it is stored in our database.\nWe will not ban a user that is under 16 if they are not located in the EU.</li>\n<li>This rule is purely ideological, but we are committed to it.\nIt means that any original software (e.g.\non Gitea) must be free software, and other original media must grant the four essential freedoms as well.\nIt must grant the user the freedom to use/view, copy, distribute, study, and change the media <b>for any purpose</b>.\nRestrictions we will accept include preventing the user from taking away the freedom of others (e.g.\nby changing the license to a proprietary one), but these restrictions are not
