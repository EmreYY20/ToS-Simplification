information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).<br>\n<br>Circleboom sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function.\nWe use

the interests of our users.\n</p>\n<p>As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls, surveys, message boards, and forums.\nWe send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing.\nCircleboom never shares newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers, sponsors or partners.\n</p>\n<p>When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas.\nWe track search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users.\nCircleboom creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners.\nThis allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs.\nBecause we don't track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a

and keeping it private, as well as logging out of your user account, and closing your web browser when finished using the Circleboom on a shared or unsecured device.</p>OPT-OUT POLICY<p>We give users options wherever necessary and practical.\nSuch choices include: </p>\n<p>Opting not to register to receive our electronic newsletters.\n</p>\n<p>Opting not to participate in certain interactive
