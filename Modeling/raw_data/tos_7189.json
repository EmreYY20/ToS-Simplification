contract within the period specified below (generally 14 days), for any reason and without justification.\nUsers can learn more about the withdrawal conditions within this section.</p>\nWho the right of withdrawal applies to\n<p>Unless any applicable exception is mentioned below, Users who are European Consumers are granted a statutory cancellation right under EU rules, to withdraw from contracts entered into online (distance contracts) within the specified period applicable to their case, for any reason and without justification.</p>\n<p>Users that do not fit this qualification, cannot benefit from the rights described in this section.</p>\nExercising the right of withdrawal\n<p>To exercise their right of withdrawal, Users must send to the Owner an unequivocal statement of their intention to withdraw from the contract.</p>\n<p>To this end, Users may use the model withdrawal form available from within the \u201cdefinitions\u201d section of this document.\nUsers are, however, free to express their intention to withdraw from the contract by making an unequivocal statement in any other suitable way.\nIn order to meet the deadline within which they can exercise such right, Users must send the withdrawal notice before the withdrawal period expires.</p>\n<p>When does the withdrawal period expire?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Regarding the purchase of a service</strong>, the withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day that the contract is entered into, unless the User has waived the withdrawal right.</li>\n</ul> Effects of withdrawal\n<p>Users who correctly withdraw from a contract will be reimbursed by the Owner for all payments made to the Owner, including, if any, those covering the costs of delivery.</p>\n<p>However, any additional costs resulting from the choice of a particular delivery method other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by the Owner, will not be reimbursed.</p>\n<p>Such reimbursement shall be made without undue delay and, in any event, no later than 14 days from the day on which the Owner is informed of the User\u2019s decision to withdraw from the contract.\nUnless otherwise agreed with the User, reimbursements will be made using the same means of payment as used to process the initial transaction.\nIn any event, the User shall not incur any costs or fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p>\n\u2026on the purchase of services\n<p>Where a User exercises the right of withdrawal after having requested that the service be performed before the withdrawal period expires, the User shall pay to the Owner an amount which is in proportion to the part of service provided.</p>\n<p>Such payment shall be calculated based on the fee contractually agreed upon, and be proportional to the part of service provided until the time the User withdraws, compared with the full coverage of the contract.</p>\nExceptions from the right of withdrawal\n<p>The right of withdrawal does not apply to contracts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>for the supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium if the performance has begun with the consumer\u2019s prior express consent and with their acknowledgment that their right of withdrawal is thereby lost;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>for the provision of services, after the service has been fully performed if the performance has begun with the consumer\u2019s prior express consent, and with their acknowledgement that their right of withdrawal is lost once the contract has been fully performed;</li>\n</ul> GuaranteesMoney-back-guarantee\n<p>Without prejudice to any applicable statutory rights, the Owner grants Users the right to cancel a purchase they are unsatisfied with and obtain a refund.</p>\n<p>The terms and conditions applicable to such offer can be found in the dedicated section of this Website.</p> Liability and indemnificationEU UsersIndemnification\n<p>The User agrees to
