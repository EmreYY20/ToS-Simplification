Rules.\nThe arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online.\nThe arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party.\nThe arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.\nExcept where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in United States (US) \u2014 Minnesota, Minnesota.\nExcept as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in United States (US) \u2014 Minnesota, Minnesota, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.\nApplication of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Use.In no event shall any Dispute

jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>Restrictions</strong>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually.\nTo the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding.\n(b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures.\nand (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>Exceptions to Arbitration</strong>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party.\n(b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use.\nand (c) any claim for injunctive relief.\nIf this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.<p>\n</p>\n<strong>CORRECTIONS</strong>There may be<br> information on the Site that
