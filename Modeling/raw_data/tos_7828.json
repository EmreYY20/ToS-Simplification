Frankfurt,&nbsp.\nEU.\nThey are behind a number of security clearances, and there\u2019s always a security guard on duty.\nServices provided to us by IBM Cloud are in compliance with the SSAE16

confidentiality, also after departure from the company.</p>\n<p>LiveChat developers treat customer\u2019s data with the highest level of security and care.\nEach piece of customer data is treated in need of high protection.\nWe have implemented security policies which ensure safety of the data storage and transmission.</p>\n<p>LiveChat uses the following versions of Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol: 1.2 and 1.3.\nWhen accessing our software, you are communicating with LiveChat through Akamai, our Content Delivery Network provider.\nDuring this communication you negotiate through which encryption algorithm will be used, before the application protocol transmits or receives its first bytes of data.\nMost LiveChat connections are encrypted with the TLS 1.2 protocol.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to retrieve chats that you had with our support team, you can simply send us an email at support@livechat.com, asking to retrieve all the data that we gathered at LiveChat.\nWhen sending us the information retrieval request note that it should be sent from the email address that is registered under your LiveChat subscription.</p>\n<strong>Domain used by LiveChat</strong>\n<p>To make sure your firewall is not blocking any LiveChat requests, please add the following domains to your firewall\u2019s exception list.</p>\n<p>\n<em>*.livechat.com</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>*.livechat-static.com</em>\n</p>\n<p>Our CDN and anti-DDoS infrastructure is using tens of thousands edge servers, so we cannot provide a list of all IP addresses used in the process.</p>\n<p>Note that a firewall with an IP ACL policy has the additional disadvantage that access control based solely on IP addresses is prone to error due to attacks like spoofing, DNS cache poisoning, and BGP hijacking.\nWe recommend that network administrators using IP ACLs for web traffic employ a simple proxy server that filters traffic based on domain name, for example: <em>*.livechat.com</em> in the HTTP request, rather than by the IP address of the remote server.</p>\n<strong>Security of information</strong>\n<p>LiveChat is in the compliance with the following information related security and monitoring procedures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Documented and defined security procedures,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cooperation confidentiality agreement,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Access to information granted only to co-workers who need to work with customers\u2019 data or hosting servers,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Access to customer data is canceled

process.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Physical security ensured by data centers and hosting provided to and by LiveChat meets the following requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Secure rooms with at least two access mechanisms, i.e., key-cards, man traps, security guards, and computer room badge-in,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Authorized co-workers only are allowed physical access to the servers.\n24/7 security at the location,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Backups of customer data are stored on-site with limited access and at a securely controlled or commercial off-site location,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The site guarantees additional protection such as uninterruptible power and fire suppression,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Flawed components in the data center undergo DoD-approved \u201cerase\u201d or \u201cwipe\u201d procedure (if functionally possible) prior to physical destruction.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Technical controls</strong>\n<p>LiveChat supports technical controls to provide protection to its network, systems, and applications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>LiveChat utilizes professional facilities via a top tier hosting provider that protect customer data from external threats,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>LiveChat maintains individual accountability for co-workers that can access systems hosting customer data,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>LiveChat has documented user account/password management systems for co-workers with access to systems that are hosting customer data</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>LiveChat ensures that individual access to customer data is controlled, i.e., a diverse username and password is required for each individual administrator,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Customer data is compartmentalized to prevent unauthorized access and separated from the data

long,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The application and resulting access to data in the database has based-on-permission controls limiting access to only authorized customers,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Each change of user login status is logged within each application</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All logs are treated as confidential information and access to reports can be restricted using the permission system,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reporting of this information is available within each instance of LiveChat,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If confidential data, personal data (i.e., names, addresses, phone
