the data strictly necessary for the invoicing of batches of licenses.</p> 2.1.\nHow Do We collect Your Data? <p>We collect information about You only:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>when You purchase license packages (as a representative of the entity for which You work),</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>when You contact Us or interact with Us by any other means (e-mail, telephone, social networks\u2026),</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>when You respond to one of Our satisfaction surveys,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>when You subscribe to Our marketing communications.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> 2.2.\nWhy Do We Collect Your Data? <p>Olvid only collects data that is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed.</p>\n<p>The legal basis on which we collect data is the performance of the contract that binds Us with You when You use Our services or with Your consent.</p>\n<p>These purposes are specific and legitimate and, under no circumstances will Your data be further processed in a manner incompatible with these purposes, except with Your prior consent.</p>\n<p>Thus, We are likely to use Your data, as the case may be, for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>invoice the user licenses,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>respond to Your contact requests,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>manage possible complaints.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> 2.3 What data do we collect? <p>By <strong>Personal Data</strong>, we mean any information allowing us to identify you, directly or indirectly by reference, as the case may be: (i) to an identification number.\n(ii) to one or more elements specific to you.\n(iii) or by cross-referencing information.\nWe distinguish between personal data of users and purely technical data on access to the service (IP addresses) and billing.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>For the direct sale of license packages:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>As part of the sale of license packages, the information that We may collect and process is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Your first and last names</strong>*</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Your company\u2019s name</strong>*</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Your contact information (phone and postal address)</strong>*</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Your email</strong>*</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Your bank and financial data</strong>* to proceed to the billing</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Your contact history</strong> with Us to provide you with assistance</li>\n<li>\n<strong>The IP address</strong> for the use of the application.\nWe remind you that, like any application, Olvid uses for its operation the IP addresses of the users, without ever consulting, collecting or keeping them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>mandatory fields</strong> are those indicated as such by the <strong>symbol (*)</strong>.\nIf You do not fill in these fields, We will unfortunately not be able to access your request.\nThe other data are optional, i.e.\nYou are free to fill them in, or not, without any particular obligation or inconvenience to You.</p> 3.\nSharing Your Data <p>With whom do We share Your data? The only people authorized to access Your data are the Olvid team members.</p>\n<p>Our service providers may also receive personal data that is strictly necessary for the performance of the services entrusted to them and in particular those We call upon to perform the services.\nWe use AWS servers, specifying again that servers do not play any role in security, only IP addresses can be visible by the provider.</p>\n<p>We are also likely to communicate Your data in order to respond to legal or regulatory requests, court decisions, subpoenas or legal proceedings, if compliance with the regulations in force requires it, as well as in the event that Olvid transfers all or part of its assets to a third party company.</p> 4.\nRetention period <p>How long is your data kept? Your billing data will be kept by Olvid for the period of time that you use Our services, and deleted no later than three years from the last contact, unless anonymized or legally required by law to keep certain data for a longer period of time.</p>\n<p>We would like to remind you that purely technical data, i.e.\nIP addresses, are not stored.</p> 5.\nSecurity conditions <p>The protection of Your privacy and Your data is a priority.\nWithin Olvid, We take adequate security measures, in particular technical and organizational measures, to protect Your data against accidental loss, destruction, misuse, damage and unauthorized or illegal access.</p>\n<p>All personal data is confidential and access to it is therefore limited to Olvid employees.</p>\n<p>All persons having access to Your data are bound by a duty of confidentiality and are subject to disciplinary measures and/or other sanctions if they fail to comply with these obligations.</p>\n<p>Transactions with a third party recipient are subject to a contract in order to assure You of the protection of Your personal data and the respect of Your rights.</p> 6.\nExercising Your Rights <p>What are Your rights and how to exercise them?
