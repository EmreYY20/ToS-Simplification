award.\nYou and CTemplar also agree that any claims or disputes cannot be brought as a class action.\nPlease carefully review the dispute resolution section below.\nIf you do not accept the arbitration provision then you may not use the site.</p>\n<strong>2.\nCTEMPLAR\u2019S RIGHT TO MODIFY TERMS</strong>\n<p>CTemplar may modify any of the Terms at any time by posting them on the

@ctemplar.com email address to the User\u2019s email address on file with CTemplar or via other means including but not limited to a pop-up or banner, message or other conspicuous notice on the

all emails from CTemplar\u2019s email addresses.\nYour use of the Service post-notification will signify your acceptance of the changes.\nIf you do not accept the changes, your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using the Site.\nThe latest Terms will be posted on the Site, and you should always review them prior to using the Site.</p>\n<strong>3.&nbsp;MEMBERSHIP AND
