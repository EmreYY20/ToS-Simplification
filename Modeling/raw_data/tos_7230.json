(except as provided below in the Exception provision) subject to the terms set forth below.\nSpecifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including the Terms\u2019 formation, performance, and breach), the parties' relationship with each other, and/or use of the Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules for claims that do not exceed $250,000 and the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims exceeding $250,000 in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.\n</p>\n<p>Filing a Demand.\nTo start an arbitration, you must do the following: (a) Write a Demand for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the amount of damages you seek to recover (you may find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration and more information about JAMS and the JAMS rules at www.jamsadr.com).\n(b) Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS (contact information for JAMS, as well as copies of the JAMS rules and applicable forms, are available at www.jamsadr.com).\nand (c) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to us at: legal@gopro.com </p>\n<p>When you initiate arbitration against us, you are required to pay up to $250 of the filing fee to initiate the arbitration.\nTo the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds that amount, GoPro will pay the additional cost.\nIf the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, GoPro will pay the fees invoiced by JAMS, including filing fees and arbitrator and hearing expenses.\nYou are responsible for your own attorneys' fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.\n</p>\n<p>GoPro and you understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, GoPro and you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.\nGoPro and you further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.\n</p>\n<p>Arbitrator\u2019s Powers.\nThe arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct.\nThe arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.\nThe decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding and conclusive on GoPro and you, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.\nGoPro and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation, motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment will be allowed in the arbitration.\nThe arbitrator must follow these Terms and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief and attorney's fees.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, GoPro and you agree not to seek any attorney's fees and expert witness costs unless the arbitrator finds that a claim or defense was frivolous or asserted for an improper purpose.\n</p>\n<p>Location of Arbitration.\nIf you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing, unless you and we both agree to another location or telephonic arbitration.\nFor residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the courts of the Northern District of California, and GoPro and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of the Northern District of California to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\nIf your claim is solely for monetary relief of $10,000 or less, and does not include a request for any type of equitable remedy, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the JAMS Rules.\n</p>\n<p>Exception: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims.\nNotwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations, or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court with jurisdiction or in the U.S.\nPatent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights (\"intellectual property rights\" means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights).\nEither party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.\nYou and we agree that to the extent that either party has a good faith belief that a dispute falls within the jurisdiction of the small claims court in the U.S.\ncounty (or parish) of your residence, or of a small claims court with jurisdiction and venue over GoPro, either party may elect to have such dispute adjudicated in such small claims court.\nSuch election can be made by either party even after the other party initiates an arbitration.\nIn such case, the party that initiated the arbitration agrees to dismiss or suspend the arbitration and seek to resolve the dispute in small claims court.\nYou and we agree that in the situation where an arbitration is already initiated and one party invokes the small claims court option, any dispute regarding whether the dispute is properly within the jurisdiction of a small claims court shall be resolved by the small claims court in the first instance (unless it is unwilling to do so) and not the arbitrator or JAMS.\n</p>\n<p>Class Action Waiver.\nGoPro and you agree that GoPro and you will resolve any disputes, claims or controversies on an individual basis, and that any claims brought under these Terms in connection with the Service will be brought in an individual capacity, and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding.\nGoPro and you further agree that GoPro and you shall not participate in any consolidated, class, or representative proceeding (existing or future) brought by any third party arising under these Terms or in connection with the Service.\nIf any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the disputes, claims or controversies will not be subject to arbitration and must be litigated in federal court located in the Northern District of California.\n</p>\n<p>30-Day Right to Opt Out.\nYou have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt out by emailing us at legal@gopro.com with the subject line, \"ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT.\u201d The notice must be sent within the later of 30 days of your first use of the Service or within 30 days of the date any changes to these arbitration provisions became effective, as indicated in the \u201cLast Updated Date to Section 20\u201d above or in the date of GoPro\u2019s email to you notifying you of such change.\nOtherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate any disputes, claims, or controversies in accordance with the terms of this Section.\nIf you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, GoPro also will not be bound by them.\nIf you do not affirmatively elect to opt out as described above, your use of the Service will be deemed to be your irrevocable acceptance of these Terms and any changes/updates to this section.\n</p>\n<p>Changes to This Section.\nGoPro will provide thirty (30) days' notice of any changes to this section by posting on the Services.\nAmendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on the Services or sent to you by email.\nChanges to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day.\nIf a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on \"Changes to This Section\" is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the section entitled Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver, and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began using the Services.\n</p>\n<p>General.\nIf any clause within these arbitration provisions is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from these arbitration provisions, and the remainder of the arbitration provisions will be given full force and effect.\nIn the event some or all of these arbitration provisions are determined to be unenforceable for any reason, or if a claim, dispute or controversy is brought that is found by a court to be excluded from the scope of these arbitration provisions, GoPro and you agree to waive, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial by jury.\nThis section shall survive any termination of your use of the Services.\nThe terms of this section will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any present or future parent or affiliated company of GoPro to the extent that any such claims arise out of your access to, and/or use of the Service, and/or the provision of content, services, and/or technology on or through the Service and will be binding on you, your heirs, successors, and assigns.</p>\n<br>21.\nExport Control and Economic Sanctions Laws<p>You agree to comply fully with all U.S.\nand foreign export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations that apply to the Services, including restrictions on any use of the Service where data is exported or re-exported directly or indirectly in violation of, or used for any purposes prohibited by, such laws and regulations.\nBy using the Service, you represent and warrant that: (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S.\nGovernment export embargo, or that has been sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S.\nGovernment list of prohibited or restricted parties.</p>\n<br>22.\nGovernment End Users<p>The Service is a \u201ccommercial item\u201d as that term is defined in FAR 2.101, consisting of \u201ccommercial computer software\u201d and \u201ccommercial computer software documentation,\u201d respectively, as such terms are used in FAR 12.212 and DFARS 227.7202.\nIf the Service is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S.\nGovernment, then, as provided in FAR 12.212 and DFARS 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, as applicable, the U.S.\nGovernment\u2019s rights in the Service will be only those specified in this Agreement.</p>\n<br>23.\nText Message Program<p>GoPro\u2019s SMS Terms and Conditions govern the provision and delivery of text messages by GoPro and our text message service providers.</p>\n<br>24.\nGeneral<p>The failure of GoPro to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision.\nThe waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of GoPro.\nExcept as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.\nIf for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.\nTo access the Terms of Service for your territory please change the country setting on the Site by clicking the country link in the top right corner of the pages.\nIf specific terms are not available, we will default to
