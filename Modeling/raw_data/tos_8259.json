moderators.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not-safe-for-work content or links may be removed at moderator discretion, based on judgment calls as to whether the material is offensive or poses other risks to the Zcash Community Forum and its users.\nNSFW content includes, but is not limited to, sexually explicit material and graphic depictions of violence or gore.</p>\n<p>With respect to sexual content in particular, users may <strong>not</strong> post sexually explicit material, either in images or text.\nLinks to NSFW content that are relevant to Zcash (for example, a service accepting Zcash payments) must include a warning for other users, must not include explicit material in the link preview, and must not be spam.</p>\n<p>Moderation decisions about NSFW content will be made individually, then reviewed by the rest of the moderators, and warnings will be issued if relevant.\nA pattern of conduct violating this rule may result in a permanent ban.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Moderation <p>Forum moderators have the right and responsibility to hide, edit, or reject posts, comments and other contributions that are not aligned with these Community Guidelines.\nThe process is described in a post by @Shawn.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Moderators will post publicly the rational of non-personal administrative actions (such as removing or moving posts) and will closely follow the Moderation Policy\n</li>\n<li>Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members.\nIf a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Moderators shall:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Acknowledge that they are acting in an official capacity as a forum moderator and will uphold the Zcash Foundation Values</li>\n<li>Foster a community that encourages the bigger picture of Zcash aka: building a censorship resistant system where people can safely transact.</li>\n<li>Maintain a welcoming community by taking necessary action towards all community members\u2013including moderators\u2013who choose not to follow these standards.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that several moderators are community volunteers and do not represent the Zcash Foundation.\nThey are free to express their own opinions so long as they adhere to these guidelines.\nFoundation representatives are identified with the title \u201cZcash Foundation\u201d.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>By adopting these Community Guidelines, moderators commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing this community.\nModerators who do not follow or enforce the Community Guidelines may be permanently removed from the moderation team.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p> Reporting <p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by flagging the post or comment in question, contacting an individual moderator (such as @decentralistdan) or by messaging the moderators as a group (@moderators).</p>\n<p>All complaints will be reviewed, investigated, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate for the circumstances.\n<strong>Moderators are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you do not feel comfortable messaging @moderators or an individual moderator, please email contact@zfnd.org.</p>\n<p>\n<em>The guidelines above are based on the Zcash core contributor code of conduct, which is based on version 1.3.0 of the Contributor Covenant.\nThe language has been modified to suit a forum environment.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p> Etiquette <p>Please do not:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Post topics unrelated to Zcash.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Solicit domain sales (even if related to Zcash).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bump topics without something new to add.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Derail topics.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Post links to phishing sites.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Post spam.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Create topics or replies for the sole purpose of causing unrest on the forum.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Repost closed or deleted topics.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Repetitively post in the incorrect topic.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Create and use multiple accounts as sockpuppets.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Post solicitations for or about services considered illegal in the United States.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Post links to internet gambling operations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It\u2019s a crime for internet gambling operations to accept bets from United States persons, and the Justice Department takes the position that people who post advertisements or promotions for online gambling may be aiding and abetting those activities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Post political content that would be viewed as endorsing or campaigning for any political candidate.\nThe Zcash Foundation is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization and as such are \u201cabsolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office\u201d</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And remember to keep in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the Zcash community we strive to go the extra step to look out for each other.\nDon\u2019t just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best self.\nIn particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if they\u2019re off-topic.\nthis all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust.\nworse, it can drive people away from the community entirely.\n<strong>We expect that members will work towards collaboration, not conflict</strong>.</li>\n<li>New people don\u2019t always know where to find information, so try to be as helpful as you can.</li>\n<li>Mods will use a yellow color to show when they act in that role within a discussion.</li>\n<li>Respect the privacy of PM (private message) conversations and the wishes of everyone involved.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p> Copyright <p>You may not post anything digital that belongs to someone else without permission.\nYou may not post descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing someone\u2019s intellectual property (software, video, audio, images), or for breaking any other law.\nSee the Terms of Service for more details on this
