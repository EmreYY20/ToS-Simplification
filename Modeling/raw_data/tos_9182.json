Arbitration.\nPlease read this Section carefully.\nYOU AND TAIMI, AND EACH OF OUR RESPECTIVE AGENTS, CORPORATE PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, AGREE TO ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AS THE EXCLUSIVE FORM OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR BELOW, FOR ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICE, UNLESS YOU ARE LOCATED IN A JURISDICTION THAT PROHIBITS THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF ARBITRATION FOR DISPUTE RESOLUTION.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\nPlease visit www.adr.org for more information about arbitration.</p>\n<p>Commencing Arbitration.\nA party intending to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by an international courier with a tracking mechanism, a written notice of intent to arbitrate (a \"Notice\"), or, in the absence of a mailing address provided by you to Taimi, via any other method available to Taimi, including via e-mail.\nThe Notice to Taimi must be addressed to Social Impact Inc.\n(1180 North Town Center Drive 100, Las Vegas, Nevada, 89144.\nfile number: 6675809), Attn: Chief Executive Officer (the \"Arbitration Notice Address\").\nThe Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (the \"Demand\").\nIf you and Taimi do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, then you or Taimi may commence an arbitration proceeding as set forth below or file a claim in small claims court.\nTHE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (\"AAA\") WILL ADMINISTER THE ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES (THE \"Rules\"), AS MODIFIED BY THIS AGREEMENT.\nThe Rules and AAA forms are available online at http://www.adr.org.\nIf you are required to pay a filing fee to commence an arbitration against Taimi, then Taimi will promptly reimburse you for your confirmed payment of the filing fee upon Taimi's receipt of a Notice at the Arbitration Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration along with a receipt evidencing payment of the filing fee, unless your Demand is equal to or greater than $1,000 or was filed in bad faith, in which case you are solely responsible for the payment of the filing fee.</p>\n<p>Arbitration Proceeding.\nThe arbitration will be in English.\nA single independent and impartial arbitrator with their primary place of business in San Francisco, California will be appointed pursuant to the Rules, as modified herein.\nYou and Taimi agree to comply with the following rules, which are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the costs and burdens on the parties: (i) the arbitration will be conducted online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.\n(ii) the arbitration will not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties.\nand (iii) any judgment on the award the arbitrator renders may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>No Class Actions.\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER LAW, YOU AND TAIMI AGREE THAT YOU AND TAIMI MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nFURTHER, YOU AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND THAT IF THIS SPECIFIC PROVISO IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION SECTION WILL BE NULL AND VOID.</p>\n<p>Decision of the Arbitrator.\nBarring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator will issue their decision within 120 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed.\nThe arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days in the interests of justice.\nAll arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and confidential, and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award.\nThe award of the arbitrator will be in writing and will include a statement setting forth the reasons for the disposition of any claim.\nThe arbitrator will apply the laws of the State of California in conducting the arbitration.\nYou acknowledge that these terms and your use of the Service evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce.\nThe United States Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to this Section 16.</p>\n<p>Equitable Relief.\nThe foregoing provisions of this Section 16 do not apply to any claim in which either party seeks equitable relief to protect such party's copyrights, trademarks, or patents.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, however, you acknowledge that, in the event Taimi or a third party breaches this Agreement, the damage or harm, if any, caused to you will not entitle you to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against Taimi, and your only remedy will be for monetary damages, subject to the limitations of liability set forth in this Agreement.</p>\n<p>Claims.\nYou and Taimi agree that, notwithstanding any other rights a party may have under law or equity, any cause of action arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Service, excluding a claim for indemnification, must commence within one year after the cause of action accrues.\nOtherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.</p>\n<p>Improperly Filed Claims.\nAll claims you bring against Taimi must be resolved in accordance with this Section.\nAll claims filed or brought contrary to this Section will be considered improperly filed.\nShould you file a claim contrary to this Section, Taimi may recover attorneys' fees and reimbursement of its costs, provided that Taimi has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.</p>\n<p>Modifications.\nIn the event that Taimi makes any future change to the \"Mandatory Arbitration\" paragraph set forth above (other than a change to Taimi's Arbitration Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to Taimi's Arbitration Notice Address, in which case your account with Taimi and your license to use the Service will terminate immediately, and this Section, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, will survive the termination of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>Enforceability.\nIf only the \"No Class Actions\" paragraph above or the entirety of this Section 16 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 16 will be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 17 or Section 17-1 will govern any action arising out of or related to this Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>17.\nGOVERNING LAW</p>\n<p>The laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of law rules, govern this Agreement and your use of the Service.\nYour use of the Service may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.\nTo the extent that any action relating to any dispute hereunder is permitted to be brought in a court of law, such action will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California, and you hereby irrevocably submit to personal jurisdiction in such courts, and waive any defense of inconvenient forum.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>17-1.\nGOVERNING LAW FOR EU RESIDENTS</p>\n<p>If you are a resident of the European Union and European Economic Area, the agreement to arbitrate in Section 16 will not apply to you.\nThe laws of Cyprus, excluding its conflicts of law principles, govern the terms of this Agreement and your use of the Service.\nUnless otherwise required by a mandatory law of a member state of the European Union, the sole and exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any action or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement and your use of Service shall be in the appropriate courts located in Limassol, Cyprus.\nYou hereby irrevocably submit to personal jurisdiction in such courts and waive any defense of inconvenient forum.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>18.\nINDEMNITY</p>\n<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold Taimi, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and each of their directors, officers, managers, agents, contractors, partners and employees harmless from any loss, liability, claim, damages, costs, debts, expenses or demand, including reasonable attorney's fees, due to or arising from (i) your use of or access to the Service, including any data or content transmitted or received by you, or your

Policy (the \u201cPolicy\u201d) explains all the privacy matters you may face when using our website, https://taimi.com<u>&nbsp;</u>and other websites run by Taimi (the \u201cWebsite\u201d) and Taimi\u2019s mobile (the \u201cApp\u201d), jointly the \u201cService\u201d, operated by Social Impact Inc.\n(\u201cTaimi\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This Policy is an integral part of the Taimi\u2019s Terms of Service (the \u201cTerms\u201d) and incorporated by reference into them.\nPlease read this Policy carefully and if you have any questions, feel free to contact us at legal@taimi.com.\nIn case you have any ongoing questions about how to exercise your rights, etc., you may also contact us at support@taimi.com.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some services which may be employed by either Taimi or you to interact with the Services may have their own privacy rules (third-party privacy policies).\nThus, if your personal data is processed by such services, such processing is governed by third-party privacy policies, not this present Policy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By using the Service, you agree that the collection and processing of your data will be covered by the terms of this Policy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>Initial Notice to Users</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.1.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Here, at Taimi, we strive to protect your privacy.\nIt goes without saying, by being a place for building the best connections between people, that the App exists as a vast social network, where users may share their experiences, show emotions and just be themselves.\nAll of those actions are connected to personal data sharing.\nYour \u201cpersonal data\u201d or just \u201cdata\u201d means any information linked with you or the one that may identify you directly or indirectly as a person.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.2.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>Privacy tips</strong>.\nDespite our best efforts, we cannot control how other users or third-party services may use your data.\nWhen using Taimi, you should presume that everything you post, share or message on the App may be publicly viewable and accessible, both by Taimi users and people outside the App.\nWe want you to be careful about going public with your data, thus, we kindly ask you to follow our privacy recommendations as below:</p>\n<p>(a) &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;when you post information about yourself or use the messaging function, the amount of personal information you share is determined at your own risk.</p>\n<p>(b) &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nyou share information with other users when you voluntarily disclose information on the Service (including your Taimi profile).\nThat is why we recommend and encourage you to think carefully about the information you disclose about yourself.\nPlease be careful with your data and make sure that the information you publish is data you feel comfortable being publicly viewable;</p>\n<p>(c) &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;we do <strong>not</strong> recommend that you put email addresses, URLs, instant messaging details, phone numbers, full names or addresses, credit card details, national identity numbers, drivers\u2019 licence details and other important data on your Taimi profile or send that data via direct messages to people that you do not trust;</p>\n<p>(d) &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nwe do <strong>not</strong> recommend that you share your sensitive data (religious denomination, sexual preferences, health details, political leanings, any kind of addictions, etc.) with other users.\nIf you really desire to share this data safely (so as to set up more relevant connections, etc.), you may use Taimi tags features.\nWith this regard to Taimi tags, please read section 1.3 hereof to find out the benefits of their use;</p>\n<p>(e) &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;photos that you share via Taimi may reveal much information about you.\nplease inspect all of them for data or objects that you do not want to go public with before you upload or share your photos;</p>\n<p>(f) &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nplease make sure you log out of your Taimi profile after use from either your or a third-party\u2019s device since you never know who may get access to them;</p>\n<p>(g) &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;please do not share your access credentials (login, email, password, phone number, etc.) to Taimi or other social media profiles with anyone else;</p>\n<p>(h) &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nwe recommend that you change your Taimi and other social media password from time to time;</p>\n<p>(i) &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nif you think or even have the slightest suspicion that someone may have had access to your Taimi or social media profile or access credentials, first of all, change them immediately.\nif you lost your access to the profile owing to third-party activity, we recommend that you contact us at support@taimi.com (if there is no access to Taimi profile) or report the issue to the relevant social media platform;</p>\n<p>(j) &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nwe kindly draw your attention to the fact that you are the only person who must care about your access credentials\u2019 safety.\nRemember that in the event they are compromised, a third party may get your data.\nWe cannot guarantee your data security if you lose control of your account and do not notify Taimi about the issue.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.3.\n&nbsp;Taimi tags.</strong> Instead of sharing some of your data in a text description of your profile, we recommend that you use Taimi &nbsp;tags to identify you as a person of a specific style.\nWe find it a more secure and beneficial option since you may change them or hide them anytime you choose.\nMeanwhile, Taimi tags allow you to create better connections with people who may share your views and are more likely to say \u201chello\u201d.\nYou may also choose to add information about yourself that may be categorized as sensitive data under your local data privacy laws, e.g., when you add certain Taimi tags to your profile, such as data concerning a natural person\u2019s sex life and sexual orientation.\nFrom time to time, we may ask for your explicit consent to process such sensitive information and making this public to other users.\nIf you do not give your explicit consent to process such sensitive data, we will not be able to connect you with other users.\nStill, all any time, you are entitled to make us stop showing that data to others by deleting relevant tags in your profile settings, restricting some users from accessing your profile (in this case just blocked users will not see your data) or requesting that we delete your tags or other data at support@taimi.com.\nFor the users who are California residents, you may find the categories of sensitive personal information that may be publicly viewable and accessible both by users and non-users of the App in section 9.2.\nhereof.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>Changes and Updates to Policy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.1.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>Reasons of

consumer, we will have 45 calendar days following the date of your request to process your request.\nIn the event of your failure to pass the verification process within 45 calendar days, we may deny your request or prolong the term of processing up to additional 45 calendar days.\nplease be sure that we will notify you about our decision;</p>\n<p>(c) &nbsp.\n&nbsp;if you are an EU or UK user, we will have 30 calendar days following the date that you provide us with the data required for verification to process your request.\nIn the event of your failure to pass the verification process, we may deny your request.\nWe are entitled to prolong the response term up to 2 months by giving you a notification.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.3.&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>Verification and automated decision-making</strong>.&nbsp;The most important step is the verification process.\nWe will first check that we have enough information to be sure of your identity.\nOften, we will have no reason to doubt a person\u2019s identity (if you contact us via the App, for example).\nWe use a combination of the automated system and&nbsp;a team of moderators&nbsp;to verify the users` identity and users are not robots.&nbsp;And we also want to avoid fake Taimi accounts being created which can be used for malicious activities and cybercrime \u2013 they threaten the Taimi network and spoil things for everyone.&nbsp;If you choose to verify your profile photo, our automated system will scan each photo that you submit.&nbsp;So, automated decision-making is necessary in order to&nbsp;help ensure that you are who you say you are&nbsp;before entering into a contract with you.&nbsp;This ultimately assists our efforts to prevent and respond to illegal, malicious, and unauthorized activity.&nbsp;We do not add the verification photos to your profile.</p>\n<p>If we have good grounds to doubt your identity, we may ask you to provide additional evidence we reasonably need to confirm your identity.\nFor example, we may ask you for a piece of information held in your profile that we would expect you to know: your location, last 5 connections, etc.\nIf we have serious doubts about your identity, we may ask you to share with Taimi your photo with your ID document or an image of your ID document.\nIn the event you fail the verification process, your request will be rejected.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.4.&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>Authorized Agent</strong>.\nYou, as a California consumer, may assign your agent to submit a request on your behalf.\nIf you desire to use this way, your agent shall provide us with your written authorization.\nOwing to a sensitive nature of your data, we reserve the right to reject, at any time, requests concerning your data submitted by any third party.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>Third-Party Websites</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.1.&nbsp;</strong>The Services may

Services.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.3.&nbsp;</strong>We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices to update our physical, technical and organizational security measures.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.4.&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM

integral part of the Taimi\u2019s Terms of Service (the \u201cTerms\u201d) and Privacy Policy (the \u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d).\nAll the terms used herein shall have the same meaning as the Terms and Privacy Policy provide, unless otherwise indicated hereby.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p> 1.\nChanges and Updates to Policy <p>1.1.\nAll changes to this Policy shall be made and published as outlined in paragraph 2 of the Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p> 2.\nWhy Taimi Needs Tracking Technologies <p>2.1.\nLike many companies, we use cookies (as defined in subparagraph 3.1.\nof the Policy) and other tracking technologies on the Website or on the Taimi mobile application (jointly, \u201ccookies\u201d unless otherwise stated) including web beacons/GIFs as defined below.</p>\n<p>2.2.\nWe use cookies and other tracking technologies- particularly to improve user experience and obtain data about how the Website is being used.\nThe details of the cookies and tracking technologies used are specified below.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2.3.\nThe drop or the reading of certain cookies does not require your prior consent, either because they do not process any of your personal data, or because they are strictly necessary for the supply of the Services.\nYou can decide whether or not to allow the drop of cookies which are not strictly necessary to operate the computer.\nIf you agree (consent), these cookies will be stored to allow you to access third party hosted content on the website or on the mobile application.\nYou may, at any time, object to the storage or the reading of the cookies we use, either by deleting them from your devices or by changing your browser settings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p> 3.\nTracking Technologies <p>3.1.\nCookies are small pieces of code that are stored in your device (computer, digital tablet, smartphone) when you browse and use online services.\nThey are installed on your device to enable different useful features, for example, to facilitate navigation on the Website.\nAfter installed on your device, cookies may be either deleted automatically, when you close the Website/web browser (session cookies), or stored in your device to facilitate future visits to the Website or to the mobile application (persistent cookies).\nPersistent cookies are automatically deleted after a period of time set by the cookies\u2019 owner.</p>\n<p>3.2.\nWeb beacons are small graphic images or other web programming code (also known as \u201c1\u00d71 GIFs\u201d or \u201cclear GIFs\u201d) that may be included in the Website\u2019s and mobile application\u2019s pages and our messages.\nWeb beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or email can act as a web beacon.\nClear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar, in function, to cookies.\nIn contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user\u2019s computer hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.</p>\n<p>3.3.\nIn some cases, cookies are used to collect data that is recognized as personal data, such as, but not limited to, IP addresses and data linked to the IP address.\nThe usage of such cookies is regulated by the data protection laws and you, as a user, obtain a number of rights to control the collection and processing of this data.</p>\n<p>3.4.\nWhile providing you with our services, we may use the following cookies: a) essential or strictly necessary cookies.\nb) performance cookies.\nc) analytical cookies.\nd) targeting/advertising cookies.\nThese cookies may be session or persistent.</p>\n<p>3.5.\nSession cookies are only stored temporarily in the browser\u2019s memory and are destroyed once you quit the browser.\nHowever, they will survive navigating away from the Website they came from.\nIf no expiration date is set, they are automatically considered as session cookies.\n&nbsp;Persistent cookies are saved on your computer, so when you shut it down and start it up again, they can still be there.\nthey are created by giving them an expiry date and once that expiry date is reached, they will be automatically destroyed by the computer itself.\nIf an expiry date is not set, they are automatically session cookies.</p>\n<p>3.6.\n\u201cEssential\u201d or \u201cStrictly Necessary\" cookies are strongly required for an error-free operation of the website and of the Taimi mobile application, as well as for its security and accessibility.\nWe also need them to remember your preference about cookies.\nWithout them, we will not be able to provide you with the Services in a proper way.\nAlthough you cannot refuse these cookies through the Website or the mobile application, you may disable them by changing your browser settings, but this may affect the Website\u2019s or the mobile application\u2019s functionality.\nThese cookies are mostly session and expire on quitting the browser.</p>\n<p>3.7.\n\u201cPerformance\u201d cookies collect information about how you use the Website, for instance which pages you go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages.\nThese cookies don\u2019t collect information that identifies you.\nAll information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore, anonymous.\nIt is only used to improve how the website and the Taimi mobile application\u2019s works.\nGenerally, these cookies are a mix of session and persistent cookies.</p>\n<p>3.8.\n\u201cAnalytical\u201d cookies allow us to track your activity on the Website or on the mobile application.\nWe may track the number of sessions, measure duration, characteristics of your device, pages you visit, etc.\nWe do so to optimize the Website and the Taimi mobile application and make it more interesting and useful for you.\nThe data collected in such a way is stored in aggregated form.\nGenerally, these cookies are a mix of session and persistent cookies.</p>\n<p>3.9.\n\u201cTargeting/Advertising\u201d cookies allow us to show you our advertisements on third-party websites.\nThis tool is called \u201cretargeting\u201d.\nIt enables us to provide you with ads based on your previous activity on the Website.\nIt also enables us to limit how many times you see the respective ads.\nGenerally, these cookies are persistent cookies.</p>\n<p>3.10.\nWe may use the following
