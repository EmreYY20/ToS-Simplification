Search: <strong>Return Policy</strong>\n<p>At Bob's Watches, it is our goal to ensure that every customer is 100% satisfied with their purchase.\nTo that end, we offer a \"no questions asked\" 3 day refund on all purchases subject to the following conditions.\nProducts that have been worn, altered or damaged will not be accepted for a full refund.\nAny pre-owned watch may be returned provided the watch is in the exact same condition as it was sold and includes all the boxes, papers, books and accessories.\nPlease inform one of our representatives of your intention to return the watch before you ship the merchandise.\nAll return shipments must be post marked before the 3rd calendar day from receipt of your watch and are sent at your sole cost and expense.\nPlease be sure to insure the contents for their full value as we are not responsible for lost packages.\nUpon receipt, all items will undergo a thorough inspection by one of our watch experts to ensure that the watch is in the original condition in which it was sold and it includes all tags (especially any \"non-removable\" tags), items/accessories, etc before we will issue a refund.\nUpon completion of the inspection we will refund the purchase price less any return shipping and insurance fees paid by Bob's Watches and any transaction fees (i.e.\ncredit card, Amazon, financing or PayPal fees).&nbsp.\nThis return policy is for on-line sales only: all in-store sales and International sales are final.</p>\nRolex Factory Stickered Watches\n<p>These items are being sold in unused/unworn condition and come with the original Rolex factory stickers.\nRemoving these factory stickers will significantly impact the value and resalability of this watch.\nTherefore, these stickers must not be removed in-order-to be eligible for a full refund.\nAny watches returned with these factory stickers removed will be addressed on a case-by-case basis, but could decrease the refund by as much as 20% of the purchase price.</p>\nHoliday Policy\n<p>During the holiday season Bob's is offering an extended return policy for exchange only.\nThere are no cash refunds for this extended period.\nAny watch purchased between Black Friday and December 25th may be exchanged for any item through December 31st.\nWe must receive the returned item by December 31.\nMerchandise purchased after December 25th, or merchandise that is returned within 3 days of receipt, falls under Bob's standard non-holiday return policy.</p>\nNeed More Time for Holiday Purchases?\n<p>No problem.\nJust give us a call so we can
