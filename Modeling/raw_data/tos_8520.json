website in order to provide statistics and aggregated reports regarding the reach and demographic composition and audience profile of a website or an app.</p>\n<p>Moreover, for the purpose of the Reppublika Campaign Control module, either through a cookie which is placed by the third-party online research panel provider on its members upon their prior explicit consent, or&nbsp.\nthrough ID

desktop, app) is being tracked in order to develop audience insights in connection with marketing campaigns.&nbsp.\nMembers of the third-party partner online panel provider who have seen, clicked on

accessed, as well as information about the content that was viewed (e.g., which ad campaign), where the content was viewed (e.g., on which website or in which app).\nIt uses such data in order to calculate the traffic and reach of a service, the unique users, the visits and the page impressions.\nReppublika only receives information in form of aggregated or pseudonymous audience statistics and
