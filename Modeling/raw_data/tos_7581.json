AS A COURT (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For any Dispute, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve your claim by sending a written description of your claim to Whataburger, Inc., ATTN: Legal Department, 300 Concord Plaza Drive, San Antonio TX 78216.\nYou and we each agree to negotiate your claim in good faith for a sixty-day period.\nYou further agree that you may not commence any arbitration or court proceeding unless you and we are unable to resolve the claim within 60 days after we receive your claim description and you have made a good faith effort to resolve your claim directly with us during that time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<u>WAIVER OF CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED ACTIONS (\u201cCLASS ACTION WAIVER\u201d)</u>.\nYOU AND WE EACH AGREE THAT YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY ON YOUR OWN BEHALF, AND NOT IN ANY REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR ON BEHALF OF ANY CLASS OR PURPORTED CLASS, AND NO PROCEEDINGS COMMENCED HEREUNDER MAY BE JOINED WITH OR INCLUDE ANY OTHER PARTIES, OR CLAIMS BY OTHER PARTIES (WHETHER REPRESENTATIVE, MASS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION).\nEach party agrees that this limitation includes, but is not limited to, precluding each party from pursuing any claim for public injunctive relief, whether in arbitration or court.\nIf we believe that any claim you have filed is inconsistent with this limitation, then you agree that we may seek an order from a court determining whether your claim is within the scope of this class action waiver.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that any part of this Dispute Resolution provision cannot be enforced, the rest of this Dispute Resolution provision will continue to apply.\nprovided, however, that if the Class Action Waiver is declared to be unenforceable or invalid, this entire Dispute Resolution provision (other than this sentence) will not apply to that claim (but will still apply to any and all other claims that you or we may assert in that or any other action).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>18.\nMiscellaneous.</b>\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>18.1 <b>\n<i>

mobile wallet, such as Apple Pay\u00ae, PayPal\u00ae or Google Pay\u2122, then you understand loading/reloading of funds using those third-party mobile wallets is governed by the separate terms and conditions of that particular mobile wallet, including management of separate payment accounts loaded into those mobile wallets.\nFor example, using Apple Pay\u00ae with the Touch ID\u00ae function to pay is governed by the separate Apple Pay\u00ae terms and conditions, and not these Terms.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When you initiate an initial load to your Whataburger Virtual Gift Card account linked

be made to the order.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you place a delivery order, an Online Order through the Whataburger Website(s), or your order is a Large Order placed through the Mobile App, the preparation of your order will start based on the delivery time or pickup time you select, as applicable.\nFor pickup orders, if you arrive early to pick up an order placed through the Whataburger Website(s) or a Large Order placed through the Mobile App, you may check-in at the Online Order register, which will direct Whataburger to begin early preparation of your order.\nIf you place an Online Order for pickup through the Whataburger Mobile App, and your order is not a Large Order, the preparation of your order will start when you select the \u201cASAP\u201d button within the Mobile

provider will process your total amount to the payment card you selected when you built the order.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In some locations, you may be able to place an order for delivery.\nTo place a delivery order, you must provide a delivery address (physical address only) and phone number where you can be contacted.\nDelivery service is not available in all Whataburger locations.\nDelivery

and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate in asserting any available defenses.\nIn the event of any third party claim that the Whataburger Online Services or your possession and use of the Whataburger Online Services infringes that third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, Whataburger, not Apple, Google or the operator of any other app store or marketplace, will be solely responsible for controlling the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement

hereunder will be governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to its conflicts of law principles.\nThe United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and Services shall have no applicability.\nWe are located in Texas and that is where you entered into these Terms and opened your MyWhataburger Account.\nIn addition, we are subject to certain federal and state regulations and we must comply with these laws, regulations and rules.\nYou agree that if there is any inconsistency between these Terms and any applicable law, regulation or rule, these Terms will prevail to the extent any such law, regulation or rule may be modified by agreement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY.\nIT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH WHATABURGER AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF.\nTHIS SECTION OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE REFERRED TO AS THE \u201cARBITRATION AGREEMENT.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<u>ARBITRATION</u>.\nYOU AND WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS, OR THE BREACH THEREOF, INCLUDING ANY QUESTIONS OF ARBITRABILITY (\u201cDISPUTE\u201d), SHALL BE SETTLED BY ARBITRATION ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (\u201cAAA\u201d) IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS CONSUMER ARBITRATION RULES BY A SOLE ARBITRATOR.\nYou and we each also agree that this Arbitration Agreement affects interstate commerce so that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law, not state law, apply and govern any questions regarding the enforceability of this dispute resolution provision, including all questions of arbitrability (despite the general choice of law provision set forth below).\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nTHE ARBITRATOR MUST FOLLOW THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For any Dispute, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve your claim by sending a written description of your claim to Whataburger, Inc., ATTN: Legal Department, 300 Concord Plaza Drive, San Antonio TX 78216.\nYou and we each agree to negotiate your claim in good faith for a sixty-day period.\nYou further agree that you may not commence any arbitration or court proceeding unless you and we are unable to resolve the claim within 60 days after we receive your claim description and you have made a good faith effort to resolve your claim directly with us during that time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<u>WAIVER OF CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED ACTIONS (\u201cCLASS ACTION WAIVER\u201d)</u>.\nYOU AND WE EACH AGREE THAT YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY ON YOUR OWN BEHALF, AND NOT IN ANY REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR ON BEHALF OF ANY CLASS OR PURPORTED CLASS, AND NO PROCEEDINGS COMMENCED HEREUNDER MAY BE JOINED WITH OR INCLUDE ANY OTHER PARTIES, OR CLAIMS BY OTHER PARTIES (WHETHER REPRESENTATIVE, MASS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION).\nEach party agrees that this limitation includes, but is not limited to, precluding each party from pursuing any claim for public injunctive relief, whether in arbitration or court.\nIf we believe that any claim you have filed is inconsistent with this limitation, then you agree that we may seek an order from a court determining whether your claim is within the scope of this class action waiver.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that any part of this Dispute Resolution provision cannot be enforced, the rest of this Dispute Resolution provision will continue to apply.\nprovided, however, that if the Class Action Waiver is declared to be unenforceable or invalid, this entire Dispute Resolution provision (other than this sentence) will not apply to that claim (but will still apply to any and all other claims that you or we may assert in that or any other action).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>18.\nMiscellaneous.</b>\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>18.1 <b>\n<i>
