Here, you can be whoever or whatever you want to be, as long as you don't abuse this freedom to deceive others, to spy on people or to gain unfair advantages.\n</p>Lurkers Welcome!<p>Many communities are not very fond of lurkers (users who silently read but don't actively participate themselves).\nHere, this is different.\nWe know that stealthy users and unregistered visitors are an invaluable part of our community, and we welcome that.\nThat's why we do our best to make Belletristica as comfortable as possible for visitors.\nThe majority of our contents can be enjoyed without an account, and we never use those irritating pup-ups to pressure you into signing up.\n</p>Personal DataPersonal Data in Your Profile<p>We offer the option to share some private data like name, age and gender on your profile.\nThis serves merely to individualize your profile, and is totally voluntary - please never share anything you're not comfortable sharing.\nWe don't further process this information, we do not sell it to anyone, and we don't use them for targeted ads.\nYou can completely erase all this data yourself at any time.\n</p>Shipping Addresses<p>We only ever ask for your address, if you explicitly want us to mail something to you.\nAfter that, we forget we even have your address, and we only mail you again when you ask us to.\nWe won't bother you with unsolicited advertisements just because you kindly ordered some flyers once.\n</p>Cookies<p>Like pretty much every other website, we use cookies (small data files that are stored on your device).\nWe need them for many important functions like the \"remember me\" option on login, the autosave feature, in case you lose your internet connection while writing, and for smart \"back\" links, that need to temporarily remember where you came from.\n</p>Anonymous Statistics<p>We automatically generate a few anonymous statistics (like how many users have been online on a given day) but we don't include any data that could identify a single person.\n</p>Request data deletion<p>Although you can easily delete all your personal data and close your account by yourself in your profile and account settings and we don't collect any personal data for marketing purposes or such, you can still also request deletion of your account and/or all personal data simply via email to support@belletristica.com.\n</p>Your TextsCopyright<p>We don't claim any possession of the texts you upload.\nAll your works stay your own intellectual property and you fully keep all rights.\nWe also automatically add a copyright note to your texts, which says that it belongs to you.\nIn case of a dispute with a third party, we'll gladly comfirm the exact time when you first uploaded your text on Belletristica.\n</p>Texts in the Archive<p>We keep deleted texts locked away in our archive (unless you insist on them being deleted for good).\nTexts in our archive are not accessible to the public, and are usually never seen again by anyone.\n</p>\n<p>Why do we do this? For copyright reasons.\nImagine the following situation:\n</p>\n<p>Let's say you puplish a poem on Belletristica in spring.\nThen, in summer, someone steals it and publishes it on another platform.\nYou delete your poem in autumn.\nThen, winter comes, and you discover the stolen text on the other platform.\nNow we can check the archive and say: \"Hold on, this text has already been uploaded on Belletristica this march!\" and do what we can to help you enforce your copyright.\n</p>\n<p>You can of course demand the complete deletion of your texts from the archive, and we will take care of it quickly.\nHowever, if you choose do that, we can't help you with any copyright disputes over this text in the future.\n</p>\n<p>To have your texts deleted from the archive, just request deletion via email to support@belletristica.com.\n</p>Data SecuritySecure Connection<p>We consistently use SSL encryption to ensure a secure connection between your device and Belletristica.\nAlso, we have taken further precautions against data theft, but for security reasons, we won't elaborate this.\n</p>Daily Backups<p>We make daily backups of our database, so that we can minimize data loss in worst case scenarios.\nThese backups however, are never stored for longer than a month.\n</p>External ServicesHosting<p>We use Amazon AWS.\nAll data, including our database as well as user uploads, are located in Frankfurt, Germany.\nAmazon AWS itself is GDPR conform: pricacy policy of Amazon.\n</p>Amazon.de PartnerNet<p>Belletristica is a participant in the Amazon EU Associates Programme, an affiliate advertising programme designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.de\n</p>OtherDisclaimer<p>These policies might be expanded or changed in the future.\nWhen this happens, we will inform our users per email in time.\nThe philosophy behind our policies will stay the same though.\n</p>Questions? We're happy to answer them.<p>Just write an email to support@belletristica.com or directly talk to one or our fairies or admins.\nWe'll respond as quickly as possible.\n</p>\n<i>\n</i>Expand footerAbout BelletristicaLanding PageTeamRoadmapSupport BelleMiscellaneousAchievementsCommunity EventsBonus CodesBenefitsFan Art GalleryCommunity ChallengeBelle's BookshelfBelle Story CollectionsFestivalsOur WorldThe EnchiridionThe JuridicumMap of BelletristicaAboutPressPrivacyVersion 2.0.51<i>\n</i>\n<i>\n</i>\n<i>\n</i>\n<i>\n</i>Field is requiredNot a valid emailNot a valid URLNot a valid numberNot a valid dateValue too lowValue too highJust now% seconds ago1 minute ago% minutes ago1 hour ago% hours ago1 day ago% days ago1 week ago% weeks ago1 month ago% months ago1 year ago% years ago<i>\n</i>\n<i>\n</i>\n<i>\n</i>+ g Fairy Dust", "created_at": "2023-07-13 21:23:04.902562", "updated_at": "2023-07-13 21:23:24.454502"}, {"id": 17882, "name": "Impressum", "url": "https://belletristica.com/en/about", "xpath": "//body", "text": null, "created_at": "2023-07-13 21:23:04.931615", "updated_at": "2023-07-13 21:23:43.647655"}], "points": [], "urls": ["belletristica.com"]}}
