Privacy Policy covers how Osano treats information collected and received through the Privacy Monitor software, developed for (and offered to) consumers in order to provide them with more transparency and control over how their information is used by other companies.\nLearn more about the Privacy Monitor software.</p> What Information We Collect <p>We limit the information we collect only to what\u2019s necessary to insure the software operates correctly and provides you with feedback related to data collection and privacy practices of the website you are using (e.g., a privacy score).\nYou are not required to sign-up, register or provide personal information about yourself in order to download and use the Privacy Monitor solution.</p>\n<p>When you use the Privacy Monitor software, we collect the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nInternet Protocol Address (\u201cIP address\u201d).\nIP addresses are assigned by your Internet service provider (e.g., Comcast/Xfinity, AT&amp;T, Time Warner, Verizon, Charter, etc.) to the modem used to access the Internet for connected devices in your home and/or work-place.\nAny devices using the modem to access the Internet may broadcast the same IP address.\nAt home, connected devices could include one or more laptop/desktop computers, tablets, mobile phones, smart/connected TVs and gaming consoles.\nAt work, connected devices could include one (or all) floor(s) in an office building.</li>\n<li>\nRoot Domain Name &amp.\nUser Agent.\nWhen you visit a website, the Privacy Monitor software will send us a request (for a privacy score) that includes the root domain name of the website (more commonly, the domain name of a site\u2019s home page).\nDue to the nature of how the Internet works, we may also receive information (known as \u201cUser Agent\u201d) automatically sent by your web browser, such as data associated with the source device\u2019s Internet browser/content delivery software (e.g., Microsoft Explorer, Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome).\nThe User Agent information we receive may also include information such as device type (e.g., computer, tablet, mobile device), and/or date/time

monitoring.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nIP address.\nIf you have the Privacy Monitor software (plug-in or app) installed on your device, when you visit a website, or send us a request to monitor the privacy disclosures of a website, we will receive IP addresses automatically.\nThe software receives IP address from your Internet-browser (e.g., Microsoft Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome) each time the Privacy Monitor software is notified that you are visiting a site (or initiating a request to monitor a site), so that we can return information to you about the website\u2019s privacy practices (e.g., a privacy score).</li>\n<li>\nRoot Domain Name &amp.\nUser Agent.\nSimilar to the collection of IP address, if you have the Privacy Monitor software (plug-in or app) on your device, when you visit a website, or send us a request to monitor the privacy disclosures of a website, the software is notified and receives the root domain name of the website you are visiting (more commonly, the domain name of a site\u2019s home page) so that we can return information to you about the website\u2019s privacy practices (e.g.\na privacy score).\nThe software also receive User Agent information associated with your browser (e.g., Microsoft Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, etc.) and type of device (e.g., whether the device is running a Windows or Apple operating system), which allows us, among other things, to return a privacy score that is formatted for proper display in the Privacy Monitor software on your device.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you choose to contact us directly with an inquiry (by email or postal mail) using the contact information available to you on the PrivacyMonitor.com website, we will receive your contact information and use it to provide you with a response.</p> How We Use the Information We Collect <ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Osano Privacy Scores</em>\n</p>\n<p>The principal way we use the limited information we collect is to provide you, the

during a given period of time, and the types of devices the software is being used on.\nThe information can\u2019t be used to identify an individual and is used by us to help improve the solution for
