and financial matters;</li>\n<li>Prohibit anonymous reports.\nor</li>\n<li>Disallow reports concerning Foundation personnel except employees in key or management functions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Accordingly,

place.</p>\nWhat additional data we collect about reporters of improper conduct\n<p>\n<strong>Data you provide about yourself<br>\n</strong>When reporting improper conduct, unless you choose to report anonymously, we may ask you to provide personal data about yourself, such as your name and contact information (e.g., phone number and/or email address).\nWe will ask you to provide a description of the conduct reported.</p>\n<p>The information you submit will be treated as confidential, except where required otherwise by applicable law, but in all cases, will be handled with sensitivity.\nWe encourage you to identify yourself (in lieu of reporting anonymously) so that we can follow up with you about any questions we may have and so we may best address the issues raised.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data you provide about others<br>\n</strong>When reporting improper conduct, we may ask you to provide the name and contact information of the persons in your report.\nWe will ask you to provide a description of the conduct reported, which also may include other personal data about the persons in your report.</p>\n<p>As the information you report may result in

tolerated.</p>\nHow we use this additional data\n<p>In addition to the uses specified under the Privacy &amp.\nCookies Notice, we may use personal data that we collect in this context to: contact you (unless you have asked to remain anonymous) [<em>for our legitimate interests</em>].\nconduct an investigation [<em>for our legitimate interests and/or to comply with legal obligations</em>].\nensure

additional data\n<p>\n<strong>General<br>\n</strong>We may share your personal data with Foundation employees, representatives, agents, external legal counsel, and contractors who have a need to know the information in order to conduct an investigation or respond to claims relating to the reported conduct.\nWe also may share your personal data with law enforcement if required by applicable law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Subject of the report<br>\n</strong>We will promptly notify any person who is the subject of a report, except where notice needs to be delayed to help ensure the integrity of the investigation or the preservation of relevant information.\nWith some exceptions, the subject of the report may access information concerning the report, but not the identity of the reporter, and may in certain cases request correction of personal data that is inaccurate or incomplete in accordance with applicable law.</p>\nHow long we keep this additional data\n<p>The information you provide will be kept as long as necessary to conduct an investigation, maintain records of that investigation and any actions taken, or, if applicable, as long as necessary to fulfill our legal requirements.</p>\nHow you can access and control this additional data\n<p>EthicsPoint\u2122&nbsp;users are given a report key to access and follow up their report on a self-service basis at any time.\nAs noted above, subject to certain exceptions, others may request and obtain access to personal data about them contained in the report.</p>\n<p>If you wish to correct, amend or delete your personal data please contact us.\nPlease note that neither changes to, or deletion of, such personal data will alter personal data already relied upon or no longer in our control.</p>\nHow to contact
