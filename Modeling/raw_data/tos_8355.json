shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand the its content or exercise his/her rights.\nOn request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information.\nThis Clause is without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.4 Accuracy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If the data importer becomes aware that the personal data it has received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the data exporter without undue delay.\nIn this case, the data importer shall cooperate with the data exporter to erase or rectify the data.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.5 Duration of processing and erasure or return of data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Processing by the data importer shall only take place for the duration specified in Annex I.B.\nAfter the end of the provision of the processing services, the data importer shall, at the choice of the data exporter, delete all personal data processed on behalf of the data exporter and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, or return to the data exporter all personal data processed on its behalf and delete existing copies.\nUntil the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses.\nIn case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit return or deletion of the personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the extent and for as long as required under that local law.\nThis is without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement for the data importer under Clause 14(e) to notify the data exporter throughout the duration of the contract if it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under Clause 14(a).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.6 Security of processing</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the data, including protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to that data (hereinafter\u2018personal data breach\u2019).\nIn assessing the appropriate level of security, the Parties shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subjects.\nThe Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner.\nIn case of pseudonymisation, the additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject shall, where possible, remain under the exclusive control of the data exporter.\nIn complying with its obligations under this paragraph, the data importer shall at least implement the technical and organisational measures specified in Annex II.\nThe data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.</li>\n<li>The data importer shall grant access to the personal data to members of its personnel only to the extent strictly necessary for the implementation, management and monitoring of the contract.\nIt shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.</li>\n<li>In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the dataimporterunder these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the breach,including measures to mitigate its adverse effects.\nThe data importer shall also notify the data exporter without undue delay after having become aware of the breach.\nSuch notification shall contain the details of a contact point where more information can be obtained, a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.\nWhere, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide all information at the same time, the initial notification shall contain the information then available and further information shall, as it becomes available, subsequently be provided without undue delay.</li>\n<li>The data importer shall cooperate with and assist the data exporter to enable the data exporter to comply with its obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular to notify the competent supervisory authority and the affected data subjects, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the data importer.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>8.7 Sensitive data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person\u2019s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions and offences (hereinafter \u2018sensitive data\u2019), the data importer shall apply the specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards described in Annex I.B.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.8 Onward transfers</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The data importer shall only disclose the personal data to a third party on documented instructions from the data exporter.\nIn addition, the data may only be disclosed to a third party located outside the European Union (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter \u2018onward transfer\u2019) if the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, , under the appropriate Module, or if:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the onward transfer is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer;</li>\n<li>the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 Regulation of (EU) 2016/679 with respect to the processing in question;</li>\n<li>the onward transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings.\nor</li>\n<li>) the onward transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the datasubject or of another natural person.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Any onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in particular purpose limitation.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.9 Documentation and compliance</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The data importer shall promptly and adequately deal with enquiries from the data exporter that relate to the processing under these Clauses.</li>\n<li>The Parties shall be able to demonstrate compliance with these Clauses.\nIn particular, the data importer shall keep appropriate documentation on the processing activities carried out on behalf of the data exporter.</li>\n<li>The data importer shall make available to the data exporter all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out in these Clauses and at the data exporter\u2019s request, allow for and contribute to audits of the processing activities covered by these Clauses, at reasonable intervals or if there are indications of non-compliance.\nIn deciding on a review or audit, the data exporter may take into account relevant certifications held by the data importer.</li>\n<li>The data exporter may choose to conduct the audit by itself or mandate an independent auditor.\nAudits may include inspections at the premises or physical facilities of the data importer and shall, where appropriate, be carried out with reasonable notice.</li>\n<li>The Parties shall make the information referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c), including the results of any audits, available to the competent supervisory authority on request.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>Clause 9<br>\n<em>Use of sub-processors</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>GENERAL WRITTEN AUTHORISATION The data importer has the data exporter\u2019s general authorisation for the engagement of sub-processor(s) from an agreed list.\nThe data importer shall specifically inform the data exporter in writing of any intended changes to that list through the addition or replacement of sub-processors at least ten(10) days in advance, thereby giving the data exporter sufficient time to be able to object to such changes prior to the engagement of the sub-processor(s).\nThe data importer shall provide the data exporter with the information necessary to enable the data exporter to exercise its right to object.</li>\n<li>Where the data importer engages a sub-processor to carry out specific processing activities (on behalf of the data exporter), it shall do so by way of a written contract that provides for, in substance, the same data protection obligations as those binding the data importer under these ACTIVE/110240378.1 7 Clauses, including in terms of third-party beneficiary rights for data subjects.\n1 The Parties agree that, by complying with this Clause, the data importer fulfils its obligations under Clause 8.8.\nThe data importer shall ensure that the sub-processor complies with the obligations to which the data importer is subject pursuant to these Clauses.</li>\n<li>The data importer shall provide, at the data exporter\u2019s request, a copy of such a sub- processor agreement and any subsequent amendments to the data exporter.\nTo the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the data importer may redact the text of the agreement prior to sharing a copy.</li>\n<li>The data importer shall remain fully responsible to the data exporter for the performance of the sub-processor\u2019s obligations under its contract with the data importer.\nThe data importer shall notify the data exporter of any failure by the sub- processor to fulfil its obligations under that contract</li>\n<li>The data importer shall agree a third-party beneficiary clause with the sub-processor whereby -- in the event the data importer has factually disappeared, ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent -- the data exporter shall have the right to terminate the sub-processor contract and to instruct the sub-processor to erase or return the personal data.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>Clause 10<br>\n<em>Data subject rights</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The data importer shall promptly notify the data exporter of any request it has received from a data subject.\nIt shall not respond to that request itself unless it has been authorised to do so by the data exporter.</li>\n<li>The data importer shall assist the data exporter in fulfilling its obligations to respond to data subjects\u2019 requests for the exercise of their rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.\nIn this regard, the Parties shall set out in Annex II the appropriate technical and organisational measures, taking into account the nature of the processing, by which the assistance shall be provided, as well as the scope and the extent of the assistance required.</li>\n<li>In fulfilling its obligations under paragraphs (a) and (b), the data importer shall comply with the instructions from the data exporter.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>Clause 11<br>\n<em>Redress</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The data importer shall inform data subjects in a transparent and easily accessible format, through individual notice or on its website, of a contact point authorised to handle complaints.\nIt shall deal promptly with any complaints it receives from a data subject.</li>\n<li>In case of a dispute between a data subject and one of the Parties as regards compliance with these Clauses, that Party shall use its best efforts to resolve the issue amicably in a timely fashion.\nThe Parties shall keep each other informed about such disputes and, where ACTIVE/110240378.1 8 appropriate, cooperate in resolving them.</li>\n<li>Where the data subject invokes a third-party beneficiary right pursuant to Clause 3, the data importer shall accept the decision of the data subject to:<ol>\n<li>lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in the Member State of his/her habitual residence or place of work, or the competent supervisory authority pursuant to Clause 13;</li>\n<li>refer the dispute to the competent courts within the meaning of Clause 18.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The Parties accept that the data subject may be represented by a not-for-profit body, organisation or association under the conditions set out in Article 80(1) of

the data subject by breaching the third-party beneficiary rights under these Clauses.</li>\n<li>Notwithstanding paragraph (b), the data exporter shall be liable to the data subject, and the data subject shall be entitled to receive compensation, for any material or non-material damages the data exporter or the data importer (or its sub-processor) causes the data subject by breaching the third-party beneficiary rights under these Clauses.\nThis is without prejudice to the liability of the data exporter and, where the data exporter is a processor acting on behalf of a controller, to the liability of the controller under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, as applicable.</li>\n<li>The Parties agree that if the data exporter is held liable under paragraph (c) for damages caused by the data importer (or its sub-processor), it shall be entitled to claim back from the data importer that part of the compensation corresponding to the data importer\u2019s responsibility for the damage.</li>\n<li>Where more than one Party is responsible for any damage caused to the data subject as a result of a breach of these Clauses, all responsible Parties shall be jointly and severally liable and the data subject is entitled to bring an action in court against any of these Parties.</li>\n<li>The Parties agree that if one Party is held liable under paragraph (e), it shall be entitled to claim back from the other Party/ies that part of the compensation corresponding to its / their responsibility for the damage.</li>\n<li>The data importer may not invoke the conduct of a sub-processor to avoid its own liability.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>Clause 13<br>\n<em>Supervision</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Where the data exporter is established in an EU Member State: The supervisory authority with responsibility for ensuring compliance by the data exporter with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as regards the data transfer, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.<p>The supervisory authority of one of the Member States in which the data subjects whose personal data is transferred under these Clauses in relation to the offering of goods or services to them, or whose behaviour is monitored, are located, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The data importer

supervisory authority with written confirmation that the necessary actions have been taken.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>Section 3 - Local Laws and Obligations in case of access by public authorities</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Clause 14<br>\n<em>Local Laws and Obligations in Case of Access by Public Authorities</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data importer, including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses.\nThis is based on the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.</li>\n<li>The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following elements:<ol>\n<li>the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels

paragraph (b) and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.</li>\n<li>The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a).</li>\n<li>Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g.\ntechnical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or data importer to address the situation.\nThe data exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed the competent supervisory authority to do so.\nIn this case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses.\nIf

fundamental principles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.</li>\n<li>We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.</li>\n<li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.</li>\n<li>We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below is KnowledgeOwl's privacy policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.</p>Who We Are<p>We are the folks behind KnowledgeOwl, an online knowledge base software tool.\nFor the purposes of the GDPR, we are both a data controller and a data processor.</p>What This Policy Covers<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our websites (including https://www.knowledgeowl.com and https://support.knowledgeowl.com);</li>\n<li>Our application (https://app.knowledgeowl.com).\nand</li>\n<li>Other products and services that are available on or through our websites and application (including our widget, API, and various integrations like the Zendesk app).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Throughout this Privacy Policy we\u2019ll refer to our websites, application, and other products and services collectively as \u201cServices.\u201d Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.</p>Information We Collect<p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so\u2013for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.\nWe collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our services, and from outside sources.</p>Information You Provide to Us<p>It\u2019s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us.\nThe amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information.\nHere are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Basic Account Information</strong>: We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account.\nFor example, we require individuals who sign up for a KnowledgeOwl account to provide a first name, a last name, and email address.\nYou may provide us with more information\u2013like your company name and billing address\u2013but we don\u2019t require that information to create your account.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Transaction and Billing Information</strong>: If you purchase something from us\u2013a subscription to a KnowledgeOwl plan or a custom domain, for example\u2013you will provide additional personal and payment information that is required to process the transaction and your payment, such as your name, credit card information, and contact information.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Content Information</strong>: When using KnowledgeOwl, you may also provide us with information about you in the content for your knowledge base.\nFor example, if you write an article that includes biographic information about you, we will have that information, and so will anyone with access to your knowledge base.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Credentials</strong>: Depending on the Services you use, you may provide us with credentials for third-party services which you want to integrate with KnowledgeOwl For example, you might provide us with your Zendesk username, domain, and API key to set up a contact form integration.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Communications with Us</strong>: You may also provide us information when you respond to emails, communicate with our support team, or post a comment on our knowledge base.</li>\n</ul>Information We Collect Automatically<p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Log Information</strong>: Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information.\nWe collect log information when you use our Services\u2013for example, when you create or make changes to your knowledge base.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Usage Information</strong>: We collect information about your usage of our Services.\nFor example, we collect information about the actions that site administrators and users perform on a site\u2013in other words, who did what, when and to what thing on a site.\nWe also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, support document searches, button clicks) along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, operating system, browser).\nWe use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our Services better.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Location Information</strong>: We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address.\nWe collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Information from Cookies &amp.\nOther Technologies</strong>: A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor\u2019s computer, and that the visitor\u2019s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.\nPixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and e-mails.\nKnowledgeOwl uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand marketing campaign effectiveness.</li>\n</ul>Information We Collect from Other Sources<p>We may also get information about you from other sources.\nFor example, if you log into your KnowledgeOwl account using SSO from a third-party identity provider, we will receive information from that service (such as your username/email, first name, and email) via the authorization procedures used by that service.\nThe information we receive depends on which services you authorize and integrate with your KnowledgeOwl account.</p>How We Use Information<p>We use information about you as mentioned above and as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To provide our Services\u2013for example, to set up and maintain your account or charge you for any of our paid Services;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To further develop our Services\u2013for example by adding new features that we think our users will enjoy or will help them to create and manage their knowledge bases more efficiently;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services, which helps us improve our Services and make them easier to use;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To monitor and protect the security of our Services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and property of KnowledgeOwl and others;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To communicate with you about KnowledgeOwl services and others we think will be of interest to you, solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date on KnowledgeOwl and our products.\nand</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To personalize your experience using our Services and provide recommendations.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>Sharing InformationHow We Share Information<p>We do not sell our users\u2019 private personal information.\nWe share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors</strong>: We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information on our behalf.\nWe require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Party Vendors:</strong> We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us.\nThis group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like payment providers that process your credit and debit card information) and those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers).\nWe require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>As Required by Law</strong>: We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>To Protect Rights and Property</strong>: We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of KnowledgeOwl, third parties, or the public at large.\nFor example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Business Transfers</strong>: In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that KnowledgeOwl goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.\nIf any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>With Your Consent</strong>: We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction.\nFor example, we may share your information with third parties with which you authorize us to do so, such as setting up integrations with ticketing systems or analytics tools.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Aggregated and De-Identified Information</strong>: We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you.\nFor instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Knowledge Base Users</strong>: If you leave a comment or use the contact form on a website that uses our Services (like a knowledge base created in KnowledgeOwl), the information you provide - like your email address and name - may be shared with the users of the site where you left the comment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Published Support Requests</strong>: And if you send us a request (for example, via a support email or one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.\nYour personal information, such as you name or email, will not be shared to protect your privacy.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>Information Shared Publicly<p>Information that you choose to make public is\u2013you guessed it\u2013disclosed publicly.\nThat means that information like your comments or articles that you make public on your knowledge base are all available to others.\n&nbsp;Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.\nPlease keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share.</p>Choices<p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Limit the Information that You Provide</strong>: If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information.\nPlease keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our Services may not be accessible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Set Your Browser to Reject Cookies</strong>: You can usually choose to set your browser to, or use a tool that will, remove or reject browser cookies before using KnowledgeOwl services, with the drawback that certain features of KnowledgeOwl services may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>Other Things You Should KnowQuestions<p>If you have question about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at support@knowledgeowl.com.&nbsp;</p>Security<p>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so.\nTo enhance the security of your account, we encourage you to enable our advanced security settings, like Force SSL Links and Single Sign-On.</p>Transferring Information<p>KnowledgeOwl is a worldwide service.\nBy accessing or using the Services or otherwise providing
