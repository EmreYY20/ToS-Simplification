purposes (known as \"controllers\") and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as \"processors\").</p>\n<p>MaxMind, located at the address set forth in Section 11 above, generally operates as a processor on behalf of its customers that use the MaxMind's services.\nThe MaxMind customer, the controller, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.\nSpecifically, MaxMind's customer decides what personal data to share with MaxMind in order for MaxMind to provide the customer with robust risk score information, certain licensed data, the ability to flag potentially fraudulent activity, and other services as purchased by the customer.\nPlease visit the applicable customer's privacy policy for information about their privacy practices.</p>\n<p>MaxMind also operates as a controller with respect to certain of its services and/or databases.\nFor example, MaxMind operates as a controller in connection with personal data collected from visitors through its website, including through data correction requests.\nAlso, when MaxMind combines personal data from different customers, like many kinds of analytics services, it may do this both as a processor at its customers' instruction and as a controller itself for the purpose of providing services to all of its customers.\nFor example, MaxMind may process and aggregate or otherwise de-identify some of the personal data that a customer shares with MaxMind in order to make that personal data part of another database for one or more other services provided to MaxMind customers.</p> Data Subject Rights <p>If you are a data subject in the European Union or UK, you have the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal data we have collected about you through the Services.\nYou also have the right to data portability and the right to restrict or object to our processing of personal data we have collected about you through the Services.\nIn addition, you have the right to ask us not to process your personal data (or provide it to third parties to process) for marketing purposes or purposes materially different than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you.\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing we do based on consent you have provided to us.</p>\n<p>To exercise any of these rights, contact us using the information at Section 11 above and specify which right you intend to exercise.\nWe will respond to your request within 30 days.\nWe may require additional information from you to allow us to confirm your identity.\nPlease note that we store information as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, and may continue to retain and use the information even after a data subject request for purposes of our legitimate interests, including as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements.</p>\n<p>If your information has been processed by us on behalf of one of our customers and you wish to exercise any rights you have with such information, please inquire with our customer directly.\nIf you wish to make your request directly to MaxMind, please provide the name of the MaxMind customer on whose behalf MaxMind processes your information.\nWe will refer your request to that customer, and will support them to the extent required by applicable law in responding to your request.</p>\n<p>If you have any issues with our compliance, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a European supervisory authority.</p> International Transfer <p>For personal data transferred from the European Union, the UK, and Switzerland to third countries that do not ensure an adequate level of data protection, we will provide appropriate safeguards, such as through the use of Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>\n<p>In addition, MaxMind participates in the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from the European Union, the United Kingdom and Switzerland to the United States, respectively.\nMaxMind has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.\nIn light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidating Privacy Shield, MaxMind will continue to process personal data transferred in reliance on Privacy Shield using appropriate safeguards in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles.</p>\n<p>MaxMind is subject to the investigatory and enforcement jurisdiction of the United States Federal Trade Commission where MaxMind has transferred personal data in reliance on Privacy Shield.\nWe hereby affirm our commitment to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles for all personal data transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom and Switzerland in reliance on Privacy Shield.\nThis means that MaxMind shall be liable to you for any third party agent to which we transfer your personal data in reliance on Privacy Shield and that processes such personal data in a manner that violates the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we can demonstrate that we are not responsible for the resulting damages.\nMaxMind takes reasonable steps to ensure that personal data is relevant to its intended use and is accurate, complete, and current and retained only as long as needed for an intended or compatible purpose.</p>\n<p>Any inquiries or complaints relating to MaxMind's compliance with Privacy Shield, including any requests for access or correction of personal data, may be addressed to our Data Protection Officer set forth in Section 11 of this Privacy Policy.\nMaxMind will investigate and attempt to resolve any inquiries brought to its attention.\nMaxMind has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, operated by BBB National Programs.\nIf you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit https://bbbprograms.org/privacy-shield-complaints/ for more information and to file a complaint.\nThis service is provided free of charge to you.\nUnder limited circumstances, in the event your complaint is not resolved through these channels a binding arbitration option may be available for a Privacy Shield Panel.</p>\n<p>Where MaxMind has transferred personal data in reliance on Privacy Shield, if there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield

license to do the following with\nthe Services you have purchased:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li> You may access and use the Services for your own Internal Restricted Business Purposes.\n</li>\n<li> You may use the Web Services (but not the GeoIP Databases) to provide Geolocation Functionality for applications or products, even if such applications or products are accessible to parties other than you or your employees (Note: You may use the GeoIP Databases or GeoIP Data to provide Geolocation Functionality for applications or products only if those applications and products are accessible only to you and your employees.) </li>\n<li> You may sublicense the Web Services (but not the GeoIP Databases) to your customers provided that (i) all use by you and your customers of the Web Services complies with the terms and restrictions set forth in this Agreement (including the minFraud Service Terms of Use, if applicable) and (ii) any query to the minFraud Service made by you, or on behalf of your customer, includes a ShopID as an input field.\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nYou agree to use the Services and products only in a manner that is consistent\nwith applicable laws.\nYou understand and agree that

use of the Web Services, create compilations or derivative works of the Services for any purpose other than your own Internal Restricted Business Purposes.\n</li>\n<li> use the Services in any manner that is beyond the scope of the rights granted in this Agreement.\n</li>\n<li> except as explicitly permitted hereunder for your use of the Web Services, store in a retrieval system accessible to the public, transfer, publish, distribute, display to others, broadcast, sell, or sublicense the Services, or any portion thereof.\n</li>\n<li> remove or obscure any copyright notice or other notice or terms of use contained in the Services.\n</li>\n<li> use the Services to create or otherwise support the transmission of unsolicited, commercial email.\n</li>\n<li> remove, disable, avoid, circumvent,

explicitly permitted by this Agreement or after notifying MaxMind of the anticipated disclosure and obtaining MaxMind's prior written consent to the disclosure.\nTo the extent you disclose the GeoIP Databases or GeoIP Data to a third party as permitted by this Agreement, you will impose upon the third party the same or substantially similar contractual duties imposed on you and the rights provided to MaxMind as in this Agreement, including those in Section 3 (Limited Grant Of Rights), Section 4 (Restrictions), and the Addendum.\nYou are responsible for the acts or omissions of any third parties with which you share the GeoIP Databases or GeoIP Data.\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>Destruction of GeoIP Database and GeoIP Data.</u> From time to time, MaxMind will release an updated version of the GeoIP Databases, and you agree to promptly use the updated version of the GeoIP Databases.\nYou shall cease use of and destroy (i) any old versions of the GeoIP Databases and GeoIP Data within thirty (30) days following the release of the updated GeoIP Databases.\nand (ii) all GeoIP Databases and GeoIP Data immediately upon termination of the license under this Agreement.\nUpon request, you

by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C.\n\u00a71681 et seq.\n(\"FCRA\"), and that the Services do not constitute \"consumer reports\" as defined in the FCRA.\nYou understand that any information you provide to MaxMind in order to use the Services has not been collected by MaxMind for credit purposes and is not intended to be indicative of any consumer's credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, or other characteristics listed in Section 603(d) of the FCRA.\nYou agree that you will not use the Services or any information received through the Services in whole or in part (i) as a factor in establishing a consumer's eligibility for credit, (ii) as a factor in establishing a consumer's eligibility for insurance, (iii) for employment purposes, (iv) in connection with a determination of an individual's eligibility for a license or other benefit granted by a governmental authority, or (v) in connection with any permissible purpose as defined by the FCRA.\nAny use of the Services by you in violation of this paragraph shall also constitute an unacceptable use.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\nACCURACY EXPECTATION: NO USE OF THE GEOIP DATA OR GEOIP2 PRECISION SERVICES FOR IDENTIFYING SPECIFIC HOUSEHOLDS OR INDIVIDUALS.\n<p>\nDue to the nature of geolocation technology and other factors beyond its\ncontrol, MaxMind cannot and does not guarantee the accuracy of the Services.\nThe GeoIP Databases and GeoIP2 Precision Services contain only the geographic data available and the\navailability of such data is not consistent for all regions.\nFurthermore, none\nof the Services reliably identifies any geographic level or division more\nprecise than the zip code or postal code associated with an IP address.\nAccordingly, it is imperative that MaxMind's customers not rely on the GeoIP\nData or GeoIP2 Precision Services to identify a specific household, individual, or street address.\nYou\nacknowledge the foregoing limitation of the Services and you will not\nuse or encourage others to use the Services for the purpose of identifying or\nlocating a specific household, individual, or street address.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li> NON-DISCLOSURE OF MINFRAUD SERVICE OUTPUTS.\n<p>\nExcept as explicitly provided in this Agreement, you may not, nor may you permit others to, disclose to any customer or other third party any output returned by the minFraud Service (e.g., such response\nvalues as the riskScore, proxyScore or proxy score, IP Risk Score, subscores,\nhigh risk flags), recognizing that the confidentiality of such information is\nvital to the performance of the minFraud service.\nDisclosure of such\ninformation shall be considered a material breach of this Agreement.\nFor the removal of doubt, you may provide outputs returned by the minFraud Service to customers to whom you have sublicensed the minFraud Service, but you may not provide any minFraud Service outputs to any individual whose transaction was evaluated by the minFraud Service.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nOWNERSHIP AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.\n<p>\nYou acknowledge and agree that MaxMind's trade secrets include the Services.\nYou further acknowledge and agree that\n(a) all intellectual property rights including copyrights, moral rights,\ntrademarks, trade secrets, and proprietary rights to the Services are\nexclusively owned by MaxMind and (b) you obtain no right, title, or interest\ntherein.\nYou hereby assign to MaxMind all copyrights, intellectual property\nrights, and any other proprietary or property rights or interests in and to any\nwork created in violation of this Agreement.\n</p>\n<p>\nMaxMind's successful maintenance and operation of the Services require that it\nstore, retain, and utilize data that is submitted to it by customers who use\nthe Services.\nAccordingly, and to the extent that any data submitted to\nMaxMind by you is protectable by copyright, moral rights, or any similar\nintellectual property laws in any jurisdiction, you hereby assign and agree to\nassign to MaxMind all right, title, and interest in and to such data and/or the\naggregated product of such data.\nTo the extent that you are legally or\ncontractually unable to assign the foregoing rights of ownership, then you\nhereby grant to MaxMind a fully paid-up, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable\nlicense to use, copy, distribute, make derivative works, and otherwise\ncommercially exploit all such data in connection with MaxMind's business.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, MaxMind shall comply with the terms of its own\nPrivacy Policy in place at the time of submission of any data to MaxMind.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION <ol>\n<li> \u201cConfidential Information\u201d includes all confidential and proprietary information or material disclosed by you or MaxMind (the \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d) to the other party (the \u201cReceiving Party\u201d) from which the Disclosing Party derives actual or potential economic value, and which is clearly marked or verbally identified at the time of disclosure as \u201cConfidential\u201d or is disclosed or learned under circumstances that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that the information was confidential.\nConfidential Information shall not include information that: (i) is or becomes publicly known through no act or omission of the Receiving Party.\n(ii) was in the Receiving Party\u2019s lawful possession before being disclosed to the Receiving Party by the Disclosing Party.\n(iii) is lawfully disclosed to the Receiving Party by any other third party not bound by any confidentiality obligation with respect to such information.\nor (iv) is independently developed by the Receiving Party.\n</li>\n<li> The parties acknowledge that each party may have access to Confidential Information of the other party.\nEach party shall use reasonable care to protect the Confidential Information of the other party.\nIn that regard, each party shall restrict access to Confidential Information to employees, contractors, and third parties as is reasonably required to exercise its rights and fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and only if such persons are subject to nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective as those set forth in this Agreement.\nNeither party shall, without prior written approval of the other party, use for such party\u2019s own benefit, publish, copy, or otherwise disclose to others, or permit the use by others for their benefit or to the detriment of the Disclosing Party, any Confidential Information.\nThe Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if required to do so under applicable law, rule or order, provided that the Receiving Party, where reasonably practicable and to the extent legally permissible, provides the Disclosing Party with prior written notice of the required disclosure so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy, and provided further that the Receiving Party discloses no more Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party than is reasonably necessary in order to respond to the required disclosure.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>PERSONAL DATA.\n<p>\nThe parties hereby agree to and incorporate by reference the Addendum, which shall apply to the extent the parties\nprocess any Personal Information (as defined in the Addendum) in connection with\nyour use of the Services.\nThe provisions of the Addendum relating to the processing of Personal Information (as defined in the Addendum) shall control over any conflicting provisions elsewhere in this Agreement.\nFor the removal of doubt, the Addendum is subject to the limitations of liability set forth in this Agreement.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nSECURITY.\n<p>\nYou will maintain reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational\nmeasures for the protection of the security, confidentiality, and integrity of\nany information you receive from MaxMind including without limitation, from the Services (including protection against\nunauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental or unlawful\ndestruction, loss, or alteration or damage, unauthorized disclosure of, or\naccess to, such data).\nIn the event you discover a data incident involving any\nsuch information, you shall promptly notify MaxMind and fully cooperate with\nMaxMind, at your own expense, in remediating the incident.\nYou are responsible\nfor all activities that occur under your password, license key, and similar\nmechanisms for account access (collectively \"Passwords\"), and shall keep your\nPasswords confidential.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nINDEMNIFICATION.\n<p>\nYou will indemnify and hold MaxMind and its

affiliate\nthereof as a result of your breach of any of the terms of this Agreement,\nincluding the Addendum.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nFEES.\n<p>\nMaxMind's current fee schedule for using the Services is

APIs.\nAny copying, implementation, or other use of any APIs\nprovided to you by MaxMind is subject to the license terms distributed with\nsuch APIs or their associated software or documentation.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nCHANGES TO THE AGREEMENT/TERMINATION.\n<ol>\n<li> MaxMind may amend this Agreement at any time.\nAny such amendment(s) shall be binding and effective upon the earlier of (i) the date that is thirty (30) days after the posting of the amended Agreement on the Website or (ii) the date that MaxMind provides notice to you of the amended Agreement, except that changes to charges and payment terms may be made only upon 30 days' prior written notice to you.\nYou may immediately terminate this Agreement upon written notice to MaxMind if a change is unacceptable to you.\nYour continued use of the Services following notice to you of a change shall constitute your acceptance of the change.\n</li>\n<li> If you find it convenient to employ your standard form(s) of purchase order or similar form in administering the terms of this Agreement, you may do so, but none of the terms and/or conditions printed or otherwise appearing or referenced on such form will be applicable to or shall modify or change your rights or obligations hereunder except for those terms and conditions concerning specific details with respect to matters such as date, location, and quantity provided that such terms and conditions are not inconsistent with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.\nMaxMind reserves the right to reject any purchase order or similar form which, in MaxMind's reasonable judgment, creates any ambiguity concerning which terms are applicable to this Agreement.\n</li>\n<li> This Agreement shall terminate immediately if,
