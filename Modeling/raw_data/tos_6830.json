2022</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>\n<p>This is the Privacy Policy of the Sunsama.com website and any affiliated software and mobile applications (collectively, the \u201cSite\u201d), operated by Summay, Inc.\n(together with our affiliates and subsidiaries, \u201cSummay\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d, \u201cour\u201d and terms of similar meaning) and our related products and services (collectively, the \u201cService\u201d or \u201cServices\u201d).\nIt describes the information that we collect from you as part of the normal operation of our Site, and how we use and disclose this information.\nAll of the different forms of data, content, and information described below are collectively referred to as \u201cinformation.\u201d</p>\n<p>By accepting the Privacy Policy in the registration process or by visiting and using the Site or the Services, you expressly consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nThis Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to our Terms of Service.\nCapitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Terms of Service.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>1.\nThe Information We Collect And Store<p>We may collect and store the following information when running our Service:</p>\n<p>Information You Provide.\n&nbsp;We may collect personal information that can be used to contact or identify you, and may include information such as an individual\u2019s name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, and payment or bank account details (\u201cPersonal Information\u201d).</p>\n<p>When you register an Account, we may collect some Personal Information, such as your name, your name, your phone number, a credit card or other billing information, your email address and postal addresses.\nThe Site allows you to link your Third Party Accounts.\nWe may use OAuth (as defined below), if available, to access Third Party Accounts in order to limit our collection of your passwords.\n\u201cOAuth\u201d is an open protocol for authorization, commonly used a way for users to log in to sites using their accounts with third-party services, such as Google or Microsoft, but without exposing their third-party-service passwords to such sites.\nFor a Third Party Account that does not support OAuth, we will ask for your login credentials for such Third Party Account, which may include your email address and password.\nIn all cases, we may collect your name and email address and the names and email addresses of your email contacts, subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.\nIf you create an Account using your login credentials from one of your Third Party Accounts, we may access and collect your name and email address and other Personal Information that your privacy settings on the Third Party Account permit us to access, subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>When you invite others to join Summay, you provide us with certain contact information that allows us to send an invitation.\nWe may also receive Personal Information through other users, for example if they have tried to give you access to a Summay account or refer Summay to you.\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that your Personal Information is up-to-date.</p>\n<p>Others\u2019 Personal Information.\n&nbsp;If you provide Personal Information about someone else, you must ensure and hereby agree that you are authorized to disclose that information to Summay and that, without Summay taking any further steps required by applicable data protection or privacy laws, Summay may collect, use and disclose such information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nYou must take reasonable steps to ensure that the individual concerned is aware of and consents to the various matters detailed in this Privacy Policy, including the fact that that person\u2019s Personal Information is being collected, the purposes for which that information is being collected, the intended recipients of that information, Summay\u2019s identity, and how to contact Summay.</p>\n<p>Sensitive Personal Information.\nYou are prohibited from uploading any Sensitive Personal Information about yourself or others, as set forth in the Terms of Service.</p>\n<p>Log Data.\n&nbsp.\nWhen you use the Service, we may automatically record information from your Device, its software, and your activity using the Services.\nThis may include the Device\u2019s Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) address, browser type, the web page visited before you came to our website, information you select or search for on our website, locale preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, date and time stamps associated with transactions, system configuration information, metadata concerning your files, and other interactions with the Service.</p>\n<p>Cookies and Tracking Technologies.\n&nbsp.\nWe also use technologies such as cookies, JavaScript, local storage (as defined below), pixel tags and scripts to collect information, provide a better user experience, and improve our Services.\nA cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your Device.\nWe may use \u201cpersistent cookies\u201d to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service.\nWe may use \u201csession ID cookies\u201d to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service.\nYou can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.\nIf you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of the Service.\n\u201cLocal storage\u201d is a way for a website to collect and store information \u201clocally\u201d (e.g., on the user\u2019s device rather than on the website\u2019s server) and then later retrieve it again.\nLocal storage includes \u201clocalStorage\u201d and \u201csessionStorage.\u201d By using local storage, a user\u2019s visits can, for example, be stored on their own computer, counted, and then given to us.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>2.\nHow We Use Personal Information<p>Personal Information.\nPersonal Information is or may be used: (i) to provide and improve our Service, (ii) to administer your use of the Service, (iii) to better understand your needs and interests, (iv) to personalize and improve your experience, and (v) to provide or offer software updates and product announcements.\nIf you no longer wish to receive communications from us, please follow the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d instructions provided in any of those communications, or update your account settings information.</p>\n<p>Analytics.\n&nbsp.\nWe also collect some information (ourselves or using third party services) using logging and cookies, such as IP address, which can sometimes be correlated with Personal Information.\nWe use this information for the above purposes and to monitor and analyze use of the Service, for the Service\u2019s technical administration, to increase our Service\u2019s functionality and user-friendliness, and to verify users have the authorization needed for the Service to process their requests.\nWe may use Highlight and Intercom for these purposes.\nTo learn more about the privacy policy of Highlight, click here.\nTo learn more about the privacy policy of Intercom, click here.</p>\n<p>Google Analytics.\nOur website uses Google Analytics, a service which transmits website traffic data to Google servers in the United States.\nGoogle Analytics does not identify individual users or associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.\nWe use reports provided by Google Analytics to help us understand website traffic and webpage usage.</p>\n<p>Facebook Pixel.\nOur website uses Facebook Pixel, a service which transmits website traffic data to Facebook's servers.\nWe use reports provided by Facebook Pixel to help us understand website traffic and webpage usage.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>3.\nInformation Sharing and Disclosure<p>Your Use.\n&nbsp;User Content that you provide to us may be shared with other Users that are connected to your Account.\nYou can also use the Services to share your User Content with other third parties.\nFor example, your calendar information may be integrated into your Account, and, if you are invited to attend a meeting, or if you invite others to attend a meeting, your meeting notes may automatically be posted to your calendar and so shared with the other meeting attendees (whether or not they are Account holders).\nUnder no circumstances will we sell your Personal Information to third parties.</p>\n<p>Service Providers, Business Partners and Others.\n&nbsp.\nWe may use certain trusted third party companies and individuals to help us provide, analyze, and improve the Service (including but not limited to data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, payment processing, and improvement of the Service\u2019s features).\nThese third parties may have access to your information only for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf and under obligations similar to those in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>Third Party Applications.\n&nbsp.\nWe may share your information with a third party application with your consent, for example when you choose to access our Services through such an application.\nWe are not responsible for what those parties do with your information, so you should make sure you trust the application and that it has a privacy policy acceptable to you.</p>\n<p>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement Requests.\nProtection of Summay's Rights.\n&nbsp.\nWe may disclose to parties outside Summay information that you provide and that we collect when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with a law, regulation or compulsory legal request.\n(b) protect the safety of any person from death or serious bodily injury.\n(c) prevent fraud or abuse of Summay or its users.\nor (d) to protect Summay\u2019s property rights.</p>\n<p>Services's use of information received, and Services's transfer of information to any other app, from Google APIs will adhere to Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use Requirements.\nYou can learn more about how we utilize data from the Gmail API here</p>\n<p>Business Transfers.\n&nbsp.\nIf we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, but we will notify you (for example, via email and/or a prominent notice on our website) of any change in control or use of your information, or if your information becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.\nWe will also notify you of choices you may have regarding the information.</p>\n<p>Non-Private or Non-Personal Information.\n&nbsp.\nWe may disclose your non-private, aggregated, or otherwise non-personal information, such as usage statistics of our Service.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>4.\nChanging or Deleting Your Information<p>You can access and modify the Personal Information associated with your Account by contacting us at support@sunsama.com.\nPlease note that if you signed up using Third Party Account, you may have to access and modify the Personal

account.\nWe may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.\nConsistent with these requirements, we will try to delete your information quickly upon request.\nPlease note, however, that there might be latency in deleting information from our servers and backed-up versions might exist after deletion.\nOnly the User may request that an Account be deleted.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>6.\nSecurity<p>The security of your information is important to us.\nWe follow generally accepted standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.\nNo method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, however.\nTherefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.\nIf you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us at support@sunsama.com.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>7.\nOur Policy Toward Children<p>Our Services are not directed to persons under

to maintain your own backup of your User Content and other data.</p>\n<p>Sections 3 through 26 will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>12.\nIndemnification<p>User will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Summay from and against all liabilities, damages, and costs (including settlement costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of a third party claim, suit, action or proceeding regarding: (i) User Content.\n(ii) User\u2019s use of the Services in violation of these Terms.\n(iii) User\u2019s uploading of Sensitive Personal Information to the Services.\nor (iv) User\u2019s disclosure of or failure to protect the Login Credentials.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>13.\nNo Warranties<p>Though we want to provide a great service, there are certain things about the service we can\u2019t promise.\nFor example, THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED \u201cAS IS\u201d, AT YOUR OWN RISK, WITHOUT EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND.\nWE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.\nSummay will have no responsibility for any harm to your Device, loss or corruption of data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the Services or Software.\nYou are fully responsible for securing and backing up your own User Content and other data.\nSummay does not warrant that the operation of our Services will be error-free or uninterrupted.\nSome states do not allow the types of disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>14.\nLimitation of Liability<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUMMAY, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS) DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT SUMMAY HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.\n(B) AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES MORE THAN THE GREATER OF $20 OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO SUMMAY FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS OF THE SERVICES IN QUESTION.\nSome states do not allow the types of limitations in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>15.\nForce Majeure<p>SUMMAY WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR FAILURE OR DELAY IN PERFORMANCE TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND ITS REASONABLE CONTROL, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ACTS OF GOD, TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURE, OR THEFT OR DESTRUCTION OF OUR SERVICES.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>16.\nConfidential Information<p>User agrees not to use any Confidential Information (as hereinafter defined) disclosed to it by us for its own use or for any purpose other than to use the Services.\nUser shall not disclose or permit disclosure of any Confidential Information to third parties.\nUser agrees that they shall take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure or use of Confidential Information in order to prevent it from falling into the public domain or the possession of persons other than those persons authorized under these Terms to have any such information.\n&nbsp;Such measures shall include the degree of care that User utilizes to protect its own Confidential Information of a similar nature.\n&nbsp;User agrees to notify us of any misuse, misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information which may come to User\u2019s attention.\nIf User becomes legally compelled to disclose any Confidential Information, other than pursuant to a confidentiality agreement, User will provide us prompt written notice of such disclosure and will assist us in seeking a protective order or another appropriate remedy.\n&nbsp;If we waive User\u2019s compliance with this Section or fail to obtain a protective order or other appropriate remedy, User will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed.\nprovided that any Confidential Information so disclosed shall maintain its confidentiality protection for all purposes other than such legally compelled disclosure.</p>\n<p>User agrees that any violation or threatened violation of these provisions related to the use and disclosure of Confidential Information will cause irreparable injury to Summay, entitling Summay to obtain injunctive relief in addition to all legal remedies without showing or proving any actual damage and without any bond being required to be posted.</p>\n<p>\u201cConfidential Information\u201d means any oral, written, graphic or machine-readable information, technical data or know-how, including, but not limited to, that which relates to patents, patent applications, research, product plans, products, developments, inventions, processes, designs, drawings, engineering, formulae, markets, software (including source and object code), computer programs, algorithms, interfaces, inventions, processes, work flows, business plans, agreements with third parties, services, and customers, whether or not designated as \u201cconfidential\u201d at the time of disclosure.\nConfidential Information shall include information disclosed by us before the date User first used our Services, but shall not include information that: (i) was publicly known or made generally available without a duty of confidentiality prior to the time of disclosure to User by us.\n(ii) becomes publicly known or made generally available without a duty of confidentiality after disclosure to User by us through no action or inaction of User.\nor (iii) is in the rightful possession of User without confidentiality obligations at the time of disclosure by us to User as shown by User\u2019s then-contemporaneous written files and records kept in the ordinary course of business.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>17.\nModifications<p>We may revise these Terms from time to time and the most current version will be posted on our Site.\nIf a revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify the User (for example via email to the email address associated with the User\u2019s account).\nOther changes may be posted to our terms page, so please check that page regularly.\nIf a User continues to use the Services after revisions become effective, the User agrees to be bound by the revised Terms.\nIf you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Services.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>18.\nAssignment<p>You may not assign any of your rights in these Terms, and any such attempt is void.\nSummay may assign its rights, with or without notice to you, to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>19.\nResolving Disputes<p>Customer service is a priority, but if there\u2019s an issue that needs to be resolved, this section outlines what is expected of both of us.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>A.\nInitial Informal Dispute Resolution.\nBefore filing a claim against Summay, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us via email at support@sunsama.com.\nWe will try to resolve the dispute by contacting you via email.\nIf a dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days of submission, you or Summay may bring a formal proceeding.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>B.\nArbitration Agreement.\nYou and Summay agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or the Services, whether or not such claims involve a third party, through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\nThis arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Summay.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>C.\nArbitration Notification.\nIf either of us intends to seek arbitration under this agreement, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the dispute in writing at least thirty (30) days in advance of initiating the arbitration.\nNotice to Summay should be sent to us via email to support@sunsama.com, with a duplicate copy sent via registered mail, return receipt requested, to the mailing address specified on our Site.\nThe notice must describe the nature and basis of the claim and the relief being sought.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>D.\nArbitration Procedures.\nYou may bring claims only on your own behalf.\nThe American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.\nThe arbitration will be held in San Francisco California, or any other location we agree to.</p>\n<p>In the event that the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one (1) year of filing the case, then either Summay or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services.</p>\n<p>Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction.\nAny provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies, or awards that conflict with these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>E.\nArbitration Fees.\nThe AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>F.\nExceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.\nEither party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.</p>\n<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate, but to opt out, you must notify Summay in writing within thirty (30) days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision.\nYou must provide notice to us via email to support@sunsama.com, with a duplicate copy sent via registered mail, return receipt requested, to the mailing address specified on our Site.\nYou must include your name and address, the primary contact and account administrator\u2019s name and address, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND SUMMAY AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL.\nYou and Summay unconditionally waive any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or relating to this agreement in any way.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>G.\nProhibition of Class Arbitrations.\nYOU MAY ONLY RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH US ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND MAY NOT BRING A CLAIM AS A PLAINTIFF OR A CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nClass arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.\nThis agreement does not allow class or collective arbitrations even if the AAA procedures or rules would allow them.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, the arbitrator shall not have the power to determine that class arbitration is permissible.\nThe arbitrator also shall not have the power to preside over class or collective arbitration, or to award any form of class-wide or collective remedy.</p>\n<p>If for any reason the prohibition of class arbitrations set forth above cannot be enforced, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>H.\nJudicial Forum for Disputes.\nIN THE EVENT THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IS FOUND NOT TO APPLY TO YOU OR YOUR CLAIM, YOU AND SUMMAY AGREE THAT ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE MUST BE LITIGATED EXCLUSIVELY IN THE FEDERAL OR STATE COURTS OF SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA.\nBOTH YOU AND SUMMAY CONSENT TO VENUE AND PERSONAL JURISDICTION THERE.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>20.\nControlling Law<p>THESE TERMS AND THE USE OF THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE WILL BE GOVERNED BY CALIFORNIA LAW EXCEPT FOR ITS CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES.\nThese Terms will not be governed by the United Nations Conventions on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, if otherwise applicable.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>21.\nEntire Agreement<p>These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between you and Summay with respect to the Services, and supersede and replace any other agreements, terms and conditions applicable to the Services.\nThese Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>22.\nNotice<p>We may send you, in electronic form, information about our Services, additional information, and information the law requires us to provide.\nWe may provide required information to you by email at the address you specified when you signed up for our Services or by access to a website that we identify.\nNotices emailed to you will be deemed given and received when the email is sent.\nIf you don\u2019t consent to receive notices electronically, you must stop using our Services.\nYou must provide legal notice to us via email to support@sunsama.com, with a duplicate copy sent via registered mail, return receipt requested, to the mailing address specified on our Site.\nAny such notice, in either case, must specifically reference that it is a notice given under these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>23.\nSeverability<p>These Terms apply to the maximum extent permitted by relevant law.\nIf a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>24.\nTime Limitation on Claims<p>Claims must be filed within one year.\nYou must bring any claim related to these Terms or our Services within one year of the date you could first bring the claim, unless your local law requires a longer time to file claims.\nIf it is not filed in time, the claim is permanently barred.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>25.\nWaiver<p>Summay\u2019s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>26.\nRelationship<p>Summay and you are not legal partners or agents.\ninstead, our relationship is that of independent contractors.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>\u200d", "created_at": "2022-11-12 00:47:33.951682", "updated_at": "2022-11-12 00:48:26.686979"}], "points": [], "urls": ["sunsama.com"]}}
