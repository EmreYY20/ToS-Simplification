based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms.\nAny dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement will be resolved by the arbitrator.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE

through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available.\n(c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration.\nor (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</li>\n<li>Opt-Out.\nIf you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 24(C) within

of arbitration] (\u201c<strong>Opt-Out Notice</strong>\u201d).\nOnce Kidadl receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 24(C) will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 21.\nThe remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.</li>\n<li>Arbitrator.\nThis arbitration agreement, and any arbitration between us, is subject the Federal Arbitration Act and will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201c<strong>AAA</strong>\u201d) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, \u201c<strong>AAA Rules</strong>\u201d) as modified by these Terms.\nThe AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Kidadl.\n&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Commencing Arbitration.\nBefore initiating arbitration, a party must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S.\nMail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (\u201c<strong>Notice of Arbitration</strong>\u201d).\nKidadl\u2019s address for Notice is: Kidadl Limited, The Stable Yard Vicarage Road, Stony Stratford, Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England, MK11 1BN.\nThe Notice of Arbitration must: (a) identify the name or account number of the party making the claim.\n(b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\u201c<strong>Demand</strong>\u201d).\nThe parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Kidadl may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nIf you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Kidadl will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000 or if Kidadl has received 25 or more similar demands for arbitration, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.\nIf the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules and the other party may seek reimbursement for any fees paid to AAA.</li>\n<li>Arbitration Proceedings.\nAny arbitration hearing will take place in the county and state of your residence address unless we agree otherwise or, if the claim is for US$10,000 or less (and does not seek injunctive relief), you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(b) through a telephonic or video hearing.\nor (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the Jams rules in the county (or parish) of your residence/billing address.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Kidadl must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Arbitration Relief.\nExcept as provided in Section 24(C)8, the arbitrator can award any relief that would be available if the claims had been brought in a court of competent jurisdiction.\nIf the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Kidadl before an arbitrator was selected, Kidadl will pay to you the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (b) US$10,000.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award shall be final and binding on all parties.\nJudgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</li>\n<li>No Class Actions.\nYOU AND KIDADL AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nFurther, unless both you and Kidadl agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\n&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.\nIf Kidadl makes any substantive change to this arbitration provision, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Kidadl\u2019s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Kidadl will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.</li>\n<li>Enforceability.\nIf Section 24(C)8 or the entirety of this Section 24(C) is found to be unenforceable, or if Kidadl receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 24(C) will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 21 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>25.\nADDITIONAL DISCLAIMERS.\nTHE WEBSITE,
