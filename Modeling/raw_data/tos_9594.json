using the Stripe services to accept payment for goods or services from a customer, and the Connected Account Agreement does not apply to you.\nPlease review the Recipient Info section below for more

service.\nStripe will facilitate the transfer of funds to you based on instructions given to Stripe by the Connect Platform.\nYou may have a separate agreement with a Connect Platform for the Connect Platform to pay you for goods or services.\nPlease contact the Connect Platform with any questions about the status of any funds the Connect Platform has sent to you.</p>\n<p>As part of Stripe Connect, Stripe may separately offer you the ability to access an information portal managed by Stripe in order for you to see the status of payments from a Connect Platform.\nThe portal terms apply to you when you access the portal.</p>Stripe Connected Account Agreement<p>This Stripe Connected Account Agreement (\u201cConnected Account Agreement\u201d) is an agreement between Stripe and you, being the person or legal entity (including sole proprietors) identified to Stripe as the owner of the Stripe Account that is to be integrated with third-party platform providers that use Stripe Connect (\u201cConnect Platforms\u201d).\nYou expressly agree to the terms and conditions of this Connected Account Agreement, the&nbsp;Stripe Services Agreement, and any updates or modifications to either of those documents made from time to time by Stripe.</p>\n<p>We use a number of defined terms in this Connected Account Agreement.\nThe products and services that you receive from a Connect Platform, regardless of whether or not fees are charged, are referred to as \u201cPlatform Services\u201d.\nExamples of Platform Services that a Connect Platform may agree to provide are web development or hosting services, customer service, processing of refunds, and the handling of consumer complaints.\nYour agreement with a Connect Platform for the provision of the Platform Services is

access is made available to you, you are responsible for all actions taken on your Stripe Account through the Stripe dashboard, including the initiation of Refunds or changing of depository bank information.</p>\n<p>Depending on your location, a Connect Platform may allow you to receive payment processing proceeds via settlement into a bank account connected to your debit card (\u201cInstant
