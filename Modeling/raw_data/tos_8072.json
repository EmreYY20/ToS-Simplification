general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Will MM ever change the Services?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We're always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time.\nWe may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services.\nWe'll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn't always practical.\nSimilarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Does MM cost anything?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>While you may use some of our Services for free by enrolling in the Free Plan, if you choose to enroll in our Premium (the \"Paid Plan\"), you will be charged a subscription fee.\nThe subscription fee for these Services (\"Subscription Fee\") will be charged to you in advance, to the credit card you provided upon enrollment in the Paid Plan.\nSubscription Fees are non-refundable.\nYour enrollment in the Paid Plan will be automatically renewed every twelve (12) months.\nMM will notify you prior to the expiration of the twelve (12) month Paid Plan term.\nif you wish to cancel auto-renewal of the Paid Plan for the following year, you must notify MM within 3 days of your receipt of an auto-renewal notice from MM.\nMM may change the Subscription Fee upon notice to you, but such change will only take effect once your then-current Paid Plan term has ended.\nIf you do not wish to pay the new Subscription Fee, your only remedy shall be to cancel your enrollment in the Paid Plan for the following year, prior to the expiration of your then-current Paid Plan term.\nYou may cancel your Paid Plan subscription at any time, but again, no refunds will be granted for Subscription Fees paid.</p>\n<p>Though many of our Services are currently free, MM reserves the right to require payment of fees for certain or all Services.\nYou shall pay all applicable fees, as described on the Website in connection with such Services selected by you.\nMM reserves the right to change its price list and to institute new charges at any time, upon notice to you, which may be sent by email or posted on the Website.\nYour use of the Services following such notification constitutes your acceptance of any new or increased charges.</p>\n<p>Any free trial or other promotion that provides access to a Paid Plan must be used within the specified time of the trial.\nYou must stop using a Paid Plan before the end of the trial period in order to avoid being charged for that Paid Plan.\nIf you cancel prior to the end of the trial period and are inadvertently charged for a Paid Plan, please contact us at

restrictions set forth in these Terms.</p>\n<p>Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account.\nWe will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account so that you are able to retrieve any important User Submissions you may have stored in your account (to the extent allowed by law and these Terms), but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone's safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the rights or property of MM.</p>\n<p>If you have deleted your account by mistake, contact us immediately at support@monarchmoney.com \u2013 we will try to help, but unfortunately, we can't promise that we can

us.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>I use the MM App available via the Apple App Store \u2013 should I know anything about that?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>These Terms apply to your use of all the Services, including the
