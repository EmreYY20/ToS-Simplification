2023</em>\n</p>\n<p>\nOur mission is to simplify complex financial information and decisions so that our readers have the confidence to manage every aspect of their financial life.\nYour financial life is filled with personal decisions and challenges.\nWhether you are investing as a beginner or expert, planning your retirement, buying a home, studying for an exam in business school, or running a small business you have questions that need answering.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor over 20 years, we\u2019ve helped hundreds of millions of people do just that.\nWe feel it\u2019s important to share how we go about writing all of the articles that you depend on.\n</p>\n<p>At Investopedia we aspire to provide the highest quality content produced by humans, for humans.\nIt is against our guidelines to publish automatically generated content using AI (artificial intelligence) writing tools such as ChatGPT.</p> Principles <p>\n<strong>Empowering: </strong>Finance can be complex and intimidating.\nWe provide you with information that you can use with confidence, whatever your level of experience.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Unbiased: </strong>From financial product recommendations to the financial implications of government policy we put things in context and provide all the facts.\nOur information is carefully researched and is not written to support any specific economic or political viewpoint.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Accurate: </strong>Having accurate financial information, presented clearly and updated regularly is of the utmost importance to us.\nWe seek out and work with the most qualified experts across every topic we cover.\nAny mistakes, inaccuracies or misrepresentations identified by our readers are investigated and corrected promptly.\nPlease contact us for corrections.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Inclusive: </strong>We work to ensure that our content serves\u2014and depicts with dignity and respect\u2014people of different ages, nationalities, religions, gender identities, sexual orientations, ethnicities, relationship statuses, physical and mental abilities, and family types.\n</p> Ethics <p>\nWe are committed to following the Codes of Ethics of the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing (SABEW).\nOur content is guided by and upholds the Society for Professional Journalists\u2019 foundations of ethical journalism: being accurate and fair, minimizing harm, acting independently, and being accountable and transparent.\nWe also uphold the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines on disclosures, where applicable.\n</p>\n<p>\nInvestopedia content is for informational purposes and is not intended to substitute for the advice of a licensed or certified attorney, accountant, financial advisor, or other certified financial professionals.\n</p> Editorial Process <p>\nOur staff of editors and network of expert contributors write and manage all the articles you find on Investopedia.\nWe don\u2019t make recommendations for you to buy, sell, or hold securities or investments.\nWe do, however, provide relevant analysis, context, insights, and educational information to help you make smarter, better-informed decisions.\nWherever possible we provide examples that help put complex topics and concepts into perspective.\n</p>\n<p>\nOur editorial team is continually evaluating the articles across our site to flag any that contain information that is known to be or is likely to be out-of-date.\nSuch articles are reviewed and updated or, if necessary, completely rewritten, rechecked, and re-edited.\nOur network of experienced experts, who uphold our process and policies, assist with our updating efforts.\nArticles that have been updated are date-stamped to reflect this.\n</p> Quality Standards <p>\nEvery article you see has multiple people behind it, continually working to make sure that it is responsible, accurate, understandable, helpful, and reflective of our editorial principles.\n</p>\n<p>\nOur editorial team approves all story ideas independently, and our expert contributors each have deep subject matter expertise in the topics that we assign them.\nOur team of professional editors, fact checkers, and producers review content to ensure it upholds our values of being empowering, inclusive, unbiased, and accurate.\n</p>\n<p>\nAll staff are responsible for disclosing any potential conflicts of interest.\n</p> Corrections <p>\nInvestopedia is committed to telling readers when an error has appeared, and to correcting it.\nThis transparency applies to small and large mistakes, including news, but only if an error was made at the time of original publication.\nCorrections will be clearly noted on the page.\nWhen our journalism is factually correct, but the language is not as clear or detailed as necessary, the story may be updated without an editor's note.&nbsp;Please report possible errors to inv_editorial@investopedia.com.&nbsp.\n</p> Writers <p>\nInvestopedia experts are carefully recruited, vetted, and chosen.\nSome are experienced financial writers, others are experts in particular aspects of finance.\nmany are both.\nThey are selected for their knowledge and their skill at communicating complex topics in clear, accessible, actionable language.\n</p>\n<p>\nEvery article\u2019s author or reviewer is listed at the top of the page, to the left of the date, and is linked to their biography, which you can click on to learn more about their credentials, education, professional experience, and social media presence.\n</p>\n<p>\nAll writers are required to uphold the editorial guidelines listed above.\n</p> Third-Party Content <p>\nThird-party content is carefully reviewed by the Investopedia editorial team to ensure that it is aligned with our policies and standards.\nAny such content is labeled clearly and conspicuously to notify you of its source.\n</p> Warranty and Liability Disclaimer <p>\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only and should not be considered individual investment advice or recommendations to invest in any security or adopt any investment strategy.\nThough we believe the information provided herein is reliable, we do not warrant its accuracy or completeness.\nThe views and strategies described in our content may not be suitable for all investors.\nBecause market and economic conditions are subject to rapid change, all comments, opinions, and analyses contained within our content are rendered as of the date of the posting and may change without notice.\nThe material is not intended as a complete analysis of every material fact regarding any country, region, market, industry, investment, or strategy.\n</p>\n<p>\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (\u201cICOs\u201d) is highly risky and speculative, and cryptocurrency-related content on Investopedia is not a recommendation to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.\nSince each individual's situation is unique, a qualified professional should always be consulted before making any financial decisions.\nInvestopedia makes no representations or warranties as to the accuracy or timeliness of the information contained herein.<br>\n</p> Advertising Disclosure <p>\n<em>Updated June 12, 2020</em>\n</p>\n<p>\nInvestopedia accepts advertising, but maintains a strict and clear separation between advertising and editorial content.\nSpecial attention is paid to featuring advertising in a way that will not interfere with your reading experience.\nThis relates to both page design and to the number of ads we choose to feature on a page.\n</p>\n<p>\nInvestopedia maintains a distinct separation between advertising and editorial content.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All advertising or sponsored content on Investopedia is clearly and unambiguously distinguished from editorial content through borders or other distinguishing elements and/or identified as an \"Ad,\" \"Advertisement,\" \"Sponsored\" or a similar designation indicating that the content is being provided by or on behalf of the sponsor.</li>\n<li>All ads on Investopedia are labeled as an \"Ad,\" \"Advertisement,\" \"Sponsored\" or a similar designation indicating that the content is being provided by or on behalf of the sponsor.</li>\n<li>All \"native\" ads or paid content are identified as an \"Ad,\" \"Advertisement,\" \"Sponsored\" or a similar designation indicating that the content is being provided by or on behalf of the sponsor.</li>\n<li>Editorial content on Investopedia is not influenced by advertisements unless the content is sponsored content, in which case, the content will be clearly demarcated and identified with the title \"Ad,\" \"Advertisement,\" or \"Sponsored\", or a similar designation, indicating that the content is being provided by or on behalf of an advertiser or sponsor.</li>\n<li>In some cases, editorial may include links to partners for which Investopedia receives an affiliate commission (See \u2018How We Make Money\u2019 for more details).\nThe placement of these links is not influenced by payment, and editorial reserves the right to change, modify or remove them at any time in order to provide the best experience to users.</li>\n</ul> How We Make Money <p>\nThe way that we're able to offer over 30,000 articles of great content on our website for free is by partnering with advertisers and affiliate partners who are looking to reach consumers.\nThis can take a number of different forms, and we'll walk through those below.\nIt's important to note that we maintain strict editorial independence for all of our content, particularly on reviews and recommendations.\nIf a product is great, we'll tell you even if we don't have an advertising relationship.\nIf we think a product is bad, we'll tell you that, even if we DO have an advertising relationship with them.\nWhile we do recommend and review products regardless of any advertising relationships, we may not have reviewed every product available in a given category.\n</p> Affiliate Links to Advertisers <p>\nIn some cases we may have an affiliate relationship with a product that we review, and so when you click on an \"Open Account\" button or sometimes a hyperlink on the product's name in those cases we may receive compensation either when you click on it it or if you decide to sign up for the product.\nWhether or not we have an advertiser in place does not change the placement of the button or whether there's a link for you to go to their website.\n</p> Example of a broker review with a product card featuring an Open Account button, for which we may receive compensation when you click it or if you sign up for the product.\nComparison/Rate Tables Featuring Advertisers <p>\nOn some review/recommendations we may include a comparison table of products that are offers from advertisers.\nWhile we do work hard with partners to try and surface the best paid offers possible in these comparison tables, it's important to note that they are NOT editorially selected.\nHere's an example of what that can look like, notice the Advertising Disclosure link in the top right corner:\n</p> Comparison tables featuring advertisers will always have their own Advertising Disclosure on them.\nDisplay Ads <p>\nSome review/recommendations may include display advertising on them, which will be labelled as advertisements and are easily recognized.\n</p> Example of traditional display advertisements on a bank review.\nPrivacy Policy <p>\n<em>Updated September 27, 2021</em>\n</p>\n<p>\nAt Investopedia, we take online privacy seriously and we respect the concerns of our community of

permitted by applicable law, or as directed by you, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe do not knowingly \"sell\" personal information that we collect from you, in accordance with the definition of \"sell\" in the CCPA, and will treat personal information we collect from you as subject to a do not sell request.\nThere is not yet a consensus as to whether third-party cookies and tracking devices associated with our websites and mobile apps may constitute a \"sale\" of your PI as defined by the CCPA.\nYou can exercise control over browser-based cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser.\nWe also list cookies and provide access to their privacy information and, if available, opt-out programs in our Cookie Policy.\nFurther, you can learn more about your choices regarding certain kinds of online interest-based advertising with the Digital Advertising Alliance or the Network Advertising Initiative.\nWe do not represent that these third-party tools, programs or statements are complete or accurate.\n</p>\n<p>\nSome browsers have signals that may be characterized as do not track signals, but we do not understand them to operate in that manner or to indicate a do not sell expression by you, so we currently do not recognize these as a do not sell request.\nWe understand that various parties are developing do not sell signals and we may recognize certain such signals if we conclude such a program is appropriate.\n</p>\n<p>\nCalifornia Consumers have the right to exercise the privacy rights under the CCPA.\nCalifornia Consumers may exercise these rights via an authorized agent who meets the agency requirements of the CCPA.\nAny request you submit to us is subject to an identification and residency verification process (\"<strong>Verifiable Consumer Request</strong>\").\nWe will not fulfill your CCPA request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we collected PI.\nIn order to verify your identity, we will send you an email to the email address that you provide to us, and you must take action as described in our email.\nThis will enable us to verify that the person who made the request controls and has access to the email address associated with the request.\nWe will check our systems for the email address that you provide, and any information associated with such email address.\nIf you provide us with an email address that has not been used to interact with us, then we will not be able to verify your identity.\nIn other words, the only reasonable method by which we may verify the identity of individuals is if we have an email address on file that was provided to us in relation to our services.\nWe will be unable to fulfill your request if we cannot verify your identity.\n<strong>Please follow the instructions at our Consumer Rights Request page here</strong> and respond to any follow up inquiries we may make.\n</p>\n<p>\nSome personal information we maintain about Consumers is not sufficiently associated with enough personal information about the Consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular Consumer's personal information (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID).\nAs required by the CCPA, we do not include that personal information in response to Verifiable Consumer Requests.\nIf we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify Consumer PI that we collect, process, store, disclose, and otherwise use and to respond to your California Consumer privacy rights requests.\nWe will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests, but we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>To make a request according to your rights to know or to request deletion of your PI set forth below, please click here</strong>, where you will find a description of the process we use to verify your request and any information that we will need to confirm your identity.\nIn order to verify your identity, we will send you an email to the email address that you provide to us, and you must take action as described in our email.\nThis will enable us to verify that the person who made the request controls and has access to the email address associated with the request.\nWe will check our systems for the email address that you provide, and any information associated with such email address.\nIf you provide us with an email address that has not been used to interact with us, then we will not be able to verify your identity.\nIn other words, the only reasonable method by which we may verify the identity of individuals is if we have an email address on file that was provided to us in relation to our services.\nWe will be unable to fulfill your request if we cannot verify your identity.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor your specific pieces of information, as required by the CCPA, we will apply heightened verification standards, which may include a request to provide further information.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou have the right to send us a request, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, for any of the following for the period that is twelve months prior to the request date:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The categories of PI we have collected about you.</li>\n<li>The categories of sources from which we collected your PI.</li>\n<li>The business or commercial purposes for our collecting or selling your PI.</li>\n<li>The categories of third parties to whom we have shared your PI.</li>\n<li>The specific pieces of PI we have collected about you.</li>\n<li>A list of the categories of PI disclosed for a business purpose in the prior 12 months, or that no disclosure occurred.</li>\n<li>A list of the categories of PI sold about you in the prior 12 months, or that no sale occurred.\nIf we sold your PI, we will explain:The categories of your PI we have sold.</li>\n<li>The categories of third parties to which we sold PI, by categories of PI sold for each third party.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nYou have the right to make or obtain a transportable copy, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, of your PI that we have collected in the period that is 12 months prior to the request date and are maintaining.\n</p>\n<p>\nPlease note that PI is retained by us for various time periods, so we may not be able to fully respond to what might be relevant going back 12 months prior to the request.\n</p>\n<p>\nExcept to the extent we have a basis for retention under CCPA, you may request that we delete your PI that we have collected directly from you and are maintaining.\nNote also that we are not required to delete your PI that we did not collect directly from you.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou may alternatively exercise more limited control of your PI by instead exercising one of the following more limited opt-outs, including unsubscribing from email newsletters.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe will not discriminate against you in a manner prohibited by the CCPA because you exercise your CCPA rights.\nHowever, we may charge a different price or rate, or offer a different level or quality of good or service, to the extent that doing so is reasonably related to the value of the applicable data.\nIn addition, we may offer you financial incentives for the collection, sale and retention and use of your PI as permitted by the CCPA that can, without limitation, result in reasonably different prices, rates, or quality levels.\nThe material aspects of any financial incentive will be explained and described in its program terms.\nPlease note that participating in incentive programs is entirely optional, you will have to affirmatively opt-in to the program and you can opt-out of each program (i.e., terminate participation and forgo the ongoing incentives) prospectively by following the instructions in the applicable program description and terms.\nWe may add or change incentive programs and/or their terms by posting notice on the program descriptions and terms linked to above so check them regularly.\n</p> Our Notice to Nevada Residents <p>\nUnder Nevada law, Nevada residents may opt out of the sale of certain \u201ccovered information\u201d
