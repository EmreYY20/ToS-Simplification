data.\nUser Information that we collect includes, but is not limited to, Information about a User\u2019s device and operating system, IP address, the web pages accessed by Users within our Customers\u2019 websites, the link that led a User to a Customer\u2019s website, the dates and times a User accesses a Customers\u2019 website, event information (e.g., system crashes), general location information (e.g., city and state), hashed email addresses (when made available by the User), and gender (when made available by the User).\nIn the Taboola News suite of tools, we also collect in-app User behaviors (e.g.\nonline status, browsing activity, and clicks) and implicit non-precise device location inferred from search queries (when enabled by the User).\nWe ask our Customers to obtain consent on our behalf, where required by applicable data protection laws, for us to collect this User Information.\nWe may also obtain Information about you from our&nbsp;data

following purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>\n<strong>Providing our Service</strong>\n</em>.\nWe may use User Information to provide our Services to Users and our Customers.</li>\n<li>\n<em>\n<strong>Tailoring content</strong>\n</em>.\nWe may use User Information to&nbsp;tailor the content and information that we may send or display to Users.\nto retarget content to Users through our Services and elsewhere.\nand to otherwise personalize your experiences while using our Services.\nFor more information about how we tailor our content see information below about our&nbsp;Interest Based Advertising.</li>\n<li>\n<em>\n<strong>Tailoring content across multiple devices</strong>\n</em>.\nWe may use User Information to improve a unique User\u2019s experience across multiple browsers and devices (such as smartphones, tablets, or other viewing devices) by providing better targeted ad campaigns to that User.\nFor instance, should we recognize a User on a web browser, we may want to provide that User similar or personalized content on mobile apps, as well.\nTo do this, we identify unique Users across devices, or we may sync cookies and identifiers with our service providers or Customers that do this, to help our Customers enhance their own data and data segments, or to help them target the right audience.</li>\n<li>\n<em>\n<strong>Offering our Customers data segments that help target content and advertisements for topics, products, and services that may interest you.</strong>\n</em>&nbsp;A data segment is a grouping of users who share one or more attributes (e.g., travel enthusiasts).\nWe offer a number of data segments, both proprietary and from our&nbsp;data partners, to our Customers so that they may better target Users who are more likely to be interested in their content and advertisements.\nTaboola does not knowingly create segments that are based upon what we consider to be sensitive information (for example, Personal Data revealing your racial or ethnic origin or your religious affiliations, or Personal Data concerning your sensitive health information, sex life or sexual orientation, or genetic or biometric data).\nIn connection with our Services, our Customers may use these standard health-related segments about non-sensitive conditions such as an inferred interest in health and wellness or over the counter medications.\nIn addition, Taboola offers our Customers standard political-related segments that may indicate general political sentiment, interest in specific political issues, and political party affiliation.</li>\n</ul> 2.3 How We Disclose User Information <p>We may disclose User Information as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>\n<strong>Taboola

(e.g., maintenance, data analysis, customer relationship management, email marketing, surveys, credit card processing, data hosting, or fraud detection) on our behalf.</li>\n<li>\n<em>\n<strong>Unaffiliated third parties</strong>\n</em>.\nWe may disclose User Information to other unaffiliated third parties, specifically with (i) our&nbsp;data partners, so that we can connect you with relevant content by allowing our advertisers to target specific audience segments, and (ii) our&nbsp;programmatic demand and supply partners, so that we can serve you with tailored advertisements.</li>\n<li>\n<em>\n<strong>Customers</strong>\n</em>.\nWe may disclose User Information to Customers where relevant to the Service we provide those Customers.\nFor example, we may provide publishers with information about the viewing and click-through patterns of the content they publish and may provide advertisers with information about conversion rates for analytics purposes.</li>\n</ul> 2.4 Accessing Your User Information From Taboola <p>You have the right to request that Taboola provide you with access to the Personal Data we hold about you, correct your

Services, including our Services on Customer websites, we may provide advertisements to you based on your recent browsing behavior across different Customer websites, browsers, or devices.\nFor example, if on a first online visit, you browse on website A, then on a subsequent visit to website B, you may see content personalized based on your browsing history on website A.\nFor example, if a user visits a clothing retail site, she might see clothing-related ads on another site she visits.</p>\n<p>In order to target advertisements to you for products and services that may interest you, we may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), HTML5 local storage, and other technologies.\nFor more information about how we use these technologies, please refer to our&nbsp;Cookie Policy.</p>\n<p>We may also work with third parties such as ad networks, which are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to websites that you have visited in the past.\nThese advertisers will deliver you targeted advertisements for products and services that may interest you.\nThird-party ad networks, our advertiser Customers (and their content providers and agents), and/or traffic measurement services may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs, and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you.\nThese&nbsp;third-party cookies and other technologies&nbsp;are governed by each third party\u2019s specific privacy policy, not this one.</p>\n<p>If you have questions about our collection and use of data for interest-based advertising purposes, please contact us at:&nbsp;support@taboola.com.</p> 2.6 User Choices and Opting Out <p>Taboola supports initiatives to offer our Users greater transparency and control over the uses of their Information.\nTherefore, we offer the following options for controlling the interest-based content and ads you receive.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>\n<strong>If&nbsp;</strong>\n</em>&nbsp;<em>\n<strong>you do not want to receive interest-based ads from Taboola, you can disable the display of such ads by clicking on the opt-out link below</strong>\n</em>.\nPlease note that an opt out will not prevent you from seeing Taboola\u2019s content recommendations.\nRather, the opt out will prevent Taboola from using your Information to tailor these recommendations to your interests.\nYou will continue to receive recommendations that are selected based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads).\nYou are currently: Opted Out Opt In Not Opted Out Opt Out <ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Not Opted Out</strong>: Taboola will serve you personalized recommendations based on your history.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Opted Out</strong>: You have opted out of tracking, Taboola will no longer serve you with personalized content recommendations based on your Internet use history.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please also note:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Because our tracking mechanisms operate at the device and browser level, to fully opt-out across devices, you will need to do so on each device and browser individually.<br>\nIf your browsers are configured to reject cookies, your opt-out may not be effective, since we identify your choice to opt-out based on an opt-out cookie we deliver to you.\nIn this case, you will need to confirm that your browser is configured properly in order for the opt-out to be effective.\nIf you are using a Safari browser on iOS11 or macOS High Sierra, you must first adjust your Privacy and Security Settings to turn off both \u201cPrevent Cross-Site Tracking\u201d and \u201cBlock All Cookies\u201d, and then return to this privacy policy or your preferred opt out platform to reset your opt out preferences.</li>\n<li>Taboola may use non-cookie technologies in limited cases.\nLike cookies, these technologies allow Taboola to recommend ads that are tailored to your interests and to remember whether you have chosen to opt-out from our Services.\nPlease note that some web browsers may not permit you to block the use of non-cookie technologies, but you can do so by simply clicking on the Opt Out feature above in this Section 2.6.</li>\n<li>\n<em>\n<strong>You can also opt-out of receiving targeted ads served by Taboola and other advertising companies</strong>\n</em>.\n<ul>\n<li>You may use the&nbsp;NAI opt out tool, which will allow you to opt out of receiving targeted ads from Taboola and from other NAI-approved member

targeted content or ads to you.\nYou may continue to receive advertisements that are selected based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads).</p>\n<p>Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit the DAA, DAAC or EDAA consumer choice pages, your opt out may not be effective because your browser will refuse opt-out cookies (that alert companies that you have exercised your opt-out preference).</p>\n</li>\n</ul> 2.7 Data Retention <p>We retain User Information, which is directly collected for purposes of serving ads, for at most thirteen (13) months from the User\u2019s last interaction with our Services (often for a shorter period of time), after which time we de-identify the data by removing unique identifiers or aggregating the data.</p>\n<p>We retain deidentified or aggregated data, which cannot identify an individual or device and is used for purposes of reporting and analysis, for as long as commercially necessary.\nWe keep opt-out information for longer than this period so that we can continue to honor your opt-out requests.</p> 2.8 Children <p>We do not knowingly collect any data or target any advertisements&nbsp;on websites directed to children under the age of sixteen (16).\nIf you are the parent or guardian of a child under the age of sixteen (16) and have a concern regarding the

Third-Party Online Advertising <p>To understand your interests and deliver advertisements that are tailored to your interests, we may work with&nbsp;service providers or&nbsp;third parties that use their own&nbsp;cookies, web beacons, and other technologies&nbsp;to collect Information about Site Visitors\u2019 online activities, either on our Sites and/or other websites across the Internet &nbsp;(\u201c<b>\n<strong>Taboola Ad Partners</strong>\n</b>\u201d).\nThese Taboola Ad Partners include advertisers and ad networks that may collect Information about when you view or interact with one of their advertisements and may collect information regarding your activities on our Sites and your online activities over time and across different websites.\nLike most advertisers, Taboola works to place our advertisements where we think they will be most interesting and relevant to the recipient.\nOne way we do this is by allowing ad networks to place their own cookies when an individual visits our Sites.\nThis enables the ad network to recognize individuals who have previously visited the Taboola Sites.\nThen, if the ad network has purchased ad space on a third-party website, and recognizes that same individual visiting that third-party website, the ad network can deliver a Taboola advertisement, knowing that this individual has already expressed interest in Taboola by visiting the Taboola Sites.\nTo learn more about third parties who collect Site Visitor Information, please review our&nbsp;Cookie Policy.</p> 3.5 Site Visitor Choices <p>Site Visitors may opt out of the Taboola Ad Partners that collect information on the Sites to serve ads about Taboola.\n(California Site Visitors may exercise their options directly with Taboola, as outlined below in Section

Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data\n<p>If you are a Customer, Site Visitor, or User from the EEA or UK, our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described above (also referred to in this Section 5.1 as \u201c<strong>EEA/UK Data</strong>\u201d) will depend on the&nbsp;Personal Data&nbsp;concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>\n<p>However, we will normally collect Personal Data from you only (i) where we have your consent to do so, (ii) where we need the Personal Data to perform a contract with you, or (iii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.\nIn some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you or may otherwise need the Personal Data to protect your vital interests or those of another person.</p>\n<p>If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Data).</p>\n<p>Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the

and Taboola stores Customer, User, and Visitor information in our data centers located in Israel and the United States.</p>\n<p>When Taboola transfers EEA/UK Data to Taboola.com Ltd.\nin Israel, it relies (as applicable) on (i) the European Commission\u2019s decision, and (ii) UK adequacy regulations that Israel provides a level of data protection that is adequate for EEA/UK Data.\nThese allow the free transfer of EEA/UK Data to Israel without the need for additional data transfer mechanisms.</p>\n<p>Similarly, when Taboola transfers any personal data from the EEA to Taboola Europe Limited in the United Kingdom, it relies on the European Commission\u2019s decision that the UK provides a level of data protection that is adequate for personal data from the EEA.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, when Taboola transfers EEA/UK Data to other countries then, if those countries do not have a European Commission adequacy finding and are not the subject of UK adequacy regulations (as applicable), Taboola implements Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission and/or competent UK authorities (as applicable) to protect the transferred data.\nThe Standard Contractual Clauses are contractual privacy and security commitments that are entered between companies that transfer personal data outside of the EEA.</p>\n<p>In particular, non-EEA/UK Taboola Affiliates, like Taboola, Inc.\nin the United States, have accordingly adopted Standard Contractual Clauses to ensure the legality, privacy, and security of the data flows necessary to provide, maintain, and develop our services.</p> 5.2 Notice to Individuals in the State of California 5.2.1 Your Rights to Your Personal Information\n<p>California residents have the right to request that Taboola (i) provide you with

some limited circumstances, your hashed email address.</p>\n5.2.3 Why Taboola Collects your Personal Information\n<p>Taboola processes your Personal Information in order to provide personalized

withdrawal (this includes the tail payment owed for the amount spend below the established increment).\nIn addition to any other rights or remedies that Taboola may have, Advertiser\u2019s failure to

pay all reasonable expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) incurred by Taboola in collecting such payments.\nUpon the conclusion of each calendar month that the Campaign is running on the Taboola Network (each a \u201cCampaign Month\u201d), the Analytics Dashboard will provide Advertiser with details regarding the amount of Clicks on Advertiser\u2019s Content and the amount of the Prepayment,

waives such objections and such invoice will be deemed final, not subject to dispute, and accepted by Advertiser.\nAdvertiser acknowledges that any analytics provided in the Analytics Dashboard or over email during the Campaign Month are estimates, and that each invoice shall reflect the final charges for each Campaign Month and the balance due.\nAdvertiser shall pay each invoice within thirty (30) days of the conclusion of each Campaign Month.\nAny late payments will accrue interest equal to one-and-one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or the maximum amount allowable under law, whichever is less, compounded monthly.\nIn addition to any other rights or remedies that Taboola may have, Advertiser\u2019s failure to pay any invoices as set forth herein may result in Taboola cancelling or pausing Advertiser\u2019s Campaigns.\nFurther, if Advertiser fails to make any payment as set forth herein, Advertiser shall pay all reasonable expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) incurred by Taboola in collecting such payments.\nIf Taboola agrees to a written request by an Advertiser to send an invoice to a third party on Advertiser\u2019s behalf, Advertiser agrees to remain responsible

Taboola will not charge or collect the Taxes covered by such certificate.\nIn the event that&nbsp;any amount payable by Advertiser hereunder is subject to deduction or withholding for taxes, including value added taxes,&nbsp;the amount&nbsp;payable by Advertiser hereunder shall be increased such that the amount received by Taboola equals the&nbsp;amount stated on the applicable invoice.\nUpon written request, Taboola will provide Advertiser with any&nbsp;forms, documents, or certifications as may be required for Advertiser to satisfy any information reporting or&nbsp;withholding tax obligations with respect to any payments under this Agreement.&nbsp;If applicable, advertiser will be responsible for reporting relevant taxes, including value added taxes, in its place of residency.</li>\n<li>Video Bandwidth Fees: Impressions of any video Advertiser Content that is 6MB or larger, shall incur a&nbsp;\u201cVideo Bandwidth Fee\u201d, at a rate equal to five cents per gigabyte served ($0.00005/MB).\nFor example, if&nbsp;1000 Impressions of an 8MB video Advertiser Content file were served hereunder, the Video Bandwidth&nbsp;Fee with respect that file would be $0.40 (i.e.\n1000 Impressions * 8MB * $.00005).</li>\n<li>Data Fees: Advertiser may be given the ability to target its Advertiser Content to certain audiences on the&nbsp;Taboola Network by using Taboola-provided audience data segments based on inferred&nbsp;Visitor interests or demographics (\u201cData Segments\u201d).\nIf Data Segments are used, CPCs and invoices shall&nbsp;be inclusive of a \u201cData Fee.\u201d Where Advertiser employs such Data Segments, the following restrictions&nbsp;shall apply:\n<ol>\n<li>Advertiser shall not cache the Data Segments in a manner that would permit Advertiser to re-use&nbsp;them (or any functional equivalent or model of them);</li>\n<li>Advertiser shall not resell the Data Segments.\nand</li>\n<li>Advertiser shall not associate the Data Segments with any personal information, such as a first or&nbsp;last name, street address, email address, phone number, or other identifier of a natural person.</li>\n<li>Advertiser shall not utilize the Data Segments in violation of any applicable law (including, if applicable, the Fair Lending Act).</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Campaign Information: Advertiser may change the Campaign Details for a particular month, a portion of a month, or on a going-forward basis at any time dashboard in the Analytics Dashboard.\nAdvertiser acknowledges and agrees that Taboola does not guarantee how often it will

prior written notice to the other party so that it may contest such order or subpoena and, in the event that disclosure is required, only discloses the portion of Confidential Information that is

Agreement.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of Advertiser\u2019s default of its obligations in Paragraph 4 above, Taboola shall have the right, if it so chooses, to commence an action against Advertiser for such default in the appropriate court in the venue and jurisdiction in which Advertiser resides or maintains assets.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Successors and Assigns</strong>: This

otherwise, without the other party\u2019s prior written consent, so long as the acquirer agrees in writing to pay in full any outstanding balance Advertiser owes to Taboola under this Agreement&nbsp;.\nand (b) Taboola may assign this Agreement, without Advertiser\u2019s consent, to its parent company or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Force Majeure</strong>: Neither Advertiser nor Taboola will be liable for delay or default in the performance of its respective obligations under this Agreement if such delay or default is caused by conditions beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, fire, flood, accident, earthquakes, telecommunications line failures, electrical outages, network failures, acts of God, or labor disputes.\nIf Advertiser\u2019s ability to transfer funds to third parties has been materially adversely affected by an event beyond Advertiser\u2019s reasonable control, including, but not limited to, failure of banking clearing systems or a state of emergency, then Advertiser will make every reasonable effort to make payments on a timely basis to Taboola, but any delays caused by such condition will be excused for the duration of such condition.\nSubject to the foregoing, such excuse for delay will not in any way relieve Advertiser from any of its obligations as to the amount of money that would have been due and paid without such condition.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Miscellaneous</strong>: This Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive understanding and agreement between the parties regarding the subject matter herein and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, written or oral, relating to its subject matter.\nThe failure of either party to enforce strict performance by the other party of any provision in this Agreement or to exercise any right under this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of that party\u2019s right to do so at any later point.\nTaboola may modify these at any time.\nNo click-through, online, purchase order or other terms, entered into before or after the execution of this Agreement, will inform the interpretation of this Agreement, or be or remain binding on the parties, and they shall be void.&nbsp;Preprinted terms in Advertiser purchase orders or other customer-generated ordering documents, or terms referenced or linked within them, will have no effect on this Agreement and are hereby rejected, regardless of whether they are signed by Taboola and/or purport to take precedence over this Agreement.&nbsp;In the event that any provision in this Agreement, including its Terms, as applied to any party or to any circumstance, shall be adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void, unenforceable or inoperative as a matter of law, then the same shall in no way affect any other provision in this Insertion Order, including its Terms, the application of such provision in any other circumstance or with respect to any other party, or the validity or enforceability of this Agreement as a whole.\nParagraphs 6, 8-10, 3-4, and 16 of these Terms shall survive termination of this Agreement.\nElectronic signatures on this Agreement shall be as effective and enforceable as originals.\nThis Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Privacy Policy</li>\n<li>Cookie Policy</li>\n<li>Terms and Conditions</li>\n<li>Modern Slavery
