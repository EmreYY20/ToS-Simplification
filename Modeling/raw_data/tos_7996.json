by NET10.\nThe wireless telecommunications networks used to transmit the voice, text, and data services that support the Service offered by NET10 are owned and operated by licensed commercial mobile

time.\nTermination of this Agreement will result in the immediate termination of your Service which may be reactivated if you elect to do so, subject to the acceptance of the then-current Terms and Conditions for Service at the time of such reactivation.\nAny Service which remains unused at the time of termination, including, promotional balances, cannot be refunded or transferred to another person.</p>\n<p>We may terminate this Agreement at any time without notice if we cease to provide Service in your area.\nWe may interrupt, suspend, cancel, or terminate your Service without immediate notice to you for any conduct that we believe violates these Terms and Conditions, including, but not limited to, the following:</p>\n<p>(i) using or directing abusive, vulgar, derogatory, intimidating, or harassing language or conduct towards a NET10 representative, officer, employee, agent, or authorized retailer;</p>\n<p>(ii) using your Service for any unlawful, fraudulent, or

own a basic phone or smartphone.\nAll NET10 Plans provide a certain number of days of Service (\u201cService Days\u201d) per Plan cycle.\nYou will have Service under your Plan so long as you do not reach your maximum allotment of minutes or data (to the extent they are capped) and so long as you have Service Days left on your Plan\u2019s cycle (\u201cPlan Cycle\u201d).\nThe Services that come with our Plans (e.g., talk, text and data) vary and change from time to time.\nFor the latest information what our NET10 Plans offer please visit our website at NET10wireless.com or call Customer Care.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Pay-As-You-Go Plans</b>.\nNET10 Pay-As-You-Go Plans work for basic phones only and come with a certain number of minutes.\nPay-As-You-Go Plans vary in the number of Service Days offered.\nMinutes can be used for calling, text messaging, and data services.\nThe rate to send or receive a regular text message is generally .5 minutes per message.\nThe rate to send and receive an MMS message (picture or video message) is generally 2.5 minutes per message.\nFor incoming messages, minutes are only deducted for messages which are opened.\nOn certain NET10 phones, other text messaging rates may apply.\nSee individual NET10 phone package for details.\nMinutes are also deducted for data services.</p>\n<p>Minutes are deducted for all incoming and outgoing calls, including incoming call waiting calls, simultaneous calls, toll free calls, and calls to 411, 611, Customer Care, and your voice mail.\nFor simultaneous calls, such as incoming call waiting and 3-way calling (where available) minutes will be deducted for each call.\nMinutes are not deducted for calls to 911.\nFor outbound calls, you may be charged minutes for incomplete, busy, or no answer calls.\nMinutes are deducted in full unit increments.\nPartial minutes are rounded up to the next minute.\nNo credit is given for dropped calls.\nYour NET10 phone may include 10 airtime minutes for set up.\nThese minutes may be used for test calls at our discretion.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Monthly Plans</b>.\nNET10 Monthly Plans work on smartphones and basic phones and come with unlimited nationwide calling, text messaging (including international text messaging), and up to a certain amount of high speed data at 4G speeds for each Plan Cycle depending on which Plan you select.\nAll NET10 Monthly Plans come with thirty (30) Service Days.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Upgrade Plans</b>.\nFor more information about Upgrade Plans please refer to Section VI, below.</p>\n<p>\n<b>4.\nUsing Your Service</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Service Days</b>.\nGenerally, once you start a new Plan Cycle, you will lose any unused minutes, data and Service Days remaining on your current Plan unless your Plan provides Carryover Benefits.\nIf your Plan does not provide any Carryover Benefits, you will not receive a refund or credit for any unused minutes, data or Service Days once you begin a new Plan Cycle.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Service End Date</b>.\nTo keep your Service active, you must purchase and redeem a Plan prior to your Service End Date.<b>\n</b>Your Service End Date is the last day of your Plan Cycle and is determined by the date on which you activated your Service by redeeming a Plan.\nIf you fail to redeem a new Plan prior to your Service End Date, your Account will be deactivated on your Service End Date and, if applicable, you may lose your phone number.\nTo prevent this from occurring, please keep your Service active by purchasing a Plan before your Service End Date.\nNET10 reserves the right to deactivate any Account for which there is no usage for a period of six (6) consecutive months for smartphones and twelve (12) consecutive months for basic phones.\nIf your Account is deactivated, it may be reactivated by purchasing and redeeming a new Plan.\nOnce reactivated, you will be assigned a new phone number.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Carryover Benefits</b>.\nCertain Pay-Go Plans provide a Carryover Benefit which allows you to carryover unused minutes when you purchase a new Plan and to combine the number of minutes and Service Days provided by your Pay-Go Plan.\nFor example, if you purchase and redeem two Pay-Go Plans that come with 200 minutes and thirty (30) Service Days, your Account will be credited with 400 minutes and sixty (60) Service Days.\nIf you add a 30-day Pay-Go Plan fifteen (15) days into an existing 30-day Plan Cycle, you will have forty-five (45) Service Days and your Service End Date will be adjusted accordingly.\nAccordingly, you can extend your Service End Date by adding multiple Plans to your Account on or before your Service End Date.</p>\n<p>Please note that upon your redemption of a Monthly Plan, any unused minutes and Service Days carried over under your Account will be cleared and will be replaced with the service and Service Days provided under your new Monthly plan.</p>\n<p>\n<b>NET10 Auto-Refill</b>.\nYou may enroll in Auto-Refill to purchase a new Plan each time your Plan Cycle expires by registering your credit or debit card online with the NET10 website and selecting the Plan you want to purchase on a recurring basis.\nWhen you enroll in Auto-Refill, a new Plan will be automatically purchased and redeemed to your Account each month at the end of your Plan Cycle and your credit or debit card will be automatically charged for the cost of the Plan you elected to purchase on a recurring basis.\nBy enrolling in Auto-Refill, you agree to receive communications from NET10 regarding your enrollment including, without limitation, upcoming payment dates or unsuccessful payment notifications.\nIn the event that your Auto-Refill payment is unsuccessful, Auto-Refill will be suspended on your Account.\nIf you make a payment within ten (10) days of an unsuccessful Auto-Refill payment using the same or a new debit or credit card, you agree that we may resume your Auto-Refill enrollment so that your recurring Plan purchases will continue on a recurring basis.</p>\n<p>\n<b>NET10 Reserve</b>: With NET10 Reserve, you may purchase and add to your Account one or more Monthly Plans.\nIf you have a Monthly Plan in your NET10 Reserve, it will be automatically applied to your Account on your Service End Date.\nYou may redeem the Service Plans in your NET10 Reserve at any time prior to your Service End Date, however, if you do so, you will lose any unused Service and Service Days left under your previous Plan.\nIf you are enrolled in Auto-Refill, the Plans in your NET10 Reserve will take precedence over Auto-Refill and will be redeemed before an Auto-Refill purchase is processed.\nCustomers with Monthly Plans in their NET10 Reserve will also be unable to purchase Pay-Go Plans until all Plans in their NET10 Reserve have been applied.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>5.\nText Messaging</b>\n</p>\n<p>NET10 does not participate in Premium SMS services or campaigns.\nPremium SMS services usually involve sending a text message to a designated \u201cshort code\u201d or attempting to buy SMS services from anyone other than NET10.\nPremium SMS campaigns include casting a vote, expressing your opinion, playing a game, subscribing to a service, or participating in interactive television programs through the use of a wireless phone.</p>\n<p>You should not attempt to participate in Premium SMS services or campaigns other than those authorized by NET10.\nAny text message you send to a \u201cshort code\u201d not authorized by NET10 will likely not go through.\nAny charges you may incur as a result of your attempts to participate in Premium SMS services or campaigns not authorized by NET10, are not refundable.</p>\n<p>\n<b>6.\nData Services</b>\n</p>\n<p>All NET10 Plans provide access to data services.\nYour use of data services (\u201cData Usage\u201d) occurs whenever your phone is connected to the network and is engaged in any data transmission, including, but not limited to, (i) opening or using an internet browser or app in any way, including, but not limited to app installations and updates, (ii)sending, receiving, or downloading any type of content, including, but not limited, emails, documents, pictures, MMS messages or any other content, or (iii) if data access or a data connection is initiated in any other way or for any other purpose.</p>\n<p>Nationwide 5G and 4G/4G LTE networks are not available on all devices and in all locations.\nNationwide 5G and 4G/4G LTE networks require a capable device and SIM card.\nActual availability, coverage, and speeds may vary.\nIf your Plan comes with a fixed amount of high speed data, after your high speed data balance is reached, your data speeds will be reduced to as low as 64 kbps for the remainder of your Plan cycle.\nYour high speed data will be restored once your next Plan Cycle begins unless you purchase a new Monthly Plan prior to the start of your next Plan Cycle.\nIf your data speeds are reduced, the reduced speeds may impact the functionality of some data applications, such as streaming audio or video or web browsing.\nData transmitted over Wi-Fi does not count against your data balance.</p>\n<p>Depending on the Carrier network, your Monthly Plan may be automatically enabled with a feature that optimizes all detectable video streaming to DVD-quality (typically 480p) through the Carrier\u2019s network (\u201cData Optimizer\u201d).\nData Optimizer manages the amount of data used when streaming video on your phone in order to improve your experience by reducing the chances of your video stalling or buffering.\nYou may disable the Data Optimizer feature at any time by contacting Customer Care.\nVideo streaming over a Wi-Fi connection will be delivered at the video\u2019s native resolution.</p>\n<p>Some apps, content, programs, and software that you download or that come preloaded on your phone automatically and regularly send and receive data transmissions in order to function properly, without you affirmatively initiating the request and without your knowledge.\nFor example, mobile apps that provide real-time information and location-based information connect to our network and send and receive updated information so that it is available to you when you want to access it.\nYour Account balance will be deducted for all Data Usage initiated by your phone, including, Data Usage for connections that you affirmatively initiate and for those that run automatically in the background without your knowledge whether they are successful or not.\nThe duration of your data connection and the associated Data Usage is not determined from the exact moment you press a button on your phone.\nData Usage also depends on the size of the content and the actual time it takes to download or transmit the content or MMS message.\nIf you cancel or attempt to cancel a download or transmission in progress, or if the process is otherwise interrupted through no action on your part, you will still incur Data Usage.\nUnless you are using Wi-Fi, any Data Usage on your phone, will count against your Account balance.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Pay-As-You-Go Plans</b>.\nWith Pay-As-You-Go Plans that come with minutes only, one (1) minute will be deducted from your Account per (1) minute of Data Usage.\nMinutes deducted for Data Usage are deducted in full minute increments.\nData Usage lasting less than sixty (60) seconds will be rounded up to the next full minute.\nYour NET10 phone will not allow you to access NET10\u2019s Mobile Web Portal without a balance of at least 10 minutes.\nFor MMS messages, your Account will be deducted 2.5 minutes for each MMS message you send or receive in addition to the one (1) minute deduction for each minute it takes to send or receive the MMS message.\nThe number of minutes deducted from your Account for sending or receiving an MMS message will vary depending on the size of the MMS message and the amount of time required to complete the transmission.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Online Content and Apps</b>.\nWith certain NET10 Phones, you may be able to view, access, use, or download online content (\u201cContent\u201d) using NET10\u2019s Mobile Web Portal, an internet browser, an app store, or a mobile app depending on your phone type (e.g., basic phone or smartphone).\nIn addition to any minute or data balances deducted for Data Usage, you may be charge for any online Content (\u201cContent Charge\u201d) you purchase.\nContent Charges on NET10\u2019s Mobile Web Portal vary depending on the type of Content.\nYou will be advised of any Content Charges prior to finalizing your purchase.\nWhen you have selected a title and are ready to make your purchase, click on \u201cBuy\u201d and the Content Charge will be shown in both U.S.\nDollars and in minutes.\nYou will have the opportunity to select one of two payment options: (1) you may use a credit card to complete your purchase or (2) you may select a direct deduction of minutes from your NET10 phone.\nContent Charges paid via direct deduction of minutes are calculated using a dollar-to-minute conversion factor of $1.00 equals 10 minutes of airtime.\nThe costs for Data Services in U.S.\nDollars and/or minutes and the dollar-to-minute conversion factor are subject to change at any time without notice.\nThe total Access Charge will vary depending on the size of the content and the actual time it takes to complete the download.\nAny Content you purchase and download may only be used or viewed on the phone used to purchase and download the Content and cannot be transferred to another phone, including, a new or replacement NET10 phone.\nAll Content Charges are non-refundable.</p>\n<p>For any third-party Content downloads that are unrelated to NET10 you may also be subject to a Content Charge from the third-party provider of the Content you have purchased.\nIn the event you purchase Content from a third-party, you agree that NET10 is not responsible for the purchase, download, transfer, installation, use, transmission failure, interruption, or delay related to any Content.\nYou further agree that any support questions related to such third-party Content should be directed to the third-party provider of the Content and not NET10.\nWhen you use, download, or install any third-party Content, you may be subject to additional license terms, terms of use, privacy policies and/or other terms and conditions of the third-party provider of that Content.\nYou agree that NET10 is not responsible for any third-party Content you access or download using your phone.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Content Not Rated</b>.\nThe Content available or accessible through NET10\u2019s Mobile\u2019s Web Portal is not rated or filtered.\nAlthough NET10 strives to present and offer only generally acceptable Content, it is impossible to proof all online Content that may be available.\nNET10\u2019s Mobile Web Portal may provide access to Content that is offensive or objectionable to you or to others.\nYou are solely responsible for any Content you access, view, or download from NET10\u2019s Mobile Web Portal and you assume all risk and liability in doing so.\nNET10 is not liable for any Content that you or others using your phone may find offensive or objectionable.\nFurther, not all of the Content accessible using NET10\u2019s Mobile Web Portal is intended for children under the age of 13.\nIn the event that you, as a legal guardian allow your child to access Content using NET10\u2019s Mobile Web Portal, you acknowledge that your child has the permission to use the NET10 Mobile Web Portal available on your phone.\nYou further acknowledge that as a legal guardian, it is your responsibility to determine whether using NET10 Mobile Web Portal is appropriate for your child.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Prioritization, Availability, Interruptions, and Discontinuation to Data Services</b>.\nSome Carriers differentiate the wireless service they sell by prioritizing the data traffic of their customers over the data traffic of customers on a non-Carrier brand at times and at locations where there are competing customer demands for network resources.\nWhere the network is lightly loaded, a NET10 customer will notice little, if any, effect from having lower priority.\nThis will be the case in the vast majority of times and locations.\nAt times and at locations where the network is heavily loaded in relation to available capacity, however, a NET10 customer will experience increased latency during a data session, particularly, if the customer is engaged in a data-intensive activity.\nWhen network loading goes down or if a customer moves to a location that is less heavily loaded in relation to available capacity, the latency associated with a customer\u2019s data connection will improve.</p>\n<p>NET10 does not guarantee the availability of Data Services and reserves the right to modify, suspend, cancel, interrupt, discontinue, terminate or reduce your data throughput speed without notice if you are engaged in any unauthorized use or if your usage adversely impacts a Carrier\u2019s network or customer service levels.\nNET10 is not responsible and will not be liable for any modifications, interruptions or discontinuation of the Data Services or for any failure to receive content you purchased using Data Services.\nIf your Data Services are modified, suspended, canceled, interrupted, discontinued or terminated, NET10 will not provide you with a refund for any remaining used or unused Data Services.</p>\n<p>\n<b>7.\nInternational Long Distance</b>\n</p>\n<p>NET10 offers its customers international long distance service (\u201cILD Service\u201d) as an additional

you use a Wi-Fi network for making or receiving calls and text messages or for any other reason, you acknowledge and agree that your use of such Wi-Fi network is permissible and that you are solely responsible for such use.\nUsing your Wi-Fi Calling feature may provide you with access to an unsecured Wi-Fi network which could impact your data security.\nYou can disable Wi-Fi Calling by toggling it off in your device settings menu.</p>\n<p>Although we recommend that you use your wireless service as your primary method of contacting 911, you may be able to use Wi-Fi Calling for dialing 911 if your phone is equipped with this feature and you have access to the internet through your phone\u2019s W-Fi connection.\nTo dial 911 using Wi-Fi Calling, you must provide us with an address for your primary use of Wi-Fi (\u201cPrimary Address\u201d) at the time of activation.\nIf the location at which you primarily use Wi-Fi changes, either temporarily or permanently, you must register the new address online at e911-reg.tracfone.com or by contacting Customer Care at 1-877-836-2368.\nIt may take 24 hours or more to update your address information.\nIf you do not give us your Primary Address, we will block your ability to use Wi-Fi calling.\nWhen you use Wi-Fi Calling to dial 911 and you are away from your Primary Address, we will have no information about your location.\nAs such, always be prepared to report your precise location to emergency responders.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that dialing 911 via Wi-Fi Calling requires access to the internet and operates differently than traditional 911 calling services.\nFor example, 911 service via Wi-Fi Calling may be limited or not available due to various circumstances, including, relocation of equipment, loss or disruption of power, internet or wireless service, internet congestion or a connection failure, delays in availability of registered location information, and/or other technical problems.</p>\n<p>\n<b>TTY Limitations for 911 Calls:</b> Due to technical limitations, Wi-Fi Calling cannot be used with TTY devices and will not support 911 calls over TTY devices.\nPersons with communications disabilities can still reach 911 services by either (1) calling 911 directly using a TTY over the cellular network or from a landline telephone, (2) sending a text message to 911 directly (in areas where text-to-911 is available) from a wireless device, (3) using relay services to place a TTY or captioned telephone service (CTS) call from a wireless phone over the cellular network or from a landline telephone, or (4) using relay services to place a IP Relay or IP CTS call over a cellular data or other IP network.</p>\n<p>\n<b>12.\nEmergency Calls</b>\n</p>\n<p>If you are in an area where your phone is searching for a wireless signal or there is no wireless signal or wireless service, it is highly probable that a call to 911 will not go through.\nDo not rely solely on your NET10 Service in an emergency situation.\nIn an emergency, locate the nearest landline phone and call for help.</p>\n<p>\n<b>13.\nDisclaimer of Warranties</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>NET10 PRODUCTS AND SERVICE ARE PROVIDED ON

NUMBER TO ANOTHER WIRELESS CARRIER OR YOUR ACCOUNT IS INACTIVE FOR A PERIOD OF 24 CONSECUTIVE MONTHS, YOU WILL PERMANENTLY LOSE ALL OF YOUR UPGRADE POINTS.</b>\n</p>\n<p>NET10 Upgrade Plans are unique airtime plans that provide you with the ability to upgrade your NET10 phone at a discount at the end of an eligible upgrade period (\u201cUpgrade Period\u201d) by accumulating points (\u201cUpgrade Points\u201d) awarded to you after purchasing an Upgrade Plan.\nThe length of your Upgrade Period and the amount of Upgrade Points you can accumulate depend on which Upgrade Plan you purchase and the number of Upgrade Plans you purchase.\nAll NET10 Upgrade Plans include unlimited voice and text messaging services and a fixed amount of high speed data for each monthly plan cycle.\nThe amount of data that can be accessed at high speed depends on which Upgrade Plan you purchase.\nAfter your high speed data threshold is reached, your data speed will be reduced to as low as 64 kbps for the remainder of your monthly plan cycle.\nYour high speed data will be restored once your next plan cycle begins unless you purchase a new NET10 Upgrade Plan prior to the start of your next plan cycle.\nIf your data speed is reduced, the reduced speed may impact the functionality of some data applications, such as streaming audio or video or web browsing.\nSome NET10 Upgrade Plans may provide international calling and texting depending on the destination.\nFor more information regarding international calling please visit our website.</p>\n<p>In addition to voice, text messaging, and data

and continue to accrue Upgrade Points based on your new plan.\nYou can also switch between an Upgrade Plan and another NET10 Service plan.\nhowever, you will only accumulate Upgrade Points by purchasing a NET10 Upgrade Plan.</p>\n<p>Because you can switch between Upgrade Plans, the length of your Upgrade Period will depend on which Upgrade Plan you purchase while accumulating the required 18 Upgrade Points.\nAfter you have reached 18 Upgrade Points, you may continue to accumulate Upgrade Points before using your Upgrade Discount.\nhowever, Upgrade Discounts are only awarded in intervals of 18 Upgrade Points.\nAs such, once you accumulate another 18 Upgrade Points you will become eligible for another Upgrade Discount.\nFor more information and examples of how Upgrade Points and Upgrade Discounts work please visit our FAQ section online.</p>\n<p>Upgrade Points have no cash value, cannot be refunded, or transferred to another customer.\nIf you switch between a NET10 Upgrade Plan and another NET10 service plan you will not lose your Upgrade Points.\nIf, however, you port-out or transfer your NET10 telephone number to another wireless carrier, you will permanently lose all of your Upgrade Points.\nIf you have purchased a NET10 phone using your Upgrade Discount and you return your phone, your Upgrade Points will be returned to your account once we have verified your return.\nIn the event you return your phone, you will only be entitled to a refund for the amount you paid after applying your Upgrade Discount.</p>\n<p>If your NET10 Service is deactivated due to your inactivity, you will not lose your Upgrade Points, unless the period of your inactivity exceeds 24 months measured from your Service End Date in which case all of your Upgrade Points will expire.\nIf you reactivate your account through the purchase of a NET10 Upgrade Plan (before the expiration of the 24-month inactivity period), your Upgrade Points will be reinstated.\nhowever, it is likely that you will lose your NET10 phone number due to any extended inactivity.\nYour Upgrade Points will be linked to the electronic serial number (ESN) of your NET10 phone.\nTherefore, any

workmanship that result in Product failure during normal usage.</p>\n<p>2.\nThe limited warranty extends only to the original purchaser (\u201cPurchaser\u201d) of the Product and is not assignable or transferable to any subsequent purchaser.\nThe limited warranty extends only to Purchasers who purchase the Product in its original packaging from an authorized dealer or retailer.\nUpon request from NET10, the Purchaser must prove the date of the original purchase of the Product by a dated bill of sale or dated itemized receipt.</p>\n<p>3.\nDuring the limited warranty period, NET10 will replace or repair, at NET10\u2019s sole option, any defective Products or parts (except as excluded below) with new or refurbished Products or parts if such replacement or repair is needed because of Product malfunction or failure during normal usage.\nNET10 may, in its sole discretion, replace the Product with a different but comparable Product if the same exact Product is not available.\nThe replacement Product may consist of refurbished equipment that contains used components, some of which have been reprocessed.\nAll used components shall comply with Product performance and reliability specifications.</p>\n<p>4.\nThe limited warranty does not cover loss of personal information, passwords, contacts, music, ringtones, pictures, videos, applications or other content, memory cards, software, defects in appearance, cosmetic, decorative or structural items, including framing, and any non-operative parts.\nNET10\u2019s limit of liability under this limited warranty is the actual cash value of the Product at the time the Purchaser returns the Product to NET10 for repair, determined by the price paid by the Purchaser for the Product less a reasonable amount for usage.\nNET10 shall not be liable for any other losses or damages.\nThese remedies are the Purchaser\u2019s exclusive remedies for breach of warranty.</p>\n<p>5.\nThe Purchaser shall have no coverage or benefits under this limited warranty if any of the following conditions are applicable:</p>\n<p>(a) The Product has been subjected to abnormal use, abnormal conditions, improper storage, exposure to moisture or dampness, unauthorized modifications, unauthorized connections, unauthorized repair, misuse, neglect, abuse, accident, alteration, improper installation, or other acts which are not the fault of NET10, including damage caused by shipping.</p>\n<p>(b) The Product has been damaged from external causes such as collision with an object, or from fire, flooding, sand, dirt, windstorm, lightning, earthquake or damage from exposure to weather conditions, an act of God, or battery leakage, theft, blown fuse, or improper use of any electrical source, damage caused by computer or internet viruses, bugs, worms, Trojan Horses, \u201ccancel-bots\u201d or damage caused by the connection to other products not recommended for interconnection by NET10.</p>\n<p>(c) NET10 was not advised in writing of

in rendering service under the limited warranty, loss of use of the service during the period that the product is returned for replacement or warranty service or for the loss or unauthorized use of customer passwords, personal information, contacts, pictures, videos, applications, music, ringtones and other content.</p>\n<p>7.\nNET10 neither assumes nor authorizes any authorized service center or any other person or entity to assume for it any other obligation or liability beyond that which is expressly provided for in this limited warranty including the provider or seller of any extended warranty or service agreement.</p>\n<p>8.\nThis is the entire warranty between NET10 and the Purchaser, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements or understandings, oral or written, relating to the Product, and no representation, promise or condition not contained herein shall modify these terms.</p>\n<p>9.\nThis limited warranty allocates the risk of failure of the Product between the Purchaser and NET10.\nThe allocation is recognized by the Purchaser and is reflected in the purchase price.\nSome states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental and consequential damages, so certain of the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you (the Purchaser).\nThis limited warranty gives the Purchaser specific legal rights and the Purchaser may also have other rights which vary from state to state.</p>\n<p>\n<b>IX.\nUnlocking Policy</b>\n</p>\n<p>Unlocking a NET10 device refers to disabling software that would otherwise prevent you from
