Policy</strong>\n<p>\n<em>Last Modified: June 16, 2020</em>\n</p>We use Tracking Technologies<p>When you visit our Sites and access or use our Service, read our emails, or otherwise engage with us through a computer or mobile device, we and our third-party partners, automatically collect information about how you access and use the Service and information about the device you use to access the Service.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>This information allows us to improve your customer experience.\nFor example, we or third parties we work with use tracking technologies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To recognize new or current customers.</li>\n<li>To store your password if you are registered on our Sites.</li>\n<li>To improve our Service.</li>\n<li>To serve you with interest-based or targeted advertising (see below for more on interest-based advertising).</li>\n<li>To observe your behaviors and browsing activities over time across multiple websites or other platforms.</li>\n<li>To better understand the interests of our customers and Site visitors.</li>\n</ul>Third party data collection and interest-based advertising<p>We participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your browsing history.\nWe permit third party online advertising networks, social media companies and other third-party services, to collect information about your use of our Sites, including our mobile apps, over time so that they may play or display ads on our Service, on other websites, apps or services you may use, and on other devices you may use.\nTypically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through tracking technologies, such as &nbsp;cookies, Flash objects, web beacons, embedded scripts, mobile SDKs, location-identifying technologies, and similar technology (collectively, \u201ctracking technologies\u201d), which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including click stream information, browser type, time and date you visited the site, device ID or AdID, precise geolocation and other information.\nWe may share a common account identifier (such as a hashed email address or user ID) with our third-party advertising partners to help identify you across devices.\nWe and our third-party partners use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market research.\nWe may also use services provided by third parties (such as social media platforms) to serve targeted ads to you and others on such platforms.\nWe may do this by providing a hashed version of your email address or other information to the platform provider.\nSee <strong>Your Ad Choices</strong> below, to learn more about interest-based advertising.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>Social media widgets and advertising<p>Our Service may include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, LinkedIn, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter or other widgets.\nThese social media companies may recognize you and collect information about your visit to our Service, and they may set a cookie or employ other tracking technologies.\nYour interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of those companies.</p>\n<p>We display targeted advertising to you through social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and other social media forums.\nThese companies have interest-based advertising programs that allow us to direct advertisements to users who have shown interest in our Service while those users are on the social media platform, or to groups of other users who share similar traits, such as likely commercial interests and demographics.\nWe may share a unique identifier, such as a user ID or hashed email address, with these platform providers or they may collect information from our website visitors through a first-party pixel, in order to direct targeted advertising to you or to a custom audience on the social media platform.\nThese advertisements are governed by the privacy policies of those social media companies that provide them.\nIf you do not want to receive targeted ads on your social networks, you may be able to adjust your advertising preferences through your settings on those networks.\nYou may learn more about advertising preferences by clicking on the links provided below.\nPlease note that these links are provided for your convenience only and we do not control the content or features that may be available on these third party services.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Facebook.</strong> Learn more about your advertising preferences on Facebook Companies.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Twitter.</strong> Learn more about privacy controls for personalized ads on Twitter.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>LinkedIn.</strong> Learn more about advertising preferences on LinkedIn.</li>\n</ul>Cross-Device linking<p>We, or our third-party partners, may link your various devices so that content you see on one device can result in relevant advertising on another device.\nWe do this by collecting information about each device you use when you are logged in to our Service.\nWe may also work with third party partners who employ tracking technologies, or the application of statistical modeling tools, to determine if two or more devices are linked to a single user or household.\nWe may share a common account identifier (such as an email address or user ID) with third party advertising partners to help recognize you across devices.\nWe, and our partners, can use this cross-device linkage to serve interest-based advertising and other personalized content to you across your devices, to perform analytics and to measure the performance of our advertising campaigns.</p>Third party partners<p>The following is a sample of the third-party service partners we work with to provide cross-device linking and/or advertising services.\nWe will strive to update this list if or when we work with new partners which offer you choices about the collection of your information, but as partners change and new technologies become available, this list is likely to change over time and may not always reflect our current partners.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<u>Google Analytics and Advertising</u>.&nbsp;We use Google Analytics to recognize you and link the devices you use when you visit our site or Service on your browser or mobile device, log in to your account on our Service, or otherwise engage with us.&nbsp;We share a unique identifier, like a user ID or hashed email address, with Google to facilitate the service.&nbsp;Google Analytics allows us to better understand how our users interact with our Service and to tailor our advertisements and content to you.&nbsp;For information on how Google Analytics

of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you viewed or engaged with our emails.</p>\n<p>Deleting cookies does not delete Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as Flash objects and HTML5.&nbsp;You can learn more about Flash objects on Adobe's website - including how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies.\nIf you choose to delete Flash objects from

http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices, and/or the DAA\u2019s resources at www.aboutads.info/choices.\nPlease note that these opt-out choices may not affect online advertising that is not cookie-based.\n<p>\n</p>Cross-device linking Please note that opting-out of receiving interest-based advertising through the NAI\u2019s and DAA\u2019s online resources will only opt-out a user from receiving interest-based ads on that specific browser or device, but the user may still receive interest-based ads on his or her other devices.\nYou must perform the opt-out on each browser or device you use.<p>\n</p>Mobile advertising You may also be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings on your mobile device by selecting \u201climit ad tracking\u201d (iOS) or

http://youradchoices.com/appchoices and downloading the mobile AppChoices app.\nYou may be able to limit the use of location data for advertising purposes by adjusting your location services settings on your mobile device.\n<p>Note that some of these opt-outs may not be effective unless your browser is set to accept cookies.\nIf you delete cookies, change your browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another operating system, you may need to opt-out again.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n</ul> Stay Connected <ul>\n<li>About Us</li>\n<li>Contact

Rules and Procedures\u201d), and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\nThe JAMS Rules and Procedures are available at

as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive or more expensive than the cost of litigation.\nIf any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal (other than that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis), or otherwise conflicts with the rules and procedures established by JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.\nIf, however, the portion that is deemed invalid, unenforceable or illegal is that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither claimant nor Taco Bell shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.\nTHE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PURSUANT TO THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL BE IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nTHE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN THE CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED.</p>\n<p>No Illegal, Infringing or Abusive Message Content: You understand and acknowledge that you are responsible for the content of your Messages, and agree not to include
