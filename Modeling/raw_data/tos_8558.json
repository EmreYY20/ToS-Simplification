The takedown process provided for by the DMCA is a tool for copyright holders to have user-uploaded material that infringes their copyrights taken down from our website.\nThe process entails the copyright owner (or the owner\u2019s agent) sending a copyright infringement takedown request to a service provider requesting that the provider remove material that the copyright owner contends is infringing their copyright(s).\nOnce a website is in receipt of the takedown request, it is required to send the takedown request to the uploader of the material in question.\nThe uploader is subsequently given a chance to respond to the takedown request .\nThe mechanism serves as an initial step for the copyright holder and the uploader to resolve any dispute relating to the copyrighted material at issue.\nFor that purpose, NKL is required to process and transfer limited personal data between the individuals submitting a takedown request (i.e., the alleged copyright holder) and the uploader.\nIn compliance with the DMCA, we only accept copyright infringement takedown notices from content owners or someone officially authorized to act on their behalf.\nTo read more about the requirements of a complete notice, we invite you to visit https://www.dmca.com/faq/What-is-a-DMCA-Takedown, and consult with your own counsel.\n(We do not and cannot provide you with legal advice, and none should be implied from this Privacy Notice or anything else on our site.)
