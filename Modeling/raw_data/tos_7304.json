privacy policy (\u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d) in order to set out how we collect, use, and disclose information through our website located at www.Opencare.com (the \u201cWebsite\u201d) as well as to information we collect and use when we provide services on behalf of our dental practice customers (<strong>\u201cPractices\u201d</strong>).\nThis Privacy Policy applies to all of the products and services (as more particularly described in our Terms of Use) offered by Opencare, as well as the Website, and other websites offered by Opencare or our related, affiliated and/or subsidiary companies (collectively the <strong>\u201cServices\u201d</strong>), unless another applicable privacy policy is posted on that Service.</p>\n<p>The privacy of our customers is of great importance to us.\nBy visiting our Website and/or using the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you have read the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy and you understand that your information will be collected, used and disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nIf you do not agree with our policies and practices, you should not use the Website or the Services.</p>\n<p>IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA OR NEVADA, PLEASE SEE THE SECTIONS \u201cCALIFORNIA CONSUMER NOTICE\u201d OR \u201cNEVADA PRIVACY RIGHTS\u201d FOR SPECIFIC DISCLOSURES WITH RESPECT TO OUR COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION AND ADDITIONAL RIGHTS YOU HAVE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.</p> 2.\nWHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER? <p>This Privacy Policy describes our collection, use and disclosure of information, including information which can be used to identify an individual (\u201cPersonal Information\u201d).\nPersonal Information does not include any anonymized information which we may create or derive from information (including Personal Information) you provide to us.</p>\n<p>Personal Information may be collected about Practice employees, our prospective customers, visitors to the Website, and end users of the Services.\nYou can choose not to provide us with certain Personal Information, but by doing so, you may not be able to take advantage of many of the features and functionality of our Services.</p>\n<p>We may also collect Personal Information about patients of Practices on behalf of the Practice, which we use only as a service provider in order to provide the Practice with our services.\nThis Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, including Practices.\nPractices are responsible for maintaining their own privacy policies governing the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information and for ensuring that they have obtained the necessary authorizations and consents for any Personal Information made available to us for use in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nIf you have any questions regarding the privacy practices of a particular Practice, please contact the Practice directly.</p> PHIPA <p>In Canada, Opencare is a service provider and may act as a service provider, information manager or electronic service provider under applicable privacy legislation, including Ontario\u2019s Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA) regulations.</p> HIPAA and PHI <p>Some of the Personal Information received by Opencare in connection with the Services may be provided by Practices who are health care providers that are subject to health information data protection laws and regulations.\nIn the United States, this includes rules issued under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), that govern the use and disclosure of certain individually identifiable health-related Personal Information (\u201cProtected Health Information\u201d or \u201cPHI\u201d) by covered entities and their business associates.\nWhen we receive Protected Health Information, we may do so as a \u201cBusiness Associate\u201d of the health care provider under an agreement that, among other things, generally prohibits us from using or disclosing the Protected Health Information in ways that are not permissible by the health care provider itself, and requires us to implement certain measures to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Protected Health Information.\nWhen we act as a Business Associate, we may be subject to certain laws and regulations, including certain HIPAA rules, that govern our use and disclosure of Protected Health Information and that may be more restrictive than otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy.</p> 3.\nCOLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION AND OTHER DATA Types of information we collect <p>Generally the

able to set your browser to notify you when you are sent a cookie.\nThis gives you the choice to decide whether or not to accept it.</p> Interest based advertising <p>For more information about interest-based advertising and to understand your options, including how you can opt-out of receiving behavioural ads from third-party advertising companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada, please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada website at http://youradchoices.ca/choices.</p>\n<p>You can opt out of targeted advertising from third parties by using the links below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads</li>\n<li>Google: https://www.google.com/settings/ads/anonymous</li>\n<li>Microsoft: https://account.microsoft.com/privacy/ad-settings/signedout</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, you can opt out of some of these services by visiting the U.S.\nDigital Advertising Alliance\u2019s opt-out portal at: http://optout.aboutads.info/.</p>\n<p>Please note that even if you opt-out of interest-based advertising by a third party, these tracking technologies may still collect data for other purposes including analytics and you will still see ads from us, but the ads will not be targeted based on behavioural information about you and may therefore be less relevant to you and your interests.</p>\n<p>To successfully opt out, you must have cookies enabled in your web browser (see your browser\u2019s instructions for information on cookies and how to enable them).\nYour opt-out only applies to the web browser you use so you must opt-out of each web browser on each computer you use.\nOnce you opt out, if you delete your browser\u2019s saved cookies, you will need to opt-out again.</p>\n<p>At this time, this Service does not support Do-Not-Track signals.\nHowever, you can follow the instructions above to opt-out of interest-based advertising.</p> 11.\nSECURITY <p>Opencare has implemented commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your user data, including any personal information or PHI, from accidental loss and from unauthorized

provide an absolute guarantee concerning the security of your information.\nIf you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the \u201cContact Us\u201d section below.</p> 12.\nCALIFORNIA CONSUMER NOTICE <p>We collect information (some of which may also constitute Personal Information) that identifies, relates to, describes, references, or is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d) refers to such information as \u201cpersonal information.\u201d If you are a California consumer, as defined by CCPA, the CCPA provides you with specific rights regarding your personal information.\nThis section describes the rights that California consumers have and explains how to exercise those rights.\nFor the purposes of this section, personal information does not include (i) information that is lawfully made available from federal, state or local government records, (ii) de-identified or aggregated data or (iii) information excluded from the scope of the CCPA.</p>\n<p>We also may collect or process personal information, such as the health data, on behalf of our Practice clients to provide them with our Services.\nIn such cases, we are collecting or processing such information as \u201cservice providers\u201d under CCPA, at our customers\u2019 direction, and the customer\u2019s privacy policy, not this Privacy Policy, will apply to the collection and use of such information.\nPlease consult

identifiers.</li>\n<li>Internet or other similar network activity.</li>\n<li>Location data.</li>\n<li>Sensory data.</li>\n</ul> Rights to Your Information <ul>\n<li> Right to Know <br>\n<p>As a California consumer, you have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection, use, disclosure or sale of your personal information over the past 12 months

you.</li>\n<li>The categories of sources from which the personal information is collected.</li>\n<li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal

service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.\nHowever, we may retain personal information that has been de-identified or

value of the information, including the risk of harm to you posed by any authorized access or deletion.\nGenerally speaking, verification will be performed by matching the identifying information provided by you to the personal information that we already have.</p>\n<p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request (and will not be made more than twice in a 12-month period).\nIf we cannot comply with a request, or cannot fully comply with a request, the response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply.</p>\n</li>\n<li> Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights <br>\n<p>You have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the \"right to opt-out\").\nWe

submit a request to us by visiting the following Internet Web page: Do Not Sell My Personal Information.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you may submit an opt-out request by

benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>\n<li>Providing you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>\n<li>Suggesting that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>\n</ul> Financial Incentives <p>We may offer you financial incentives, including discounts, coupons, gift cards or other rewards, for sharing personal information through our referral program and other programs that we may provide from time to time.\nYour participation in these programs is completely optional and subject to the terms
