various pages of our Site.\nThey consist of small text files that are stored on your computer.\nMost of these cookies used by us will be erased from your hard drive immediately after your browser session (so-called session cookies).\n</li>\n<li>Other cookies remain saved to your computer's hard drive and enable us to recognize your computer in the event of a later visit to our website (so-called persistent cookies).\nIt is particularly these cookies that allow us to make our Site more user-friendly, effective and safe.\nThanks to these files, for example, it is possible to display information specifically suited to your personal preferences on a certain webpage.\nThese cookies will be erased automatically after the duration of one year.\n</li>\n<li> The legal grounds for processing the cookie information consists of the execution of the agreement as well as of our rightful interest towards the safe and user-friendly presentation of our Site.\n</li>\n<li>For the same reason, the Site uses cookies to distinguish you from other users.\nStratasys may use a cookie file, which is stored on the browser or hard drive of your computer and/or your mobile telephone device, to obtain information about your general internet usage.\nCookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's and/or mobile telephone device's hard drive.\nThey help us to improve the Site and the Services, and to deliver a better and more personalised service.\nThey enable Stratasys: </li>\n<ul>\n<li>to estimate Stratasys's audience size and usage pattern and perform other analytics;</li>\n<li>to store information about your preferences and so allow Stratasys to customise the Site and/or Services according to your individual interests.\n</li>\n<li>to continually improve Stratasys' services.\nand</li>\n<li>to recognise you when you return to the Site.</li>\n</ul>\n<li> You may block cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies.\nHowever, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of the Site.\nUnless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, Stratasys' system will issue cookies when you log on to the Site and/or use the Services or our Software.\nYou may wish to look at https://www.aboutcookies.org/which has further information on cookies and how to manage them.\n</li>\n<li>The help function in the menu of most browsers explains how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies, how to signal to your browser about the reception of a new cookie and also, how you can erase all collected cookies as well as how to block all future ones.\n</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Please act as following:</li>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>In Internet Explorer:</strong>\n</li>\n<ol>\n<li>Select the item \"Internet Options\" from the \"Extras\" menu in the toolbar.</li>\n<li>Select the \"Privacy\" tab.</li>\n<li>Now, you can choose the safety settings for the internet zone.\nYou select the cookies that are to be accepted or denied.\n</li>\n<li>Click \"OK\" to confirm these settings.</li>\n</ol>\n<li>\n<strong>In Firefox:</strong>\n</li>\n<ol>\n<li>Select \"Settings\" from the toolbar.</li>\n<li>Click \"Privacy\".</li>\n<li>Select \"Use custom settings for history\" from the dropdown menu.</li>\n<li>Now you can select whether cookies are to be accepted and for what duration you want to store the cookies.\nYou can also add exceptions and determine the websites that are always or never allowed to store

\"Settings\".</li>\n<li>Click the link \"Show advanced settings...\".</li>\n<li>Click \"Content Settings...\".</li>\n<li>In the \"Cookies\" section, you can select the following settings:</li>\n</ol>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li> We remind you however that, in the event of limited cookie settings on your computer, you will not be able anymore to use all functions of our Site to the fullest extent possible.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Analysis tools and Internet Technologies</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The legal basis for the processing of your data along with collective analytical tools and internet technologies is our rightful interest towards an analysis of the activities on our website and the user's and surfer's behaviour on the Site, as well as our interest (and the interest of third parties) in the inclusion of personalized advertisement suited to your interests.\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>Google Analytics</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li> This Site uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc.\n(\"Google\").\nGoogle Analytics makes use of so-called \"cookies\" as mentioned before, text files stored on your computer that allow an analysis of your use of our website.\nIn principle, the information about your use of our website as displayed by the cookie is transferred to and stored on the Google server in the US.\nWe activated a so-called IP anonymization on this website, which means that Google shortens the IP addresses from within EU Member States or from other EEA treaty states before they are exported to the US server.\nOnly in exceptional cases, the full IP address may be transferred to the US Google server before it is shortened in the US.\n</li>\n<li> As instructed by this Site's operator, Google will use the information for the purpose of analysing your use of our Site, to compose reports on the activities on our Site and to provide further services to the website's operator related to the use of the website and the internet.\nThe IP address that is transferred by your browser and that is shortened before storing for the purposes of Google Analytics will not be added to other Google data.\nYou can prevent the storage of the cookies through the applicable settings of your browser software, however we remind you that, in certain instances, this may cause that you will not be able to use all functions of our Site to the fullest extent possible.\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>Retargeting</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li> This website makes use of retargeting technologies that are administered by other operators.\nThrough retargeting, users of our partners' websites, who were interested in our Site and in our Services before, can be approached with personalized advertisements.\nStudies show that the inclusion of personalized advertisements that are related to people's actual interests are more appealing to the user than advertisements without any personal connection.\nThrough retargeting, the incorporation of advertisements is based on the analysis of cookies that display earlier user's conduct.\nOf course, no personal information is stored in this process and, obviously, the use of retargeting technology occurs in compliance with the legal provisions on data protection.\nIf you do not consent to this mode of advertisement, you can deactivate cookies and/or delete existing cookies through your browser settings.\nYou can do so by following the instructions under \"Cookies\".\nYou can revoke the cookies-based analysis with altering consequences for the future by saving a cookie opt-out on your personal device in accordance with the aforementioned instructions.\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>More internet technologies</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li> As mentioned before, our website collects and stores information on the visitors' surfing conduct in an anonymized way, through the use of various internet technologies.\nThis data is saved to your computer through cookies and enables us to analyse your anonymized surfing conduct, for instance: a user's city of origin, the type of browser and operating system he or she uses and the pages he visited on the internet.\nThis data can in no event be used to personally identify the visitor of our webpage.\nThe stored data are only used to improve our product and service.\nTherefore, all IP addresses are shortened and thus processed in an anonymous way.\nIt is not used in a different way or disclosed to third parties </li>\n<ul>\n<li> You can generally revoke your consent for the collection, processing and the use of data by a analytics or retargeting technologies commissioned by this website, with altering consequences for the future.\nIt will save a cookie opt-out to your device.\nThis revocation will remain effective as long as you do not erase this cookie.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<li>\n<strong>5.4 Click stream data</strong>\n<br>As you browse the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web site you visit.\nThis information, which is sometimes called \"clickstream\" data, can be collected and stored by a web site's server.\nClickstream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use, the address of the web site from which you linked to the Site, and in some instances, your e-mail address.\nWe may use clickstream data to determine how much time visitors spend on each page of the Site and how they navigate through the Site.\nWe will only use this information to improve the Site.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n</ul> 6.\n<strong>THE WAY WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>6.1 All of the ways in which we use (or 'process') your Personal Information, as described further below in this clause or elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, are based on one of a number of legal conditions provided for under applicable data protection laws.\nTypically these will include: </li>\n<ul>\n<li>6.1.1 <strong>processing which is

purpose of storing such information on our behalf, or carrying out other processing on our behalf.\nThese entities may be located in other countries where Stratasys has no presence, and their servers may be located anywhere in the world.\nWe require these entities to agree to process such Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>6.4 Transfer to Third Parties</strong>\n<br>\n</li>\n<ul>\n<li>We send or otherwise share Personal Information to/with various third parties that help us with our business operations and help us understand how our users use the Site and Services, and to develop and improve them.\nAlso, just as with our third party hosting providers, these third parties may be based (and their servers may be located) anywhere in the world.\n</li>\n<li>The Services may not be hosted by us - all or some of the hosting is done by third party service providers that we engage.\nThis means that data you provide us or that we or third parties collect from you (including any Personal Information, information which we can use, either directly or indirectly, to identify you as a natural person, is hosted with such third party service providers on servers that they own or control.\nRegardless of where such third party service providers are located (and some are located in the US), their servers may be located anywhere in the world (including the US).\nYour data may even be replicated across multiple servers located in multiple countries.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<li>\n<strong>6.5 Merger, sale or bankruptcy</strong>\n<br>In the event that Stratasys is acquired by, or merged with, a third party entity, we may (and hereby reserve the right to) transfer or assign the Personal Information and other information we have collected or received.\nIn the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, or comparable event, we may not be able to control how your Personal Information is treated, transferred, assigned, or used.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>6.6 Enforcement</strong>\n<br>We may send or otherwise share your Personal Information with any third party if we believe that disclosure of such information is helpful or

Services, including investigations of potential violations thereof.\n</li>\n<li>detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or security issues.\nand/or</li>\n<li>protect against harm to the rights,

content that you make publicly available on or via the Site or Services (such as your Public Profile) will be publicly available to other users of the Site or such Services.\nIf you actively or passively allow your contact information to be public, you may receive unsolicited messages or activity from other users of the Site or such Services.\nWe therefore encourage you only to post
