transfer and store your information.</p>What information do we collect when you use the NHS website?<p>When you use the NHS website, we use various technologies to collect information automatically \u2013 such as your IP address.\nThis is commonplace across all internet services to enable the investigation of issues such as service availability and the identification of malicious use.\nThis information is then kept in our internet access logs.</p>\n<p>We also collect some personal information directly \u2013 for example, when you actively submit details like your postcode to find nearby services.</p>\n<p>When you log in to the NHS website, you are logging in to your NHS account.\nBy using your NHS account, you are accepting the NHS account terms and conditions, including the NHS account privacy policy and the NHS account cookies policy.\nThese will apply while you are using services within your NHS account.</p>How do we use the information we collect about you?<p>We analyse information to see what is most effective about our website and associated services to help us identify ways to improve it and to make it more effective.\nWe may also use information for other purposes, which we would describe to you at the point when we collect the information.</p>Cookies<p>Our website uses cookies.\nThese are small files saved on your phone, tablet or computer when you visit a website.\nThey store information about how you use the website, such as the pages you visit.</p>\n<p>The law states that we can store cookies on your device if they are strictly necessary for the operation of this site.\nFor all other types of cookies we need your permission before we can use them on your device.</p>\n<p>You can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>choose which cookies we use</li>\n<li>see details about the cookies we use</li>\n</ul>Video content<p>The NHS website video content \u2013 whether viewed on the website, in emails or embedded in third-party sites \u2013 are streamed to users by a third-party company, Brightcove.</p>\n<p>See the Brightcove privacy policy for more information about how they collect and use data about viewers of our videos.</p>Email subscriptions<p>If you sign up for one of our email subscription services, we will hold the information you submitted (such as your email address) for as long as we are providing you services.</p>\n<p>If you do not access the services provided by us, for instance you do not open or click through one of the emails for more than a year, we will send you an email asking you to confirm that you wish to continue receiving our emails.\nIf you do not respond to this email within 1 month we will unsubscribe you.</p>\n<p>We will remove all personal information we hold relating to you, which you registered with us, within 6 months of you unsubscribing from the site.\nWe hold this information for a further 6 months following unsubscription, as we may need to use it for statistical analysis or if you choose to resubscribe.\nBe assured that if you unsubscribe you will not receive further information from us.</p>NHS website enquiries<p>If you contact the NHS website with an enquiry, such as a question about our content, you may be contacted to provide feedback on how we managed your enquiry.\nYou will be asked for your consent when you submit your data to us.</p>\n<p>We will hold the information you provide us for as long as necessary to support the service we are providing you, for example so we can continue to provide assistance or resolve an ongoing issue.</p>\n<p>If no communication has been made in over 12 months and the information is not required to resolve an ongoing issue, then all communication and any personal information will be deleted.\nNon-personal information, such as how long your enquiry was open for or the part of the website you were using, will remain.\nThis is to allow for reporting over a period greater than 12 months.</p>\n<p>Information is kept for 12 months to allow for trend analysis, identifying reoccurring issues and understanding common issues.</p>\n<p>Exceptions include those currently following the complaints process, or when consent to keep information for longer has been obtained.\nAdditionally, if we have determined that the information supplied contains personal information that we do not need to hold to provide assistance, we will endeavour to remove this information sooner.</p>Our interactive tools<p>We produce several interactive tools that can help you learn more about your health.\nFor example, our Heart Age tool can help you find out how healthy your heart is.</p>\n<p>As well as appearing on the NHS website, these tools can be used on other (third-party) sites.</p>\n<p>If you turn on cookies that measure website use (on our cookies page), use of our tools on third-party sites will be tracked.\nNo personal data is collected by these tools.</p>\n<p>Information gathered by us includes your IP address, the page a tool is used on, and how many times it is used.\nIn some cases, tracking is used to show user progress through a tool.\nThis information will not be shared with third parties.\nAll our tools store the number of times a user has visited the tool.\nSome tools also store information about how far you got through a tool, so you do not have to restart the tool if you use it again.</p>\n<p>Some tools, such as the Heart Age tool, allow input of date of birth or postcode, which are converted to age and deprivation score.</p>Third-party services<p>If you turn on cookies that measure website use (on our cookies page) we may use the following services on the NHS website:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New Relic provides information on how well our site is working</li>\n<li>Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics and Hotjar collect information about how you use our website, to help us make it better</li>\n<li>Hotjar and Qualtrics survey tools are used to ask you questions to help us make the website better.\nThese surveys may collect both personal data and data that cannot identify you (anonymised data).\nYou will be reminded of specific details when we collect this data and your rights under this policy and legislation are not affected</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information about how these services process your data, see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New Relic privacy policy</li>\n<li>Adobe Analytics privacy policy</li>\n<li>Google Analytics privacy policy</li>\n<li>Hotjar privacy policy</li>\n<li>Qualtrics privacy policy</li>\n</ul>Syndication<p>We offer a free syndication service that enables partner organisations to pull content from the NHS website via an application programming interface (API) and display it on their website, app or service.</p>\n<p>In line with the syndication standard licence agreement, we require personal information of those using this service for contractual purposes.\nWe use the data to inform subscribers of changes to functionality, structure or features within the syndicated content, or if there is a breach of the agreement.\nWe also use subscriber's personal data to feed into internal reports, which identify active callers of the API alongside their usage.</p>\n<p>While an active subscriber is receiving syndicated content we will continue to store their personal data.\nWe will carry out an annual review to identify users who are inactive and who do not want to continue to use the service.\nWe will close accounts for these users.</p>\n<p>A user can also remove their own account without admin assistance via the API developer portal.</p>\n<p>Once an account has been closed by either the user or an admin, we will no longer store their data.</p>Service finders<p>The website provides a number of service finders to assist you in finding health services near you.\nWhile we do not capture any specific information about you as part of this service, the searches, including postcode and other personal information, are saved in our logs and analytics tools.\nIdeally we would only use part postcodes but this renders the searches ineffectual in rural areas.</p>Ratings and reviews<p>User ratings and reviews are moderated by a service called Thornacre.\nThey will receive details of any comments you make and the name and email address you submit.</p>\n<p>See the privacy policy on the Thornacre website to find out how they process your information.</p>\n<p>We also syndicate published ratings and reviews to partner websites, apps or services that adhere to the syndication standard licence terms.\nWe do not pass your email address to our syndication partners.</p>General data services<p>We process and publish data in directories on NHS.UK from data aggregators and professional bodies \u2013 for example, the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP).\nThis is to provide information to the public about health-related services.</p>Profile Information Management System (PIMS)<p>PIMS is used by staff working within dental practices, general practices, pharmacies, opticians, NHS Trusts and social care providers to enter service information on the NHS website so that it can be displayed on the website and syndicated to third parties.</p>\n<p>If you are a PIMS profile editor, we collect personal data from you on registration.\nThe personal data that we collect includes your name, email address, organisation name and job title.\nWe use your personal data to provide the PIMS service and to communicate with you by email for PIMS service related purposes.\nOccasionally we may contact you for research purposes with the objective of improving the PIMS service or the service information that we provide on the NHS website.</p>\n<p>PIMS enables you to add staff information on to your service profile(s).\nBefore doing so, you need to ensure that you acquire and record their consent unless the information is already in the public domain (for example, published on your corporate website or included in a professional body medical register).</p>Social media<p>We utilise the following social media platforms to interact with our users:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facebook (incorporating Instagram)</li>\n<li>Twitter</li>\n<li>YouTube</li>\n</ul>How the NHS website collects and stores your data<p>If you choose to interact with us on social media, we may receive some personally identifiable data about you, which is supplied by the channel you are using (for example, Facebook, Twitter or YouTube).\nThis may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>name</li>\n<li>social media handles (such as Twitter account name)</li>\n<li>location history (where you are contacting us from)</li>\n<li>images (such as your profile picture)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will process and store your data in accordance with the terms and conditions and privacy policy of the platform in question.\nYou should be aware that your use of these platforms is governed by the terms and conditions agreed between you and the platform, rather than the NHS website.</p>\n<p>We may use social media management tools (such as Hootsuite) to help deliver elements of our service to you.\nAny personally identifiable data processed using these tools is supplied by the platforms we use, in accordance with their terms and conditions.</p>\n<p>We will not remove, duplicate or transfer your personal data from or between any of the social platforms that we use, except for when you give us explicit permission to do so or when we believe that we need to in order to respond to an urgent risk to health.</p>\n<p>For example, if you interact with us in a way that raises serious concerns about your mental health, we may share your personal details with local NHS services to ensure that you are offered appropriate support.</p>\n<p>You should be aware that social networks may control some of the data associated with interactions between you (the user) and us (the NHS website) on their platforms.\nFor example, we will be able to delete our own records of a private message conversation if you request us to do so, but social networks may store a copy of this conversation that we are unable to access.</p>\n<p>We would recommend using the privacy tools built in to the social networks in question to ensure you are able to exercise your rights appropriately.</p>Understanding how social networks use your data<p>Social networks use information about your online activity to build a profile of you.\nThis data is then used (anonymously) to send you targeted adverts across various digital platforms.</p>\n<p>You should be aware that interacting with health-related accounts such as ours may help build the profile of you that social networks maintain, and could potentially result in you receiving adverts related to health issues.</p>\n<p>This process of collecting data for advertising purposes is not controlled by the NHS website, and we do not have access to the profiling data stored by social networks about you.</p>How long do we hold this information?<p>Unless otherwise stated, business information that falls under NHS Digital is held for a minimum of 3 years and will be subject to review.\nWe will hold the information for as long as we are providing you services.</p>Do we share information?<ul>\n<li>we strive to capture the minimal amount of personal data, and only share with other organisations where the law permits us to do so or where we require and have gained your consent</li>\n<li>we only share information with our authorised Data Processors for the sole purpose of processing the data in connection with the service we have procured from them.\nThese processors must act at all times on our instructions as the Data Controller under the Data Protection legislation</li>\n<li>we do not sell individuals' information</li>\n<li>we host health information campaigns on behalf of the Department of Health and Social Care, where we are Data Processors.\nThese campaigns may have separate privacy terms and consent requirements</li>\n<li>before you submit any information, you will be informed why we are asking for specific information and it is up to you whether you provide it</li>\n</ul>How can you access, amend or withdraw the personal data you have given us?<p>To get in touch about these rights, please contact us via the Data Controller details above.\nWe will seek to deal with your request without undue delay, and in any event within 1 month (subject to any extensions to which we are lawfully entitled).</p>\n<p>*Please note that we may keep a record of your communications to help us resolve any issues that you raise.</p>Right to object<ul>\n<li>if we are using your data because we have a legal basis to do so under the Health and Social Care Act, and you do not agree, you have the right to object.\nWe will respond to your request within the required time frame (although we may be allowed to extend this period in certain cases).\nGenerally, we will only disagree with you if certain limited conditions apply</li>\n<li>this right enables you to object to us processing your personal data where we do so for one of the following reasons: (i) to enable us to perform a public task or exercise official authority.\n(ii) to send you direct marketing communications.\nand (iii) for research or analytical purposes</li>\n</ul>Right to withdraw consent<p>Where we have obtained your consent to process your personal data, or consent to send you information, you may withdraw your consent at any time and we will cease to carry out the particular activity that you previously consented to, unless we consider that there is an alternative reason to justify our continued processing of your data for this purpose, in which case we will inform you of this condition.</p>Data access requests<p>You may ask us to confirm what information we hold about you at any time, and request us to modify, update or delete such information.\nWe may ask you to verify your identity and for more information about your request.</p>\n<p>If we provide you with access to the information we hold about you, we will not charge you for this.\nIf we refuse your request for any legitimate reason, we will always tell you the reasons for doing so.</p>Right to remove<p>In certain situations, you have the right to request us to \"remove\" your personal data.\nWe will respond to your request within the agreed timeframe (although we may be allowed to extend this period in certain cases) and will only disagree with you if certain limited conditions apply.</p>\n<p>If we do agree to your request, we will delete your data but will generally assume that you would prefer us to keep a note of your name on a register of individuals who would prefer not to be contacted.\nThat way, we will minimise the chances of you being contacted in the future where your data is collected in unconnected circumstances.\nIf you would prefer us not to do this, you are free to say so.</p>\n<p>Normally, the information must meet one of the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which we originally collected and/or processed it</li>\n<li>where previously given, you have withdrawn your consent to us processing your data, and there is no other valid reason for us to continue processing</li>\n<li>the data has been processed unlawfully (i.e.\nin a manner that does not comply with existing Data Protection regulations)</li>\n<li>it is necessary for the data to be deleted for us to comply with our legal obligations as a data controller</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We would only be entitled to refuse to comply with your request for one of the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to exercise the right of freedom of expression and information</li>\n<li>to comply with legal obligations or for the performance of a public interest task or exercise of official authority</li>\n<li>for public health reasons in the public interest</li>\n<li>for archival, research or statistical purposes</li>\n<li>to exercise or defend a legal claim.\nWhen complying with a valid request for the removal of data, we will take all reasonably practicable steps to delete the relevant data</li>\n</ul>Right to restrict processing<p>You have the right to request that we restrict our processing of your personal data in certain circumstances.</p>\n<p>This means that we can only continue to store your data and will not be able to carry out any further processing activities with it until either: (i) one of the circumstances listed below is resolved.\n(ii) you consent.\nor (iii) further processing is necessary for either the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, the protection of the rights of another individual, or reasons of important public interest.</p>\n<p>The circumstances in which you are entitled to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>where you dispute the accuracy of the personal data that we are processing about you.\nIn this case, our processing of your personal data will be restricted for the period during which the accuracy of the data is verified</li>\n<li>where you object to our processing of your personal data for our legitimate interests.\nHere, you can request that the data be restricted while we verify our grounds for processing your personal data</li>\n<li>where our processing of your data is unlawful, but you would prefer us to restrict our processing of it rather than erasing it</li>\n<li>where we have no further need to process your personal data but you require the data to establish, exercise or defend legal claims</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we have shared your personal data with third parties, we will notify them about the restricted processing unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort.\nWe will, of course, notify you before lifting any restriction on processing your personal data.</p>Right to rectification<p>You also have the right to request that we rectify any inaccurate or incomplete personal data that we hold about you.\nIf we have shared this personal data with third parties, we will notify them about the rectification unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort.</p>\n<p>Where appropriate, we will also tell you which third parties we have disclosed the inaccurate or incomplete personal data to.\nWhere we think that it is reasonable for us not to comply with your request, we will explain our reasons for this decision.</p>Purpose and legal basis for processing<p>NHS Digital operates the NHS website as directed by the Electronic Prescription Service, Health and Social Care Network, N3, NHS e-Referral Service, Secondary Use Service (SUS), Spine 2 (Named Programmes) Directions 2016 under the powers of sections 254(1) and (6), 274(2), 304(9) and (10) of the Health and Social Care Act 2012.</p>\n<p>This direction supplements the Health and Social Care Information Centre (Systems Delivery Functions for the NHS website and Additional Systems Delivery Functions for the NHS website) Directions 2013.</p>Keeping information secure<p>We invest significant resources to protect your personal information, from loss, misuse, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.\nHowever, no

health organisation, we will consider this on its merits.</p>Research quality and content<p>Research requests must be relevant to the NHS website programme as set out in the service proposition about the NHS website.\nWhen you submit your research support request, please outline its relevance to the service propositions and any possible benefits it may bring.</p>\n<p>You'll need to provide a

participants</li>\n<li>research outputs and dissemination</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The detailed description should be included even where the request is solely to recruit research participants.\nThis is to maintain compliance with current data protection regulations.\nWe also have a duty of care to site users, who need to be reassured that their confidentiality is protected.</p>\n<p>The NHS website user research lead has the right to comment on the suitability of the research and veto surveys or proposals that do not meet the required standard.\nWritten feedback on the reasons an application is rejected will be provided.</p>\n<p>The NHS website user research lead will have the right to comment on or amend any elements of the research instruments (for example, tools for data collection, such as questionnaires) posted on the NHS website.</p>Privacy and data security<p>The NHS website is careful to take appropriate steps to maintain the security of site users' data on our service.</p>\n<p>We require that all organisations planning to conduct research among our site users have a suitable privacy and data security policy that is compliant with existing general data protection regulations (GDPR).\nThis policy will need to be included with the request.</p>Resource requirement<p>An assessment of the resource required from the NHS website team will be made when requests are submitted.\nThose deemed to need too much resource will be rejected unless there is a clear business need for that project to be supported.</p>Research findings<p>Supported organisations will ensure the findings are published and accessible to the public.</p>\n<p>All organisations given this research support will credit the support given by the NHS website programme in any report they

"text": " Reviews policy <p>The NHS website has a number of areas where you can contribute to the site.\nYou can review and rate almost any NHS service, including hospitals, GP practices and dentists.\nWe welcome feedback, whether you, a friend or a family member were a patient, a customer or just visiting.</p>\n<p>Contributions to this website are moderated, meaning they are checked to make sure they do not break our rules before they are published.\nWe employ the services of a trusted third party to help us do this.\nYou will need to keep your contributions constructive, relevant and civil.\nThe rules and guidelines below are to protect both you and the NHS, and our moderators will not publish contributions they deem to break the rules.</p>\n<p>Should you have further questions, or would like to raise a complaint, please get in touch with our Service Desk team via our feedback form.</p>\n<p>The service you receive from the NHS in England will never be adversely affected by your feedback on hospitals, GP surgeries, dental practices or any other health provider and you can review anonymously if you wish.\nYou should respect the anonymity of other patients and staff at the service you are reviewing by not using their names or any descriptors that may identify the individual.</p>\n<p>The \"Leave review\" feature available on many NHS service provider profiles on the NHS website allows you to review the service you received, or the service you witnessed a friend or a family member receiving.\nThis is not a formal complaint procedure and if you wish to make a complaint you should read our guide to making a complaint.</p>\n<p>NHS trusts and the service providers are not obliged to read or respond to review, though many do.\nIf you want a reply to your feedback you should contact the provider of the NHS service directly or alternatively contact the commissioner of the service.\nNHS England is responsible for purchasing primary care services such as GPs, dentists, pharmacists, optical services and some specialised services.\nYour local integrated care board (ICB) is responsible for secondary care including hospital treatments, emergency care and some community services, like district nursing.</p>\n<p>You can leave a review for NHS or private healthcare if the service provider offers both NHS and private treatment on their premises.</p>\n<p>You can leave a review about any aspect of your experience using an NHS service.\nThis includes feedback on your medical care and clinical staff, as well as on the wider NHS environment, service and supporting staff you encountered.</p>\n<p>Feedback should be made within the \"Leave review\" area of the NHS service provider profile page.\nThis area is not suitable for making general political points about NHS services.\nFeedback from members of staff will not be accepted.\nService providers may promote the ratings and reviews service and encourage you to leave reviews.&nbsp.\nIf service providers are promoting the ratings and review service they must do so equally and openly and must not ask about the content of your review, make any aspect of your care conditional upon you giving a review (or the content of it) or solicit positive only reviews.&nbsp;Service providers must not post reviews on behalf of patients, their friends or family members.</p>\n<p>Ratings and reviews must be about events within the past 2 years.\nOnce the event described in a review we've published is more than 2 years old, it is removed from the service's profile, along with any associated ratings and information.</p>\n<p>If you think someone's contribution to the website breaks our rules you can alert one of our moderators by selecting the \"Report as unsuitable\" link directly beneath the review.\nReporting a review will not delete it but will temporarily remove it and ensure we look at it as soon as possible.\nThe moderators will then decide whether to remove it permanently or reinstate it.</p>\n<p>The NHS website does not remove reviews in situations where organisations and reviewers disagree about the facts disclosed in a review.\nOur policy is to be impartial and it is not possible to determine what happened or who is right about the reviewer's experience.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Relevance</b>: reviews must be relevant to the experience of care with the associated provider.\nWhen reviewing a particular service provider, you should ensure your review only references that provider.\nIf your experience involves other service providers, you should leave a review on each provider detailing their part in the experience.</p>\n<p>You may reference other service providers within your review for feedback context, however, you should not name them.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Be civil</b>: please ensure that your contributions are respectful of others.\nWe will remove contributions that are unlawful, harassing, abusive, threatening, obscene, sexually suggestive, racist, homophobic or sexist, or that incite or promote hatred of any group or individual.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Writing in capitals</b>: do not overuse capital letters \u2013 on the internet this can be regarded as \"shouting\" and people may find it offensive.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Be informative</b>: ensure your review has enough information to describe your experience, and if you're reviewing a hospital, GP practice, dental practice or community NHS service, provide enough information to assist someone else in making decisions about the service.\nReviews deemed uninformative by our moderators may not be published.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Abusive language</b>: reviews containing swearing will not be published.</p>\n<p>\n<b>English</b>: all reviews on the website must be made in English.\nReviews in other languages will not be published.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Stereotypes</b>: reviews that stereotype sections of society will not be published.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Multiple posts</b>: duplicate reviews or repeats will not be published.\nUsers should only post one review per experience.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Use of emojis:</b> do not submit any reviews containing emojis.\nThere's a risk they could be misinterpreted by other users of the site.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Complaint investigations:</b> reviews mentioning or describing an investigation into a complaint with an NHS service will not be published.\nThis includes past, current and future investigations.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Moderation decisions:</b> comments about a previous decision not to publish a review will not be published.\nReviews must only describe a person's experience of using an NHS service.</p>\n<p>Your review can be about any experience you had in the building that you visited.\nFor example, a physiotherapist you visit may be renting a room at a GP surgery.\nIn this case you would review them on the GP surgery page.</p>\n<p>The NHS website uses a trusted third party (called Thornacre) to provide moderation services, subject to a contract with us.\nThis company is based in the UK and is required to keep your details confidential and secure, in keeping with our own privacy policy.</p>\n<p>For the NHS website to publish your review you will need to be either logged in to your NHS website account or provide a valid email address where we can contact you.\nWhen you submit your review, we will also see your IP address.\nThese details are kept confidential and will be used by NHS staff and the moderation service provider to process your submission.\nThe NHS website uses your email address to contact you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to let you know your review has been published, or if it has breached this policy</li>\n<li>if we need to clarify an aspect of your review</li>\n<li>if your review gives us cause for concern about your wellbeing or that of someone else.\nWe may send you information about how to access appropriate support</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The NHS website will only use your details for the purposes of dealing with your enquiry, training, quality monitoring or evaluating the services we provide.\nWe will not pass on your details to anyone else without your express permission except in exceptional circumstances.\nExamples of this might include anyone reporting serious self-harm or posing a threat to others, or children contacting us and sharing serious issues.</p>\n<p>We do not publish reviews on the NHS website that state someone is intending to self-harm or end their life.\nWe also do not publish reviews that describe methods of self-harm or suicide because this information could be harmful to others.\nGo to your nearest A&amp;E if you're feeling suicidal or thinking about self-harming.</p>\n<p>Whether you are speaking for yourself, a friend or a family member, do not name the individuals you are talking about.\nIf you're leaving a review on another person's behalf, it is best to talk of \"my husband\" or \"my uncle\" and so on to help protect their privacy.</p>Personal information<p>To help protect your privacy, any information you contribute that reveals personal information, such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, Twitter handles, addresses and so on will be removed.\nAny posts attempting to use the site to exchange personal information or arrange meetings with another user will not be published.</p>\n<p>The personal information you share will be held by us for up to 2 years so that we can get in touch with you about what you have written and so you can contact us to change or remove your review.\nWhen we remove the review from our site due to the events occurring over 2 years ago, we also remove all the personal information we hold in connection with it.</p>\n<p>When you write a review and wish to remain anonymous we will not publish your personal details on the website or pass them to the organisation you are reviewing, except in the exceptional circumstances described above.\nYou should be aware your reviews may allow the provider to guess who you are even when you post anonymously.\nWe do not allow the provider to reveal your identity in any response they submit for publication on this website.</p>\n<p>Names used on the NHS website are moderated.\nWhen selecting a name to be displayed on the website make sure you choose one that is not rude, offensive or aimed at impersonating another person.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Naming businesses</b>: please avoid naming businesses or commercial services in your review.\nAny reviews breaching this rule will not be published.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Under-16s</b>: if you're under 16 ensure you have permission from a parent or guardian before posting on the NHS website.</p>\n<p>Reviews that glamourise smoking, drug use or drinking, or that promote a poor moral example will be removed.</p>\n<p>Asking for and giving specific medical or health advice is not permitted.</p>\n<p>Reviews deemed to be advertising a product or service will not be published.</p>\n<p>We may remove reviews that reference specific medical products or medicines if the context is not appropriate.</p>\n<p>Irrespective of their contents, we will not publish any reviews if we know or reasonably suspect they have been made following financial or any other inducement.\nby service providers or members of staff.\nor subject to undue influence from service providers.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Current court cases and court injunctions</b>: contempt of court rules mean you cannot leave reviews that could prejudice the outcome of a court case or General Medical Council hearing.\nReviews about something that subsequently becomes the subject of a court case or hearing will also be removed if they risk being in contempt of court.\nContributions that break a court injunction will be removed.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Clinical negligence or criminal activity</b>: reviews that give an account of clinical negligence will not be published.\nIf you have an allegation of clinical negligence please use the NHS complaints procedure.\nAccusations of criminal activity will not be published.\nIf you believe that criminal activity is or has taken place at an organisation please contact the police or the organisation directly.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Defamation</b>: defamation is a complex area.\nDefamation may occur when someone makes a statement that causes serious harm to a person's reputation.\nThe law allows you to post reviews containing your honestly held opinion, provided you identify the facts on which you are expressing your opinion.\nPosting untrue statements is against the law if they cause serious harm to a person's reputation or are likely to do so.\nWe remove reviews where we judge there is not a lawful basis for their publication.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Disclaimer</b>: this definition is not to be regarded as a statement of the law nor should it be relied upon to make any judgement as to whether content is potentially defamatory.\nIt is up to you to decide whether to take specific legal advice.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Threats</b>: reviews containing threats of public fear, terrorism or threats towards any individual are not permitted.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Copyright</b>: ensure that you own the copyright to any material you put on the site \u2013 especially if you have copied it from another source.\nIf we're in doubt about the ownership of content we will remove it from the site.</p> Copyright of your contributions<p>Your contributions to the NHS website are published to the general public.\nIn submitting your reviews you assign all rights to the NHS website for use and publication of your contribution (further information can be found in terms and conditions).\nIf you're unwilling to grant the NHS website copyright to your contribution you should not submit it to the site.</p>Action we may take<p>A breach of any of our rules can lead to your review being rejected.\nRepeated or serious breaches of our rules may lead to the NHS website blocking contributions from your email address or suspending your NHS website account.\nThe NHS website reserves the right to delete any content at any time for any reason and is under no obligation to publish any contributions.\nThe NHS website reserves the right to alter or update the house rules or terms and conditions at any time.</p>\n<p> Page last reviewed: 14 April
