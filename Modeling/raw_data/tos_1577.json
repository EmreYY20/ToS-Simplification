arbitrator, either Party may petition a court with proper jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to a process whereby the court provides the Parties with a panel of five potential arbitrators meeting the requirements herein for an arbitrator, each Party strikes one arbitrator, and the court appoints the arbitrator from the remaining arbitrators on the panel based on the arbitrator\u2019s qualifications and expertise, and the requirements of this Agreement.\nFor purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and-confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who

fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith.\nIf we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law).</p>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>16.7</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>\n<b>Small Claims Court Claims.</b> Notwithstanding the parties' agreement to resolve all

them.</p>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>16.9</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>\n<b>Dispute Resolution Only If A Tribunal Has Ruled That Arbitration Is Prohibited.</b> If a court with appropriate jurisdiction prohibits arbitration of a dispute in accordance with this Section 16, then the state or federal courts in New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the dispute, and to the maximum extent permitted by the mandatory laws in your country of residence, these Terms and any dispute arising out of or related in any way to these Terms or their subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes),

is not personal information (\"non-personal information\"), including information lawfully made available from federal, state, or local government records, or aggregate or de-identified information.\nBecause non-personal information does not personally identify you, we may collect, use, and disclose such information for any purpose permitted by law.\u202fIn some instances, we may combine non-personal information with personal information.\nIf we combine any non-personal information with personal information, the combined information will be treated by us as personal information.</p>\n<p>The Properties may offer features that allow you to post content.\nYou should be aware that personal information which you voluntarily include and transmit online in a publicly accessible blog, forum, social network, or otherwise online may be viewed and used by others.\nAs a general reminder, please think carefully before you decide to put anything on the Internet.\nFor example, if you voluntarily disclose personal information in chat areas or bulletin boards (e.g., comment sections), that information could be seen and used by others, and may result in unsolicited messages from others.\nWe are not responsible for the information you may choose to submit in these public forums.\nTo request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, please contact us using the information provided in the section titled Contacting Us.\nIn some cases, for legal retention purposes or technical limitations (e.g., the data may not be searchable), we may not be able to remove personal information voluntarily disclosed by you in such forums, in which case, we will notify you.</p>\n<p>With respect to how we use Service Data, we use that information to provide Services to our clients.</p>\n<p>\n</p> HOW WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION <p>In addition to using your personal information ourselves, we may send your personal information and other information to other companies, affiliates, and third parties in the following instances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Service Providers</strong>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may share your personal information with service providers who may use your information to provide us services including, but not limited to: website hosting, data analysis, infrastructure provision, information technology services, conducting surveys and contests, customer service, email or SMS delivery services, payment processing and recouping, auditing, consulting, magazine management and shipping, event management, data security, and anti-fraud monitoring.\nThese service providers have access to personal information that is necessary to perform their functions, and are prohibited from using your personal information for any other purpose.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Corporate Affiliates</strong>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may share personal information with our corporate affiliates and subsidiaries, who process personal information on our behalf as our vendor, where necessary to provide a product or service that you have requested or in other circumstances with your consent or as permitted or required by law.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Business and Advertising Partners</strong>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may share personal information with our business partners, which may include information shared for the purposes of marketing or interest-based advertising.\nIf you provide any user information via an advertiser promotion, please be aware you are directly providing your user information to that advertiser.</p>\n<p>We may share certain event registrant user information with sponsors of our live or virtual events (e.g., attendee name, title, company name) or with Forbes licensees in circumstances where a licensee works with Forbes in the promotion or such an event, subject to applicable law.</p>\n<p>We share certain personal information of certain Forbes list nominees and honorees with our third-party partners in situations where Forbes partners with a third-party in connection with the creation of such lists.\nIn such circumstances, the third party will be named.</p>\n<p>For Service Data processed on behalf of our clients, like lead generation data or data collected in connection with a survey conducted for a client, we share the Service Data with our clients.</p>\n<p>We also make certain information about our print magazine subscribers available for list renters to engage in direct, physical mail marketing, but in such circumstances, no personal information is actually made available to the renter.\nForbes also shares certain personal information about its print magazine subscribers with other publishers in connection with data co-ops.\nYou can modify your related user information by contacting Forbes as indicated in the section <em>\n<strong>Your Choices</strong>\n</em> below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Legal Compliance and to Defend Our Rights</strong>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may disclose personal information and other information as we believe necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence.\n(b) to comply with legal process.\n(c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government authorities outside your country of residence.\n(d) to enforce our Terms and Conditions.\n(e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates.\n(f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you, or others.\nand (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Business Transfers</strong>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may share your personal information and other information with third parties in connection with a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of the assets of the Company, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which information held by the Company about our Properties users is among the assets transferred.\nIn this case, we may notify you if applicable law requires.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Consent</strong>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Forbes may disclose your Personal Information to third parties with your consent or pursuant to your direction.</p> DATA SECURITY <p>We care about the protection of your personal information and use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to do so.\u202fThese measures are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing of your personal information.\u202f</p>\n<p>Your user information is stored on Forbes servers located in the United States.\nWe use industry standard physical, electronic, and organizational safeguards to protect your user information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy.\nWe employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside of the company.\nWe also ensure that, in accordance with good industry practice, we have in place security measures to protect your personal information from interception, including in transit between our different systems and devices.\nThis includes having in place network protection to deny attackers the ability to intercept data and the encryption of your personal information while in transit to deny attackers the ability to read data.</p>\n<p>Of course, it's important to keep in mind that no data transmission on the Internet is guaranteed to be 100% secure.\nIf you are concerned that your privacy may have been breached or that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us as provided below.</p>\n<p>\n</p> DATA RETENTION <p>We will retain your user information for as long as we have an ongoing legitimate business need to use your user information (for example you have an active account with us or to comply with applicable tax, legal, or accounting requirements).\nWhen there is no longer such a need, we will delete it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in back-up archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.\nWe will also delete certain user information we may retain about you upon your request.</p>\n<p>\n</p> INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING <ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Targeted Advertising / Behavioral Advertising</strong>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may ourselves, or with third-party vendors, use personal information to deliver targeted advertising to you when you visit other websites or our Properties (including emails).\nCookies, clickstream data, and other similar technologies described above may be used in this process.\nFor example, if you are searching for information on a particular product, we or our vendor may cause an advertisement to appear on other websites you view with information on that product.\nThis form of advertising, sometimes called \"targeted advertising,\" \"behavioral advertising,\" or \"cross-context behavioral advertising,\" enables us and our vendors to know your interests in connection with the delivery of that specific ad.\nWe believe that such advertising is helpful because you will see advertisements that are relevant to your interests.\nWe comply with the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising as administered by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA).\nIf you would like to opt out of these interest-based advertisements, please follow the opt-out process described below under <em>\n<strong>Your Choices</strong>\n</em>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Cross Device Matching</strong>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may use information we have collected to help us, or our third-party vendors, determine if you have interacted with our Properties across multiple devices and to match such devices.\nTo accomplish this, we may rely on information (including demographic, geographic, and interest-based data) from third parties such as data vendors, pursuant to their own privacy policies, or we may use information we collect in conjunction with such third-party data.\nBased on this data, we may then display targeted advertisements across devices that we believe are associated and may provide other services to our advertisers to better enable cross-device targeting and analysis.\nFor further instructions on restricting our use of certain cross-device data, please see Your Choices below.</p>\n<p>\n</p> YOUR CHOICES <p>Consistent with applicable law, you may exercise the options described in this section regarding your choices with respect to your personal information and communications from us.\nYou may also have certain additional rights available depending on your state or country of residence, as described further below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Rights and Opt-Outs</strong>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Registered forbes.com users may at any time change the information stored in their forbes.com member profile (such as name, password, location, country, and the topics and authors they are following) by visiting their member profile page.\nYou may also request to delete or modify your personal account and/or any personal information you may have voluntarily submitted to us (e.g., information that you provide to register for a Forbes event) if you wish to do so, provided we are able to verify your identity in accordance with applicable law.</p>\n<p>You may also ask to opt out of direct email marketing and SMS communications from Forbes by following the unsubscribe instructions contained in the communication you have received.\nFor marketing emails, this is typically through an \"unsubscribe\" or \"opt-out\" link.\nTo opt out of other forms of marketing, please contact us using the information provided in the section titled <em>\n<strong>Contacting Us</strong>\n</em> below.</p>\n<p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, California, Virginia, or the People's Republic of China, you may have additional rights as set forth in the subsequent sections of this Privacy Statement.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies, Tracking, and Interest-Based Advertising</strong>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you would like to stop or restrict the placement of cookies or flush any cookies that may already be on your computer or device, please refer to and adjust your web browser preferences.\nFurther information on cookies is available at www.allaboutcookies.org.\nBy deleting our cookies or disabling future cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas or features of our Properties or some of the functionality may be affected.</p>\n<p>The online advertising industry provides a service through which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from certain data partners and other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs.\nYou can opt out of targeted advertising from certain providers that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) program at\u202fwww.aboutads.info/consumers.\nOther providers are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, and you can opt out of interest-based advertising by those members by visiting http://optout.networkadvertising.org/.\nPlease note that by opting out, you may continue to see generic advertising that is not tailored to your specific interests and activities.</p>\n<p>Cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted out.\u202fFor example, if you have opted out on your device browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device, and if you opt out on one of your devices, that opt out may not be effective on all of your devices.</p>\n<p>For targeted advertisements delivered through mobile apps, you can install the DAA's AppChoices app on your device to opt out of targeted advertising by certain providers, and can also select a system-level advertising preference on your device (such as \"Limit Ad Tracking\" on Apple devices or \"Opt-out of Interest-Based Ads\" on Android devices).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Do Not Track</strong>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While some browsers have a \"do not track\" (also known as DNT) feature that lets you instruct websites not to track your online activities, we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>PRIVACY DISCLOSURES FOR NEVADA RESIDENTS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you are a resident of Nevada, you have the right to opt out of the sale of certain personal information to third parties who intend to license or sell that personal information.\nIf you wish to exercise this right, click here or contact us at 866-536-7262.</p>\n<p>\n</p> CROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS <p>If you submit personal information to Forbes, your personal information may be processed in a foreign country where privacy laws may be less stringent than the laws in your country.\nBy submitting your personal information to us you agree to the transfer, storage, and processing of your personal information in a country other than your country of residence including, but not necessarily limited to, the United States.\nPlease note that personal information transferred to the United States is subject to access by law enforcement.</p>\n<p>Where applicable, Forbes may use model clauses approved by the laws of your jurisdiction (such as Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission) for cross-border data transfers.\u202f</p>\n<p>\n</p> LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUESTS <p>Forbes takes the protection of your personal information very seriously and is committed to acting as a responsible data custodian.\nIf we become aware that any law enforcement, regulatory, judicial or governmental authority (\"Authority\") wishes to obtain access to, or a copy of, the personal information that we hold about you (whether on a voluntary or mandatory basis) (a \"Request\"), then we commit to the following: (1) we will investigate the Request before responding, to ensure that it is a valid request made under applicable law.\nand (2) we will only disclose personal information to the Authority in response to the Request where we are legally required to do so and in accordance with applicable lawful process.\nThe only exception to these commitments is where we reasonably believe (in good faith) that the urgent provision of the requested personal information per the Authority's Request is necessary to prevent an imminent risk of serious harm to any individual.\nHowever, in any event, we shall never knowingly disclose personal information in a massive, disproportionate, or indiscriminate manner, which goes beyond what is necessary in a democratic society.</p>\n<p>\n</p> CHILDREN'S PRIVACY <p>The Properties are intended for people who are at least 16 years of age.\u202fIf you are less than 16 years old, please do not send any personal information to us\u2014including information such as your name, address, or email address.\nWe do not knowingly collect (nor do we wish to collect) any personal information from children under the age of 16.\u202fIf we learn we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 16, we will delete that information from our database and terminate the corresponding account, if any.\nWe encourage you to discuss the Properties with your parent or guardian.</p>\n<p>\n</p> CHANGES TO THIS POLICY <p>We may update this Privacy Statement from time to time in response to changing legal, technical or business developments.\nThis Privacy Statement describes our data handling practices for the 12 months prior to the date on which it was last updated.\nWe reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this Privacy Statement at any time, provided that any such modifications will only be applied prospectively.\nWe encourage you to periodically review the Site for the latest information on our privacy practices.\nYour continued use of the Properties following the posting of any changes to this Privacy Statement means you accept such changes.</p>\n<p>Note on Translated Version(s): For your convenience, Forbes may make translated versions of this Privacy Statement available on the Site.\nIn the event that the terms of any such translated version conflict with the terms of the English version, the terms of the English version of this Privacy Statement will apply.</p>\n<p>\n</p> CONTACTING US&lt.\n<p>If you have any other

California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, provides you with specific rights regarding your Personal Information.\nThis section describes the rights that California consumers have and explains how to

government records.\n(ii) de-identified or aggregated data.\nor (iii) information excluded from the scope of the CCPA.\nTo be clear, these rights are granted only to the extent that you are a

to the applicable Personal Information.</p>\n<p>In order to provide our Services to our clients, we may process Service Data that we receive from or on behalf of our clients.\nIf you are a California resident, you may have certain CCPA rights pertaining to such information.\nUnder the CCPA, when we act as a \"service provider\" (not as a \"business\" or a \"third party\") over such information, we only process your information through our Services as necessary to provide our services to our clients, at our clients' direction.\nIf you wish to exercise any of your rights under CCPA regarding such

that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Request restriction of processing of your personal data.\nThis

use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.\nWe will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.\nNote that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.\nHowever, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.\nIf you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.\nWe will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To exercise your rights under the GDPR, click here or contact us by using the information in the Contacting Us section in the Privacy Statement.\nPlease note that in order for you to assert these rights, we may need to verify your identity to confirm your right to
