voluntarily provide us with information, you consent to our collection, use and disclosure of the information that you provide.\nII.\nINFORMATION WE COLLECT <b>Our Goal Is To Not Know Who You Are</b>\n<br>\n<br> To protect our hinds, we will state: We may collect both \u201cNon-Personal Information\u201d and \u201cPersonal Information\u201d about you.\n<br>\n<br>\n<li>\u201cNon-Personal Information\u201d includes information that cannot be directly used to personally identify you, such as basic browser information (Ex.\nFirefox on Linux) This is standard on most hosting services, and we\u2019ve disabled everything we can to collect as little as possible in addition to choosing a host known to respect user privacy - Orange Website.</li>\n<br>\n<br>\n<li>\u201cPersonal Information\u201d includes information that can be used to personally identify you, such as your name and email address.\nThis is never collected unless you optionally communicate with us by email or another contact method.\nWe don't typically verify the information supplied, so you have every ability to use aliases when contacting us.\nWe have several recommendations for aliasing services in our resources.</li>\n<br>\n<br>\n<li>We do not utilize cookies, we don't track you through scripts, and we do not implement trackers on our website to analyze your behavior.\nThe only exception to this is our YouTube content embedded on this website which may have the indirect ability of tracking users.\nWe recommend using browser tools to block trackers that may be used by the embedded tool if this concerns you - or alternatively you may disable Javascript, though this may break some other tools on our site.</li> III.\nHOW WE USE AND SHARE INFORMATION <b>We do not sell, trade, rent or share your Personal Information we collect with third parties.\nPeriod.\nYour data stays with us and only us.</b>\n<br>\n<br>\n<li>In rare scenarios, a third-party may be involved in handling your information to provide a Service.\nGenerally, these third-parties will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the required services.\nWe always attempt to offer safer alternatives to users when available.</li>\n<br>\n<br>\n<li>It's important to mention certain third-party service providers, such as payment processors, have their own privacy policies we have no control over.\nWe recommend you read their privacy policies so that you can understand the manner in which your Personal Information will be handled by such providers.\nWe aim to offer more private alternatives to users when the option is available.</li>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>In regards to how your information is used, the answer is simply to perform the Service you require.\nUnlike most companies, we don't have anything to gain from your data.</b> IV.\nHOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION We implement strong precautions to protect your Personal Information to our best ability.\nWhile we cannot guarantee your information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by a breach of such precautions, we are doing everything in our power to prevent it from happening.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>By using our Service, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to this risk.</b> V.\nLINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES As part of our Service, we may provide links to other websites or applications.\nWe are

may not submit content to the forum containing malicious computer code, such as computer viruses or spyware.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You may not submit content to the forum as a mere placeholder, to hold a particular address, user name, or other unique identifier.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You may not use the forum to disclose information that you don\u2019t have the right to disclose, like others\u2019

features of the forum.</p>\n<p>To create an account, you must provide some information about yourself.\nIf you create an account, you agree to provide, at a minimum, a valid e-mail address, and to keep that address up-to-date.\nYou may close your account at any time by e-mailing support@techlore.tech.</p>\n<p>You agree to be responsible for all action taken using your account, whether authorized by you or not, until you either close your account or notify the company that your account has been compromised.\nYou agree to notify the company immediately if you suspect your account has been compromised.\nYou agree to select a secure password for your account, and keep it secret.</p>\n<p>The company may restrict, suspend, or close your account on the forum according to its policy for handling copyright-related takedown requests, or if the company reasonably believes that you\u2019ve broken any rule in these terms.</p>\nYour Content\n<p>Nothing in these terms gives the company any ownership rights in intellectual property that you share with the forum, such as your account information, posts, or other content you submit to the forum.\nNothing in these terms gives you any ownership rights in the company\u2019s intellectual property, either.</p>\n<p>Between you and the company, you remain solely responsible for content you submit to the forum.\nYou agree not to wrongly imply that content you submit to the forum is sponsored or approved by the company.\nThese terms do not obligate the company to store, maintain, or provide copies of content you submit, and to change it, according to these terms.</p>\n<p>Content you submit to the forum belongs to you, and you decide what permission to give others for it.\nBut at a minimum, you license the company to provide content that you submit to the forum to other users of the forum.\nThat special license allows the company to copy, publish, and analyze content you submit to the forum.</p>\n<p>When content you submit is removed from the forum, whether by you or by the company, the company\u2019s special license ends when the last copy disappears from the company\u2019s backups, caches, and other systems.\nOther licenses you apply to content you submit, such as Creative Commons licenses, may continue after your content is removed.\nThose licenses may give others, or the company itself, the right to share your content through the forum again.</p>\n<p>Others who receive content you submit to the forum may violate the terms on which you license your content.\nYou agree that the company will not be liable to you for those violations or their consequences.</p>\nYour Responsibility\n<p>You agree to indemnify the company from legal claims by others related to your breach of these terms, or breach of these terms by others using your account on the forum.\nBoth you and the company agree to notify the other side of any legal claims for which you might have to indemnify the company as soon as possible.\nIf the company fails to notify you of a legal claim promptly, you won\u2019t have to indemnify the company for damages that you could have defended against or mitigated with prompt notice.\nYou agree to allow the company to control investigation, defense, and settlement of legal claims for which you would have to indemnify the company, and to cooperate with those efforts.\nThe company agrees not to agree to any settlement that admits fault for you or imposes obligations on you without your prior agreement.</p>\nDisclaimers\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>You accept all risk of using the forum and content on the forum.\nAs far as the law allows, the company and its suppliers provide the forum as is, without any warranty whatsoever.</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>The forum may hyperlink to and integrate forums and services run by others.\nThe company does not make any warranty about services run by others, or content they may provide.\nUse of services run by others may be governed by other terms between you and the one running service.</p>\nLimits on Liability\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Neither the company nor its suppliers will be liable to you for breach-of-contract damages their personnel could not have reasonably foreseen when you agreed to these terms.</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>As far as the law allows, the total liability to you for claims of any kind that are related to the forum or content on the forum will be limited to $50.</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\nFeedback\n<p>The company welcomes your feedback and suggestions for the forum.\nSee the Contact section below for ways to get in touch with us.</p>\n<p>You agree that the company will be free to act on feedback and suggestions you provide, and that the company won\u2019t have to notify you that your feedback was used, get your permission to use it, or pay you.\nYou agree not to submit feedback or suggestions that you believe might be confidential or proprietary, to you or others.</p>\nTermination\n<p>Either you or the company may end the agreement written out in these terms at any time.\nWhen our agreement ends, your permission to use the forum also ends.</p>\n<p>The following provisions survive the end of our agreement: Your Content, Feedback, Your Responsibility, Disclaimers, Limits on Liability, and General Terms.</p>\nDisputes\n<p>California law will govern any dispute related to these terms or your use of the forum.</p>\n<p>You and the company agree to seek injunctions related to these terms only in state or federal court in city_for_disputes.\nNeither you nor the company will object to jurisdiction, forum, or venue in those courts.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Other than to seek an injunction or for claims under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, you and the company will resolve any dispute by binding American Arbitration Association arbitration.\nArbitration will follow the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.\nArbitration will happen in city_for_disputes.\nYou will settle any dispute as an individual, and not as part of a class action or other representative proceeding, whether as the plaintiff or a class member.\nNo arbitrator will consolidate any dispute with any other arbitration without the company\u2019s permission.</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>Any arbitration award will include costs of the arbitration, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, and reasonable costs for witnesses.\nYou and the company may enter arbitration awards in any court with jurisdiction.</p>\nGeneral Terms\n<p>If a provision of these terms is unenforceable as written, but could be changed to make it enforceable, that provision should be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.\nOtherwise, that provision should be removed.</p>\n<p>You may not assign your agreement with the company.\nThe company may assign your agreement to any affiliate of the company, any other company that obtains control of the company, or any other company that buys assets of the company related to the forum.\nAny attempted assignment against these terms has no legal effect.</p>\n<p>Neither the exercise of any right under this Agreement, nor waiver of any breach of this Agreement, waives any other breach of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>These terms embody all the terms of agreement between you and the company about use of the forum.\nThese terms entirely replace any other agreements about your use of the forum, written or not.</p>\nContact\n<p>You may notify the company under these terms, and send questions to the company, at support@techlore.tech.</p>\n<p>The company may notify you under these terms using the e-mail address you provide for your account on the forum, or by posting a message to the homepage of the forum or your account page.</p>\nChanges\n<p>The company last updated these terms on March 31, 2022, and may update these terms again.\nThe company will post all updates to the forum.\nFor updates that contain substantial changes, the company agrees to e-mail you, if you\u2019ve created an account and provided a valid e-mail address.\nThe company may also announce updates with special messages or alerts on the forum.</p>\n<p>Once you get notice of an update to these terms, you must agree to the new terms in order to keep using the forum.</p> ", "created_at": "2022-12-10 03:07:02.887574", "updated_at": "2022-12-10 03:07:10.922312"}, {"id": 13123, "name": "Forum  Privacy Policy ", "url": "https://discuss.techlore.tech/privacy",
