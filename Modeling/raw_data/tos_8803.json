identify and implement additional or alternative solutions when necessary, to ensure that an essentially equivalent level of protection to that guaranteed within the EEA of the personal data transferred is maintained.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\n</strong>Additional Contractual Measures</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.1</strong> Transparency obligations</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u3000(a) </strong>Klaviyo declares that (1)&nbsp;it has not purposefully created back doors or similar programming that could be used to access the system and/or personal data, (2)&nbsp;it has not purposefully created or changed its business processes in a manner that facilitates access to personal data or systems, and (3)&nbsp;that national law or government policy does not require Klaviyo to create or maintain back doors or to

GDPR.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\n</strong>Additional obligations in case of requests or access by public authorities</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.1</strong> Klaviyo shall promptly inform Customer:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u3000(a)</strong> Of any legally binding requests from a law enforcement or other government authority (\u201c<strong>Public Authority</strong>\u201d) to disclose the personal data shared by Customer (\u201c<strong>Transferred Personal Data</strong>\u201d).\nsuch notification shall include information about the personal data requested, the requesting authority, the legal basis for the request and the response provided.\nSuch notification shall occur prior to the disclosure of any personal data in response to such requests.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u3000(b)</strong> If it becomes aware of any direct access by public authorities to transfer personal data in accordance with the laws of the country of destination, such notification shall include all information available to Klaviyo.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u3000(c) </strong>If Klaviyo is prohibited from notifying Customer and/or the data subject, Klaviyo agrees to use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with a view to communicate as much information and as soon as possible.\nKlaviyo agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them upon request of the data exporter.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.2 </strong>Klaviyo agrees to review, under the laws of the country of destination, the legality of the public authority\u2019s request, notably whether it remains within the powers granted to the requesting public authority and exhaust all available remedies to challenge the request if, after a careful assessment, Klaviyo concludes that there are grounds under the laws of the country of destination to do so.\nThis includes requests under section&nbsp;702 of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court or Executive Order 12333.\nWhen challenging a request, Klaviyo shall seek interim measures with a view to suspend the effects of the request until the court has decided on the merits.\nKlaviyo shall not disclose or provide access to the personal data requested until required to do so under the applicable procedural rules and, at such time, shall provide only the minimum amount of information required to comply with the request, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.3</strong> Klaviyo agrees to preserve the information required to comply with this Schedule&nbsp;4 for the duration of the Agreement and,

2021</p>\n<p>It is Klaviyo\u2019s policy to respond to notices alleging that any material uploaded by users of the Services infringes another person\u2019s copyright.\nIf you believe any material accessible on or from the Klaviyo website or the Services infringes your copyright, you may request removal of those materials (or access thereto) from this website or the Services by contacting the Klaviyo, Inc.\ncopyright agent (identified below) and providing the following information:</p>\n<p>\u3000(a) Identification of the copyrighted work that you believe to be infringed.\nPlease describe the work, and where possible include a copy or the location (URL) of an authorized version of the work.</p>\n<p>\u3000(b) Identification of the material that you believe to be infringing and its location.\nPlease describe the material and provide us with its URL or any other pertinent information that will allow us to locate the material.</p>\n<p>\u3000(c) Your name, address, telephone number and (if available) email address.</p>\n<p>\u3000(d) A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the materials is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</p>\n<p>\u3000(e) A statement that the information that you have supplied is accurate, and indicating that \u201cunder penalty of perjury,\u201d you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on the copyright owner\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p>\u3000(f) A signature or the electronic equivalent from the copyright holder or authorized representative.</p>\n<p>Our agent for copyright issues relating to the Klaviyo website or Services is:</p>\n<p>Klaviyo Legal<br>Klaviyo, Inc.<br>125 Summer Street<br>Boston, Massachusetts 02110<br>Phone: 857-400-7060<br>Email:&nbsp;dmca@klaviyo.com<br>For all email submissions please include the subject line:&nbsp;<strong>DMCA Takedown Request</strong>.</p>\n<p>Submitting a DMCA takedown request is the start of a pre-defined process.\nYour request will be reviewed for accuracy, validity, and completeness.\nIf your request has satisfied the requirements above, Klaviyo will take action on the request \u2013 which includes removing or disabling access to the allegedly infringing material and forwarding a full copy of your request (including your name and contact information) to the user(s) engaged in the allegedly infringing activity.\nKlaviyo will make a good faith effort to contact the affected user(s) with information concerning the removal or disabling of access.</p>\n<p>If you are the recipient of a takedown request, please take time to read through Klaviyo\u2019s communication to you, which will include information on the request we received.\nIf you believe that the allegedly infringing material reported in the takedown request was misidentified, is not infringing, or was removed or disabled in error, you may send Klaviyo a counter-notification or you may seek a retraction of the takedown request from the requester.</p>\n<p>The takedown request you received will include the contact information of the requester.\nYou may reach out to them directly and ask them to retract their request.\nThe requester can send retractions to dmca@klaviyo.com and should include in their message: (1) identification of the allegedly infringing material, and (2) a statement that the requester would like to retract their DMCA takedown request.\nA retraction is at the sole discretion of the requester.</p>\n<p>A counter-notification is a request for Klaviyo to reinstate the removed or disabled material.\nYou may file a counter-notification if you believe that the allegedly infringing material was misidentified, is not infringing, or you have a good faith belief that the material should not have been removed and/or disabled.\nIf you\u2019re not sure whether you should file a counter-notification, you should consult with an attorney.</p>\n<p>To submit a counter-notification, you will need to provide Klaviyo with the following information:</p>\n<p>\u3000(a) A physical or electronic signature.</p>\n<p>\u3000(b) Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.</p>\n<p>\u3000(c) A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.</p>\n<p>\u3000(d) Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if the subscriber\u2019s address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Klaviyo may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the original requester or an agent of such person.</p>\n<p>Once we receive a valid counter-notification, we will promptly forward a copy (including your name and contact information) to the person who submitted the original request.\nIf the original requester disagrees that the content was removed or disabled in error or misidentification, they may pursue legal action against you.\nIf we do not receive notice within 10 business days that the original requester is seeking a court order to prevent further infringement of the material at issue, we may replace or cease disabling access to the material that was removed.</p>\n<p>Klaviyo may, at its discretion, share a copy of your takedown request or counter-notification with third parties (including for publication).\nIf you are uncomfortable sharing your contact information, you may wish to consider appointing an agent to submit your request or counter-notification on your behalf.\nYour agent will be required to submit the request or counter-notification with valid contact information and identify you as the party that they are representing.</p>\n<p>Please think twice before submitting a takedown request or counter-notification, especially if you\u2019re not sure whether you are the actual copyright holder or authorized to act on behalf of the copyright holder.\nThere are legal and financial consequences for fraudulent and/or bad faith submissions.</p>\n<p>Klaviyo has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances, accounts of users of the Services who are deemed to have repeatedly uploaded content that infringes the intellectual property rights of others.</p>\nOwn your data.<br>Own your
