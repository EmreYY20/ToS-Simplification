Service <p>These Terms of Service are the legal agreement between you (\u201cYou\u201d) and GeoRiot Networks Inc.\n(\"GeoRiot,\" \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cwe\u201d) related to your use of our link optimization and management service (the \"Genius Link Services\").\nThe Genius Link Services include the information, software, products, and services contained in or available through our public website, geniuslink.com, our Dashboard, https://my.geni.us, our blog, geniuslink.com/blog/, our APIs, api.geni.us, and our knowledge base, intercom.geni.us (together, our \"Site\").\nThese Terms of Service govern your use of the Genius Link Services, including when You use our tools to build or edit links, enter information into our Site such as your affiliate or reporting tokens, post or maintain specialized links, create or review reports from our Site, or browse or click on links on web pages.</p>\n<p>Use of the Genius Link Services constitutes your agreement to all the terms, conditions, and notices contained in these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy.\nThese Terms of Service include the Data Processing Addendum below.\nPlease be sure to review the liability disclaimer and the binding arbitration provision.\nBoth of these may affect your rights.\nTo agree to these Terms of Service, check the \"I agree\" box when creating an account for the Genius Link Services.\nIf You do not agree to these terms, or if You are not at least 18 years old, do not check \"I agree,\" and do not use the Genius Link Services or the Site.\nGeoRiot reserves the right to amend these Terms of Service.\nSee \"Modification of these Terms of Service\" below.</p>\n<p>For a complete description of the features of the Genius Link Services, and to sign up, go to http://geniuslink.com.</p> Genius Link Services <p>The Genius Link Services are a link management service that You can use any time You place a link in Your Digital Property.\n\"Your Digital Property\" includes your website, mobile application or other online property, and it includes offline properties such as when You print a link or place QR codes.\nThe Genius Link Services provide a specialized link(s), called a \"Geni.us Link\" (even when using a domain other than \u201cgeni.us\u201d) to replace any link in Your Digital Property that You specify.\nOnce You use a Geni.us Link in place of your original link, the Geni.us Link may route users who click on it (\"Buyers\") to the intended, or most relevant, item (\u201cProduct\u201d) in a retail website (\u201cStorefront\u201d) that is most appropriate based on the Buyer's location, device, language or other factors.\n(Note: we refer to our links as \"Geni.us Link\" even though they may use a different domain.) </p>\n<p>The Genius Link Services process certain information (\u201cBuyer Information\u201d) when a Buyer clicks a Geni.us Link in the course of viewing and interacting with content on Your Digital Property (a \u201cTransaction\u201d).\n</p>\n<p>Buyer Information also includes any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Information identifying and describing (\u201cDevice Data\u201d) the personal computer, laptop, smartphone or other device providing Internet access through a browser used for the Transaction (\"Device\"), including the operating system and browser used by the Device for the Transaction (\"User Agent Information\").</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Information identifying the language used by the Device for the Transaction (\u201cLanguage Information\u201d).\nThe Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address of the Device used for the Transaction, which allows identification of the logical and to some extent geographical location of the Device used in the Transaction (\"Location Data\").</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The URL of Your Digital Property on which the originating Geni.us Link is sited (\"Client URL\").</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Product identification information for Products via the Geni.us Link the Device was used to click.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Geni.us Link may also incorporate the appropriate affiliate information for your link if You have provided GeoRiot with the applicable affiliate parameters.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, You may elect to collect and provide GeoRiot with the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Limited purchase information obtained by the Storefront in the event a Buyer purchases a Product in the course of a Transaction, such as the number of products purchased, a list of items (or categories of items), purchase prices, and timestamp of the Transaction.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Geni.us Link may support the following uses of information for your benefit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<i>Dynamic Links.</i>&nbsp;You can use a single link to route Buyers to the appropriate Storefront based on information such as the user\u2019s location, device, and language set in the browser.\nThis may include dynamic links on Your Digital Property which automatically populate a Storefront customized for the Buyer on Your Digital Property.\nFor example, a client\u2019s website that reviews technology devices may display related products with links to purchase them on Amazon\u2019s Storefront.\nThe Geni.us Link may be used to ensure the Amazon link that appears on the client\u2019s website is directed appropriately based on the Buyer\u2019s location.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<i>Automatic Product Localization.</i>&nbsp;You can use a single link to automatically route Buyers to the appropriate Product in the Buyer\u2019s local Storefront, such as the Amazon or Apple Music online stores.\nAutomatic affiliation may be used to earn commissions from the correct local retailer\u2019s Storefront.\nFor example, a Buyer in Germany may be sent to the Amazon Germany Storefront by a Geni.us Link from a client website, and the client might earn a commission through the Amazon Germany affiliate program.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<i>Choice Pages.</i>&nbsp;You may use a link to provide a mobile-optimized landing page where a Buyer can view different buying options, rather than having an automated process pick for them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<i>Retargeting.</i>&nbsp;You may use a Geni.us Link to fire javascript and set pixels on your behalf to enable collection of your activity data by third parties such as Facebook and Google.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<i>Data Analytics.</i>&nbsp;The Data Analytics service provides You with marketing content based on Location Data, Device Data, User Agent Information, Language Information and Transactions data.\nThe Data Analytics service helps You ensure that marketing efforts are relevant to the Buyer and appropriate to the country or region where the Buyer is located.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When You create a Genius Link account, You must provide GeoRiot with contact information for an individual user authorized to use the Genius Link Services and communicate with GeoRiot (\u201cYour User\u201d), either as an individual or on behalf of an organization, such as Your User\u2019s name and email address.\nWe may also collect the content of Your User\u2019s communications with us, transactional information, and usage data when Your User engages with the Genius Link Services (collectively, \u201cYour User\u2019s Information\u201d).</p> Fees and Payment <p>The Genius Link Services employ a monthly fee model with additional pay-per-click pricing for overages.\nYou will be charged on a monthly basis.\nIn your plan, You may be given an amount of free clicks that You can use within the calendar month timeframe.\nAfter that number of clicks, if any, is exhausted, additional \"buckets\" of clicks will be automatically added to your monthly invoice.\nYou will only be charged for the clicks on your Geni.us Links during the previous month that are deemed by GeoRiot to have originated organically (non-bot, or non-junk, clicks).\nOther additional features (such as a custom domains or users) are provided for an additional monthly fee.\nYou agree to pay the plan price, any additional per-click fees, and any other charges incurred in connection with your Genius Link subscription/account (\u201cYour Account\u201d) (including any applicable taxes) at the rates in effect for the plan selected.\nThe rates in effect are found on our website at http://geniuslink.com/pricing.\nYou may also find your rate, if different than the published rates, and current account balance on the Billing page in the Dashboard (https://my.geni.us/account/billing).\nWe will notify You by email at least 14 days in advance of any mandatory rate change affecting Your Account and You are permitted to change to any currently available plans at any time.\nWhen changing plans, your monthly fee will reflect the change as of the day the plan was changed, and your fees will be pro-rated.\nDowngrading plans may result in an irreversible loss of features of your existing Geni.us Links.\n</p>\n<p>Payments can be made via credit card or debit card through our Dashboard.\nUnless You make other arrangements with us, we will invoice You on the first day of each month and automatically charge your payment card shortly thereafter.\nIn the event that the payment card could not be charged initially, we will make subsequent attempts.\nIf You cannot provide a valid payment card, contact GeoRiot, and at GeoRiot's discretion, monthly invoicing via ACH, SWIFT, or other electronic means may be made available within 14 days of creating Your Account.\nIf no means of electronic transfer is available, GeoRiot, at its option, may create a custom agreement and payment model with You.\n</p>\n<p>A free trial may be provided for new clients and may consist of a period of time, as defined on the pricing page, billing page or in a separate agreement, in which the client may have an unlimited number of free clicks and access to features.\nWhere a free trial is offered, each plan gets a certain number of clicks included each month before being charged overages after the trial is over.\nThe number of free clicks, if any, before your payment card will be charged is published at http://geniuslink.com/pricing and is dependent on the plan You choose.\nThe number of free clicks depends on the free trial offered and the plan You select and is subject to change.\n</p>\n<p>You agree to pay any invoice issued by GeoRiot within 30 days of the date of invoice unless otherwise previously agreed in writing by GeoRiot.\nGeoRiot reserves all remedies if You fail to make timely payment, including termination of Your Account.\nIn any case, in the event of late or non-payment, the Genius Link Services may immediately limit functionality of your Geni.us Links.\nThis may include disabling your affiliate parameters (if any were supplied), using the Geni.us Link parameters for any subsequent clicks on Geni.us Links, disabling advanced targets, disabling support for your specified pixels during a Geni.us Link redirect, and significantly reducing functionality of your Dashboard.\nThis may also include converting your Geni.us Links into Choice Pages which may include additional retailers and/or relevant product ads and/or cookies or analogous technologies.\nFull Geni.us Link and Dashboard functionality will be restored when Your Account is made current.</p>\n<p> If Your Account is past due for more than 45 days, or closed, we may reassign your Geni.us Link.\nWe may also reassign your Geni.us Link (1) with your consent, (2) if your Geni.us Link has failed to yield at least 30 organic clicks (i.e., non-junk clicks) per month for three consecutive months, or (3) we have marked Your Account as a Terms of Service violator.</p>\n<p>Generally, all fees and charges are non-refundable.\nAt our discretion, we may issue refunds or credits.\nIf we do issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nWe may change the fees and charges currently in effect, or add new fees or charges, by giving You notice in advance and an opportunity to cancel.\nIf You want to use a different payment card or You need to update your payment card details, You may do so within the Dashboard by adding a new card first, which will delete your previous card.\nIf You believe someone has accessed the Genius Link Services using your username and password without your authorization, please immediately notify us at hi@geni.us with the subject \"Suspected unauthorized access\".\nYou are responsible for any fees or charges incurred to access the Genius Link Services through an Internet access provider or other third party service.</p>\n<p>Any accrued account credits will be applied first to an invoice.\nIf the account credit doesn't fully cover the amount then You are responsible for covering the difference via the payment method on file.\nIf your account credit fully covers the current invoice, the remaining balance will be applied to the next invoice.\n</p>\n<p>Excess account credit may be paid out via a check after accruing at least $1,000 USD or at the discretion of GeoRiot.\nAccrued account credits are forfeited if Your Account is terminated.</p> Term.\nTermination and Renewal <p>Subject to amendment as provided below, these Terms of Service will remain in full force and effect while You use the Genius Link Services.\nYou may terminate Your Account at any time.\nYour subscription will renew automatically until it is terminated.\nYou may terminate your subscription using the Dashboard at https://my.geni.us/account/#close-account-section or by contacting Customer Service at hi@geni.us.\nWe may terminate Your Account at any time upon notice to You, however, if we deem Your Account to be violating our Terms of Service we may terminate your subscription/account without notice to You.</p>\n<p>If You disagree with the amount of any invoice, You agree to inform us of the grounds for the dispute within seven days after You received the invoice.\n</p>\n<p>Most client concerns can be resolved quickly and to the client's satisfaction by emailing the Genius Link team at hi@geni.us or calling us, and leaving a message, at 408.384.8165 during normal business hours in the UTC-8 (West Coast) time zone.</p> Effect of Termination <p>Upon termination of Your Account for any reason, GeoRiot may immediately stop serving your affiliate tracking code.\nIf we stop serving your affiliate tracking code, we may or may not continue to redirect clicks with the Genius Link Services' default affiliate parameter(s) at our discretion.\nAdditionally, we may also convert your Geni.us Links into Choice Pages, which may include additional retailers and/or relevant product ads and/or cookies or analogous technology.\nIn such cases, we may receive any affiliate program and/or ad revenue associated with your links until You delete or modify the Geni.us Links on Your Digital Property.\nNo charges will be made to your payment card for any clicks served after termination, but any Geni.us Link may, or may not, at our discretion, only resolve to the original destination, and additional features such as advanced targets or remarketing pixels may be disabled.\nUpon termination of Your Account, your right to use the Genius Link Services and our right to charge You will terminate, but obligations that arose before termination that by their nature should continue, will continue (e.g., confidentiality covenant, indemnification obligations, payment obligations, disclaimers, liability limitations) and You will be responsible for paying any charges that accrued before termination.\n</p> Failure to Provide Affiliate Parameters <p>When You sign up for the Genius Link Services You are prompted, but not required, to provide your parameters for the relevant affiliate programs (e.g., an affiliate token or an example link from the program) via the specialized \"Affiliate\" tool in the Dashboard (found at https://my.geni.us/Affiliate).\nUntil You have provided us with the means to associate your Geni.us Links with an affiliate program, You will not receive any commissions, payments, credit, or other benefits from these affiliate programs.\nThe same goes for countries or affiliate programs that You do not support.\nIn such cases GeoRiot may receive any affiliate program revenue associated with your Geni.us Links.\nPlease take note that affiliate parameters already embedded in your links that are converted to Geni.us Links may not automatically transfer during the Geni.us Link redirection, regardless of the affiliate program or link.\nYou must supply your affiliate parameters via the \"Affiliate\" tool in the Dashboard to ensure You receive credit for them.\nContact the Genius Link team if You have questions about the affiliation of a link not specifically supported by the Genius Link Services.\n</p> Up Time <p>We strive to meet industry uptime standards, and as of the published date, has had over 99.99% uptime, but we cannot guarantee that the Genius Link Services, the Site, or the Dashboard will be accessible and available at all times.\nFor example, sometimes the Dashboard may be inaccessible due to service maintenance, user error, or failures of our upstream providers beyond our control.\nIf having a specific uptime guarantee is important to your business, please contact us to enter into a separate agreement.</p>\n<p>Our goal is 100% uptime.\nhowever, from time to time, we may need to suspend service for system upgrades and maintenance.\nExcept in unusual cases, we will give 24 hours public advance notice of any planned system downtime.\nAs the Genius Link Services run independently from the Dashboard, we will not generally give notice of Dashboard downtime.</p>\n<p>We will not be liable for lost clicks due to Site access or the Genius Link Services being interrupted.\nWe will work to restore services as quickly as we can, but we make no guarantees as to how quickly we will be able to restore service since it depends on many factors.\nFurther, we may require action from You to restore service and You are requested to comply as quickly as possible.\nWe may, but are not required, to compensate You for any downtime in Site access or the Genius Link Services in our sole discretion by giving You performance credits.</p>\n<p>Similarly GeoRiot is not liable and cannot be held accountable for issues or errors in regards to the affiliate networks' or advertisers' handling of clicks or Geni.us Links.</p> Service Data <p>We collect, use, and maintain data in connection with the Genius Link Services in accordance with our Privacy Policy, the terms of which are incorporated into these Terms of Service and are part of your agreement with us.\nYou acknowledge and agree that we will collect data from your Geni.us Links and clicks with that of other customers for use in our analytical services.\nSome analytical services are a premium service that You may select in your service options.\nAggregated click data are our work product and property.\nIn our sole discretion, we may choose to make metrics available to our clients in accordance with applicable law, rules and regulations.\n</p> Data Protection Law <p>The types of information we collect regarding Buyers and Your User(s), and the purposes for that collection, are explained both in our Privacy Policy and

alien or zombie invasions, and other unforeseeable events that are not the direct or indirect fault of either party (collectively, \"Force Majeure Events\").\nIn any such case, the affected party will use commercially reasonable efforts to work around the Force Majeure Event and mitigate any impacts of any delay or failure in performance or interruption of service.\nThe delay or failure in performance or interruption of service must be without the fault or negligence of the party claiming excusable delay, and the party claiming excusable delay must promptly notify the other party of the

each party agrees to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of courts of general jurisdiction.</p> Arbitration Procedures <p>You and we (each, a \u201cparty;\u201d together, the \u201cparties\u201d) agree that all disputes and claims between us will be settled by arbitration or in small claims court.\nThis agreement to arbitrate (the \"Arbitration Agreement\") is intended to be broadly interpreted.\nIt includes, but is not limited to the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which You are not a member of a certified class.\nand</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Claims that may arise after the termination of the Terms of Service.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although You may not bring a suit in a court other than small claims court, You may bring issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Communications Commission or the Attorney General of your state.\nIf the law allows, such agencies can seek relief against us on your behalf.</p>\n<p>By entering into this Arbitration Agreement, You and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</p>\n<p>Because this document includes this Arbitration Agreement, making it a transaction in interstate commerce, it is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>\n<p>This Arbitration Agreement will survive termination of Your Account.</p>\n<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written notice of dispute (\"Notice\").\nThe Notice to us should be addressed to General Counsel C/O GeoRiot Networks, Inc.\n2320 S.\nSpokane St, Seattle, WA USA (the \"Notice Address\").\nThe Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nIf You and we are not able to reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 60 calendar days after the Notice is received, either party may commence an arbitration proceeding by filing an arbitration Demand.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by either made by either party will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount You or we should receive.</p>\n<p>The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), known collectively as \"the AAA Rules.\" These rules may be as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nand they will be administered by the AAA.\nThe AAA Rules are available at three sources: (1) online at adr.org.\n(2) by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nor (3) by writing to the Notice Address.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator will decide all issues, including the scope and enforceability of the Terms of Service, and arbitrability under the Arbitration Agreement.</p>\n<p>Unless we and You agree otherwise, arbitration hearings will make use of telephonic conferencing to the extent practical.\nOtherwise, hearings will take place in a location reasonably convenient for both parties, and with due consideration for the parties ability to travel and other similarly pertinent circumstances.\nIf the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by AAA.</p>\n<p>If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that You may choose from the following three ways of conducting the arbitration: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(b) through a telephonic hearing.\nor (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.\nIf your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</p>\n<p>The payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.</p>\n<p>This arbitrator may make rulings or resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees and expenses.\nThis may be done at any time during the proceeding.\nit also may be done upon request by either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.</p>\n<p>Either party may apply to the arbitrator seeking injunctive relief until the arbitration award is rendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved.\nEither party also, without waiving any remedy under this Arbitration Agreement, may seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim or provisional relief that is necessary to protect the rights or property of that party, pending the establishment of the arbitration tribunal.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of a single party and only to provide that party's relief.\nYou and we agree that each may bring claims against the other only as individuals.\nneither can become a plaintiff or class member in a class or representative proceeding.\nUnless both You and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate the claims of multiple persons.\nThe arbitrator is not allowed to preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nAny attempt to issue a class or representative award will exceed the arbitrator's power.</p>\n<p>Changes to the Arbitration Provision.\nWe may, in the future, make changes to this Arbitration Agreement by providing You notice under the \"Modification of these Terms of Service\" provision above.\nWe agree that should such a change be made while You are our customer, You may reject it by sending us written notice.\nThe notice must be given within 30 calendar days of the notice of modification to the Notice Address provided above.\nBy rejecting any future change, You are agreeing, in accordance with the language of this provision, that You will settle any dispute between us by arbitration.\nThis remains in effect even if it seems to conflict with some other provision in these Terms of Service.\nNote: This paragraph does not apply if the change concerns only the Notice Address.</p> General <p>You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between You and us as a result of the Terms of Service or use of the Genius Link Services.\nOur performance under these Terms of Service is subject to existing laws and legal process.\nNothing contained in these Terms of Service diminishes GeoRiot's right to comply with governmental, court, and law enforcement requests or requirements relating either to your use of our service or to information supplied to us.\nIf any part of these Terms of Service is determined to be invalid or unenforceable as a result of the above warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, or as a result of any other legal requirements, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be considered to have been replaced by whatever valid, enforceable provision most closely matches what the original provision was intending to accomplish.\nThe remainder of these Terms of Service will continue in effect.\nWe waive no right under the Terms of Service even if we fail to enforce or exercise it.</p>\n<p>These Terms of Service, including the Data Processing Addendum, the Privacy Policy, and the service options on our Site constitute the entire agreement between You and GeoRiot with respect to the Genius Link Services.\nIt supersedes all prior or contemporary communications and proposals between us, whether electronic, oral, or written.\nYou may not pass on to someone else any of your rights or obligations under these Terms of Service or the Privacy Policy without our written consent.\nWe may transfer our rights under the Terms of Service to someone else without your consent.\n</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise stated, we may communicate with You officially by any reasonable means now known or later developed.\nThese currently include email, regular mail, and postings on our Dashboard.</p>\n<p>A version of these Terms of Service or of any notice sent in electronic form will be equally as admissible in legal proceedings relating to these Terms of Service as documents generated and maintained in paper form.\nAll parties approve of these Terms of

free-standing document that does not incorporate commercial business terms established by the parties under separate commercial arrangements.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The details of the transfer (as well as the personal data covered) are specified in Annex B, which forms an integral part of the clauses.</p> I.\nObligations of the data exporter <p>The data exporter warrants and undertakes that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The personal data have been collected, processed and transferred in accordance with the laws applicable to the data exporter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It has used reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able to satisfy its legal obligations under these clauses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It will provide the data importer, when so requested, with copies of relevant data protection laws or references to them (where relevant, and not including legal advice) of the country in which the data exporter is established.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It will respond to enquiries from data subjects and the authority concerning processing of the personal data by the data importer, unless the parties have agreed that the data importer will so respond, in which case the

their right to draw the removal to the attention of the authority.\nHowever, the data exporter shall abide by a decision of the authority regarding access to the full text of the clauses by data subjects, as long as data subjects have agreed to respect the confidentiality of the confidential information removed.\nThe data exporter shall also provide a copy of the clauses to the authority where required.</p>\n</li>\n</ol> II.\nObligations of the data importer <p>The data importer warrants and undertakes that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>It will have in place appropriate technical and

access to the personal data, including processors, will respect and maintain the confidentiality and security of the personal data.\nAny person acting under the authority of the data importer, including a data processor, shall be obligated to process the personal data only on instructions from the data importer.\nThis provision does not apply to persons authorised or required by law or regulation to have access to the personal data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It has no reason to believe, at the time of entering into these clauses, in the existence of any local laws that would have a substantial adverse effect on the guarantees provided for under these clauses, and it will inform the data exporter (which will pass such notification on to the authority where required) if it becomes aware of any such laws.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It will process the personal data for purposes described in Annex B, and has the legal authority to give the warranties and fulfil the undertakings set out

will cooperate in good faith with the data exporter, the data subject and the authority concerning all such enquiries within a reasonable time.\nIn case of legal dissolution of the data exporter, or if the parties have so agreed, the data importer will assume responsibility for compliance with the provisions of clause I(e).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At the request of the data exporter, it will provide the data exporter with evidence of financial resources sufficient to fulfil its responsibilities under clause III (which may include insurance coverage).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upon reasonable request of the data exporter, it will submit its data processing facilities, data files and documentation needed for processing to reviewing, auditing and/or certifying by the data exporter (or any independent or impartial inspection agents or auditors, selected by the data exporter and not reasonably objected to by the data importer) to ascertain compliance with the warranties and undertakings in these clauses, with reasonable notice and during regular business hours.\nThe request will be subject to any necessary consent or approval from a regulatory or supervisory authority within the country of the data importer, which consent or approval the data importer will attempt to obtain in a timely fashion.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It will process the personal data, at its option, in accordance with:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>the data protection laws of the country in which the data exporter is established, or</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the relevant provisions<sup>1</sup> of any Commission decision pursuant to Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC, where the data importer complies with the relevant provisions of such an authorisation or decision and is based in a country to which such an authorisation or decision pertains, but is not covered by such authorisation or decision for the purposes of the transfer(s) of the personal data<sup>2</sup>, or</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the data processing principles set forth in Annex A.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p> Data importer to indicate which option it selects: (iii)</p>\n<p> Initials of data importer: GeoRiot;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>It will not disclose or transfer the personal data to a third party data controller located outside the European Economic Area (EEA) unless it notifies the data exporter about the transfer and</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>the third party data controller processes the personal data in accordance with a Commission decision finding that a third country provides adequate protection, or</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the third party data controller becomes a signatory to these clauses or another data transfer agreement approved by a competent authority in the EU, or</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>data subjects have been given the opportunity to object, after having been informed of the purposes of the transfer, the categories of recipients and the fact that the countries to which data is exported may have different data protection standards, or</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>with regard to onward transfers of sensitive data, data subjects have given their unambiguous consent to the onward transfer.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol> III.\nLiability and third party rights <ol>\n<li>\n<p>Each party shall be liable to the other parties for damages it causes by any breach of these clauses.\nLiability as between the parties is limited to actual damage suffered.\nPunitive damages (i.e.\ndamages intended to punish a party for its outrageous conduct) are specifically excluded.\nEach party shall be liable to data subjects for damages it causes by any breach of third party rights under these clauses.\nThis does not affect the liability of the data exporter under its data protection law.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The parties agree that a data subject shall have the right to enforce as a third party beneficiary this clause and clauses I(b), I(d), I(e), II(a), II(c), II(d), II(e), II(h), II(i), III(a), V, VI(d) and VII against the data importer or the data exporter, for their respective breach of their contractual obligations, with regard to his personal data, and accept jurisdiction for this purpose in the data exporter\u2019s country of establishment.\nIn cases involving allegations of breach by the data importer, the data subject must first request the data exporter to take appropriate action to enforce his rights against the data importer.\nif the data exporter does not take such action within a reasonable period (which under normal circumstances would be one month), the data subject may then enforce his rights against the data importer directly.\nA data subject is entitled to proceed directly against a data exporter that has failed to use reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able to satisfy its legal obligations under these clauses (the data exporter shall have the burden to prove that it took reasonable efforts).</p>\n</li>\n</ol> IV.\nLaw applicable to the clauses <p>These clauses shall be governed by the law of the country in which the data exporter is established, with the exception of the laws and regulations relating to processing of the personal data by the data importer under clause II(h), which shall apply only if so selected by the data importer under that clause.</p> V.\nResolution of disputes with data subjects or the authority <ol>\n<li>\n<p>In the event of a dispute or claim brought by a data subject or the authority concerning the processing of the personal data against either or both of the parties, the parties will inform each other about any such disputes or claims, and will cooperate with a view to settling them amicably in a timely fashion.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The parties agree to respond to any generally available non-binding mediation procedure initiated by a data subject or by the authority.\nIf they do participate in the proceedings, the parties may elect to do so remotely (such as by telephone or other electronic means).\nThe parties also agree to consider participating in any other arbitration, mediation or other dispute resolution proceedings developed for data protection disputes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Each party shall abide by a decision of a competent court of the data exporter\u2019s country of establishment or of the authority which is final and against which no further appeal is possible.</p>\n</li>\n</ol> VI.\nTermination <ol>\n<li>\n<p>In the event that the data importer is in breach of its obligations under these clauses, then the data exporter may temporarily suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until the breach is repaired or the contract is terminated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the event that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>the transfer of personal data to the data importer has been temporarily suspended by the data exporter for longer than one month pursuant to paragraph (a);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>compliance by the data importer with these clauses would put it in breach of its legal or regulatory obligations in the country of import;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of any warranties or undertakings given by it under these clauses;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a final decision against which no further appeal is possible of a competent court of the data exporter\u2019s country of establishment or of the authority rules that there has been a breach of the clauses by the data importer or the data exporter.\nor</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a petition is presented for the administration or winding up of the data importer, whether in its personal or business capacity, which petition is not dismissed within the applicable period for such dismissal under applicable law.\na winding up order is made.\na receiver is appointed over any of its assets.\na trustee in bankruptcy is appointed, if the data importer is an individual.\na company voluntary arrangement is commenced by it.\nor any equivalent event in any jurisdiction occurs</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p> then the data exporter, without prejudice to any other rights which it may have against the data importer, shall be entitled to terminate these clauses, in which case the authority shall be informed where required.\nIn cases covered by (i), (ii), or (iv) above the data importer may also terminate these clauses.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Either party may terminate these clauses if (i) any Commission positive adequacy decision under Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC (or any superseding text) is issued in relation to the country (or a sector thereof) to which the data is transferred and processed by the data importer, or (ii) Directive 95/46/EC (or any superseding text) becomes directly applicable in such country.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The parties agree that the termination of these clauses at any time, in any circumstances and for whatever reason (except for termination under clause VI(c)) does not exempt them from the obligations and/or conditions under the clauses as regards the processing of the personal data transferred.</p>\n</li>\n</ol> VII.\nVariation of these clauses <p>The parties may not modify these clauses except to update any information in Annex B, in which case they will inform the authority where required.\nThis does not preclude the parties from adding additional commercial clauses where required.</p> VIII.\nDescription of the Transfer <p>The details of the transfer and of the personal data are specified in Annex B.\nThe parties agree that Annex B may contain confidential business information which they will not disclose to third parties, except as required by law or in response to a competent regulatory or government agency, or as required under clause I(e).\nThe parties may execute additional annexes to cover additional transfers, which will be submitted to the authority where required.\nAnnex B may, in the alternative, be drafted to cover multiple transfers.</p> IX.\nDispute resolution between data exporter and data importer <p>In the event of a dispute between the data importer and the data exporter concerning any alleged breach of any provision of these clauses, such dispute shall be finally settled in accordance with the procedures, terms and conditions set forth in the dispute resolution sections of GeoRiot\u2019s Terms of Service titled \u201cGoverning Law,\u201d \u201cBinding Arbitration.\nWaiver of Class Action\u201d and \u201cArbitration Procedures,\u201d incorporated here by reference.</p> X.\nAllocation of costs <p>Each party shall perform its obligations under these clauses at its own cost.</p>\n<p>Dated: Effective Date </p>\n<p>GeoRiot Networks, Inc.</p>\n<p>FOR DATA IMPORTER</p>\n<p>You</p>\n<p>FOR DATA EXPORTER</p> ANNEX A DATA PROCESSING PRINCIPLES <ol>\n<ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Purpose limitation: Personal data may be processed and subsequently used or further communicated only for purposes described in Annex B or subsequently authorised by the data subject.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Data quality and proportionality: Personal data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.\nThe personal data must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are transferred and further processed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Transparency: Data subjects must be provided with information necessary to ensure fair processing (such as information about the purposes of processing and about the transfer), unless such information has already been given by the data exporter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Security and confidentiality: Technical and organisational security measures must be taken by the data controller that are appropriate to the risks, such as against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, presented by the processing.\nAny person acting under the authority of the data controller, including a processor, must not process the data except on instructions from the data controller.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rights of access, rectification, deletion and objection: As provided in Article 12 of Directive 95/46/EC, data subjects must, whether directly or via a third party, be provided with the personal information about them that an organisation holds, except for requests which are manifestly abusive, based on unreasonable intervals or their number or repetitive or systematic nature, or for which access need not be granted under the law of the country of the data exporter.\nProvided that the authority has given its prior approval, access need also not be granted when doing so would be likely to seriously harm the interests of the data importer or other organisations dealing with the data importer and such interests are not overridden by the interests for fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.\nThe sources of the personal data need not be identified when this is not possible by reasonable efforts, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.\nData subjects must be able to have the personal information about them rectified, amended, or deleted where it is inaccurate or processed against these principles.\nIf there are compelling grounds to doubt the legitimacy of the request, the organisation may require further justifications before proceeding to rectification, amendment or deletion.\nNotification of any rectification, amendment or deletion to third parties to whom the data have been disclosed need not be made when this involves a disproportionate effort.\nA data subject must also be able to object to the processing of the personal data relating to him if there are compelling legitimate grounds relating to his particular situation.\nThe burden of proof for any refusal rests on the data importer, and the data subject may always challenge a refusal before the authority.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sensitive data: The data importer shall take such additional measures (e.g.\nrelating to security) as are necessary to protect such sensitive data in accordance with its obligations under clause II.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Data used for marketing purposes: Where data are processed for the purposes of direct marketing, effective procedures should exist allowing the data subject at any time to \u201copt-out\u201d from having his data used for such purposes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Automated decisions: For purposes hereof \u201cautomated decision\u201d shall mean a decision by the data exporter or the data importer which produces legal effects concerning a data subject or significantly affects a data subject and which is based solely on automated processing of personal data intended to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to him, such as his performance at work, creditworthiness, reliability, conduct, etc.\nThe data importer shall not make any automated decisions concerning data subjects, except when:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>(i) such decisions are made by the data importer in entering into or performing a contract with the data subject, and</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<p> (ii) the data subject is given an opportunity to discuss the results of a relevant automated decision with a representative of the parties making such decision or otherwise to make representations to that parties.</p>\n<p>or</p>\n<ol>\n<ol>\n<ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>where otherwise provided by the law of the data exporter.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n</ol> ANNEX B DESCRIPTION OF THE TRANSFER Data

allows identification of the logical and to some extent geographical location of the Device used in the Transaction (\u201cLocation Data\u201d).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The URL of the Client\u2019s Digital Property on which the originating Geni.us Link is sited (\u201cClient URL\u201d).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Product identification information for Products via the Geni.us Link the Device was used to click (\u201cProduct Information\u201d).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, GeoRiot may collect the following information from third party sources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Limited purchase information obtained by the Retailer in the event a Buyer purchases a Product in the course of a Transaction, such as the number of products purchased, a list of items (or categories of items), purchase prices, and timestamp of the Transaction (\u201cLimited Purchase Information\u201d).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Geni.us Links may support the following uses of Personal Information, for the benefit of Clients:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<i>Dynamic Links.</i>&nbsp;A Client can use a single link to route Buyers to the appropriate Retailer website based on information such as the user\u2019s location, device, and language set in the browser.\nThis may include dynamic links on a Client\u2019s Digital Property which automatically populate a Storefront customized for the Buyer on the Digital Property.\nFor example, a Client website that reviews technology devices may display related products with links to purchase them on Retailer Amazon\u2019s Storefront.\nThe Geni.us Link may be used to ensure the Amazon link that appears on the Client\u2019s website is directed appropriately based on the Buyer\u2019s location.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<i>Automatic Product Localization.</i>&nbsp;A Client can use a single link to automatically route Buyers to the appropriate Product in the Buyer\u2019s local Storefront, such as the Amazon, iTunes, or Microsoft online stores.\nAutomatic affiliation may be used to earn commissions from the correct local Retailer\u2019s Storefront.\nFor example, a Buyer in Germany may be sent to the Amazon Germany Storefront by a Geni.us Link from a Client website, and the Client might earn a commission through the Amazon Germany affiliate program.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<i>Choice Pages.</i>&nbsp;A Client may use a link to provide a mobile-optimized landing page where a Buyer can view different buying options, rather than having an automated process pick for them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<i>Retargeting.</i>&nbsp;The Client may use a Geni.us Link to set pixels on behalf of the Client to enable collection of Client activity data by third-parties such as Facebook and Google.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<i>Data Analytics.</i>&nbsp;The Data Analytics service provides Clients with marketing content based on data identifying the geographical location (\u201cLocation Data\u201d), Device data, User Agent Data, Language Data and Transactions Data.\nThe Data Analytics service helps Clients ensure that marketing efforts are relevant to the Buyer and appropriate to the country or region where the Buyer is located.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>Site Visitors</b>\n</p>\n<p>When a Site Visitor navigates to and engages with the GeoRiot website, GeoRiot collects the following information automatically through

name, email addresses, and other contact information used to communicate with the Client User, the Client User\u2019s IP address, as well as the content of communications between GeoRiot and the Client User and any transactions the Client User engages in with GeoRiot.</p>\n<p>GeoRiot may use such information to communicate with the Client User and with other individuals acting on behalf of the Client with respect to the Genius Link Services, and to otherwise ensure proper administration of the Genius Link Services (\u201cAdministrative Purposes\u201d), and may use it to identify and communicate with respect to potential opportunities for the Client to obtain or use Genius Link Services from GeoRiot, or otherwise promote GeoRiot to the Client and Client User (\u201cMarketing

jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.</p>\n<p>To the extent the SCCs and the GDPR apply to Personal Information, for purposes of the Genius Link Services GeoRiot and the applicable Client are Joint Data Controllers of the Personal Information as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>GeoRiot offers Geni.us Links and the Genius Link Services to Clients, with pre-established coding and design which determine the information which is collected and the means by which information is processed.\nThe Client determines whether to implement Geni.us Link and use the Genius Link Services, and by agreement with GeoRiot determines to utilize the information collection scope and processing means offered by GeoRiot.\nAll Genius Link Services are provided for the benefit of the Client.\nThe Client is therefore the Data Controller with respect to the determination of the scope of the information to be collected and the means of its processing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Client determines where to site Geni.us Link(s) in the Client\u2019s Digital Properties, and the purpose(s) for which the information collected will be used (e.g., available Storefronts, implementation of routing alternatives, support for commissions, etc.).\nAll Personal Information about Buyers is processed for the benefit of the Client.\nThe Client is therefore the Data Controller with respect to the determination of siting of the Geni.us Link(s) and the purposes for which information is collected and processed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>GeoRiot determines the retention period for information collected via Geni.us Links.\nGeoRiot is therefore the Data Controller with respect to the retention of the Personal Information.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For purposes of Personal Information collected about Site Visitors and Client Users, GeoRiot is Data Controller.</p> 5.\nProvision of Notice to Buyers, Site Visitors, and Client Users <p>This Policy is published to provide notice of GeoRiot\u2019s data collection and privacy practices to individuals, including Buyers, Site Visitors, and Client Users.\nGeoRiot interacts directly with Client Users in the course of account registration and communications and transactions with respect to the Genius Link Services.\nHowever, GeoRiot does not typically interact directly with individuals, since its presence on its Clients\u2019 Digital Properties is limited to the Geni.us Link(s) in/on the Client\u2019s Digital Properties.\nGeoRiot therefore contractually requires its Clients to ensure their compliance with any legal requirements for notification to and consent by individuals with respect to their data collection and use practices, as required in their applicable jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>In addition, GeoRiot contractually requires its Clients to comply with the Network Advertising Initiative Code of Conduct where it is applicable to their business.\nIn particular, if a Client attempts to combine data about an individual from other sources with GeoRiot Personal Information, it is required to notify the affected individuals and obtain their opt-in consent in accordance with the NAI Code of Conduct.\nIf a Client collects data for interest-based advertising, it is required to clearly and conspicuously post a notice consistent with the NAI Code that contains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A statement that data may be collected for interest-based advertising;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A description of types of data that are collected for interest-based advertising purposes;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An explanation of how, and for what purpose, the data collected will be used or transferred to third parties.\nand</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A conspicuous link to an opt-out mechanism.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> 6.\nCollection of Information <p>\n<b>Buyers</b>\n</p>\n<p>GeoRiot principally collects information through transactions that occur as part of \u201cLink Localization.\u201d In this process a Geni.us Link which promotes or sells a product is posted on a Client\u2019s Digital Property, and automatically points to a Retailer\u2019s online Storefront designated by the Client.\nWhen a Buyer clicks the Geni.us Link, Personal Information is collected and transmitted to GeoRiot\u2019s servers.\nThis information is automatically analyzed to identify the location and type of Device being used to access the link.\nBased on this information, the Geni.us Link automatically redirects the Device to a web page in regional or country-specific storefront of the Retailer (\u201cLocalized Page\u201d) which promotes or sells the product.</p>\n<p>GeoRiot does not create or administer either its Clients\u2019 Digital Properties or Retailers\u2019 Storefront pages, does not provide content for either, and does not sell or promote products on either.\nThe only information GeoRiot collects from either the Digital Property or the Storefront is that provided in response to the click on the Genius Link.</p>\n<p>GeoRiot may collect and process the following information from the Device used to click on the Geni.us Link:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p> User Agent Information which identifies the Device, operating system and browser used by the Device in use.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Location Information, which is the IP address of the Device used in the Transaction.\nThe IP address provides network information, which can often be used to determine the country, state and sometimes city and postal code where the Device is in use.\nLocation Information is treated as if it were Personal Information.\nHowever, GeoRiot typically deletes Location Information within five minutes of the click, and does not maintain or store such data beyond that time period.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Language Information, which is the language associated with the Device\u2019s browser.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Client URL, which is the URL of the Client\u2019s Digital Property on which the originating Geni.us Link is sited.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Product Information, which is identification information for Products the Device was used to view.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Limited Purchase Information such as the number of products purchased, a list of items (or categories of items), purchase prices, and timestamp of the Transaction (\u201cLimited Purchase Information\u201d).\nLimited Purchase Information is collected and provided to GeoRiot by Clients, who are responsible for ensuring that any individual consent or authorization required for its use by GeoRiot has been obtained.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>GeoRiot does not collect any other information that might be considered, or might be used to derive, Personal Information, sensitive or otherwise.</p>\n<p>GeoRiot\u2019s Genius Link Services are only offered with respect to individuals who are 18 years of age or older.\nGeoRiot does not knowingly collect or maintain any Personal Information from individuals who are under 13 years of age, and no aspect of the Genius Link Services is designed to attract people under the age of 13.\nIf GeoRiot obtains knowledge that a Buyer is under the age of 13, GeoRiot will remove Personal Information with respect to that individual from its databases.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Site Visitors</b>\n</p>\n<p>When a Site Visitor navigates to and engages with the GeoRiot website, GeoRiot collects the following information automatically through external service providers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Interaction and usage data, including information about how you reached the website and your navigation of the website.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Information provided in connection with a comment posted on our blog, including your public Disqus account information or email address, Location Data, and the content of the post.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>Client Users</b>\n</p>\n<p>When a Client creates a GeoRiot account it must provide GeoRiot with contact information for individual users authorized to use the Genius Link Services and communicate with GeoRiot as or on behalf of a Client (\u201cClient Users\u201d).\nThis information may include Client User name, email addresses, and potentially other information used to communicate with the Client User, as well as the content of communications between GeoRiot and the Client User and any transactions the Client User engages in with GeoRiot.</p>\n<p>When a Client User engages with the GeoRiot website or the Genius Link platform, GeoRiot collects usage data automatically through external service providers.</p> 7.\nUse and Retention of Personal Information <p>GeoRiot may use and retain Personal Information about Buyers and Client Users in the following manner:</p>\n<p>\n<b>Buyers</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Client Users </b>\n</p>\n<p>For purposes of Link Localization, to redirect Consumers from digital properties to appropriate Storefronts.</p>\n<p>For purposes of Data Analytics, to create reports of Client marketing activities using Genius Link links.\nReports include aggregated information about matters including click trends, geographic information, sales and commissions data, separately or in combination, based on Data collected by GeoRiot.\nReports may be filtered based on specified parameters (e.g.\nnumber of clicks per day per specific location.\nclicks from specific referrers or from Devices using specific Software.\netc.).</p>\n<p>For purposes of Data Analytics, in aggregated data sets to support specific marketing strategies and Product and advertising content offerings, based on mashups of various types of data with different Transactions.</p>\n<p>For purposes of GeoRiot\u2019s internal management and administration, and fulfillment of our legal responsibilities or protection of our legal interests.</p>\n<p>To communicate with the Client User and with other individuals acting on behalf of the Client with respect to the Genius Link Services.</p>\n<p>To identify and communicate potential opportunities for the Client to obtain or use Genius Link Services from GeoRiot, or otherwise promote GeoRiot to the Client and Client User.\n</p>\n<p>For marketing or promotional purposes.</p>\n<p>For purposes of GeoRiot\u2019s internal management and administration, and fulfillment of our legal responsibilities or protection of our legal interests.</p>\n<p>GeoRiot may use and retain Personal Information about Site Visitors for purposes of internal data analytics and first-party marketing and advertising, and to otherwise identify and communicate potential opportunities to promote GeoRiot to Site Visitors, internal management and administration, and fulfillment of our legal responsibilities or protection of our legal interests.</p>\n<p>Subject to Section 6(c), GeoRiot may retain Buyer, Site Visitor, and Client User Personal Information in the following manner:</p>\n<p>In accordance with our retention policies.</p>\n<p>For any period we determine is necessary to ensure compliance with our legal responsibilities or to protect our legal interests.</p>\n<p>IP addresses for Buyers are only processed during the initial click on a Geni.us Link and are not stored thereafter.</p> 8.\nYour Choices with Respect to Personal Information <p>\n<b>Buyers</b>\n</p>\n<p>The Personal Information GeoRiot maintains about Buyers after processing a Geni.us Link click is limited to User Agent Information, Language Information, Client URL, Product Information, and Limited Purchase Information.\nAs noted above, GeoRiot typically deletes Location Information within 5 minutes of the click, and does not maintain or store such data beyond that time period.\nBecause GeoRiot lacks the ability to identify a particular Buyer in connection with any Personal Information that we store or maintain, we cannot offer Buyers any choices with respect to Personal Information.</p>\n<p>GeoRiot retains Device information that is subject to a Buyer\u2019s disclosure opt-in in accordance with GeoRiot\u2019s Data Retention Policy.\nThe purpose of retaining such information is for GeoRiot\u2019s internal management and administration or fulfillment of our legal responsibilities or protection of our legal interests.\nResidual User Agent information, which GeoRiot de-identifies to the standard of reidentification set forth under applicable law, may also remain within our databases, access logs, and other records.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Site

preferences.</p>\n<p>GeoRiot retains Personal Information about Client Users that is subject to a Client User\u2019s disclosure opt-out in accordance with GeoRiot\u2019s Data Retention Policy.\nThe purpose of retaining such information is for GeoRiot\u2019s internal management and administration or fulfillment of its legal responsibilities or protection of its legal interests.\nGeoRiot is not
