"Service Children's Privacy Policy", "url": "https://www.ixl.com/privacypolicy/servicechildrenprivacypolicy", "xpath": "//*[@id=\"bd\"]", "text": " <p>\n<b>Effective date:</b> July 1, 2020</p>\n<p>IXL does not permit children under the age of 13 (\"Child\") to create an account and does not knowingly collect personally identifying information from children under the age of 13 without the consent and at the direction of a parent.</p>\n<p>IXL permits Parents to set up child profiles associated with the Parent account so that children may access the Service under the Parent's supervision.\nWe take special precautions to collect only as much information as is reasonably necessary for the child to use the Service and to ensure that Parents have access to and control of their child's use of the Service.</p>\n<p>This Children's Privacy Policy applies to all users of child profiles associated with a Parent account, regardless of the age of the child.</p>\n<p>By creating a child profile associated with a Parent account and permitting your child to use the IXL Service, you expressly agree to the practices described in this Children's Privacy Policy and you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your child's personal information as described herein.</p> 1.\nHow to create a child profile associated with a Parent account.\n<p>A parent must purchase a user license using a credit card on the Family Membership page, register for an account with IXL, and agree to the terms of our Terms of Service, Privacy Policy and this Children's Privacy Policy.\nDuring the account creation process, the Parent may create individual profiles for each child(ren) authorized by the Parent to use the Service through the Parent's account.\nEach child user profile must be associated with a Parent account, and children cannot access the Service without the Parent first signing in to the Parent account with the Parent's login credentials.\nAfter the Parent logs into a Parent account, the child user selects the child profile to use the Service.</p> 2.\nWhat information does IXL collect from or about a child and how does IXL use this information? <p>\n<b>Information you provide us.</b> Through the Parent's account set-up, the Parent provides information about the child(ren) authorized by the Parent to use the Service through the Parent's account, including a profile name and selection of a profile avatar.\nWe recommend that the Parent selects a profile name that does not include the real name or identifying characteristics of the child.\nThe Parent may also create a \"secret word,\" which functions similar to a password to access the child profile, though it cannot be used to sign in to the Service without the Parent first signing in to the Parent's account using the Parent's login credentials.\nIXL does not request a birthdate or any additional personal information from the user of the child profile, though the child may change his/her profile avatar, secret word and profile name (of course, the Parent will see these changes through the Parent's account dashboard).\n</p>\n<p>IXL uses this information to provide the Service to the user of the child profile.\nIXL uses the e-mail address provided by users of Parent accounts to communicate messages about the account, such as subscription notices and password resets, and the child user reports and awards.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Information collected from the Child's use of the Service.</b> During the course of providing the Service, we collect information about the user of the child profile's use of the Service and information submitted to the Service, such as answers to questions, for the purpose of providing feedback to the user and for compiling reports and awards.\n</p>\n<p>When your Child accesses the Service through the Parent's account, we automatically collect and store usage information as well as information about the device used by the Parent and Child to access the Service.\nFor example, we collect an IP address, location (at the city level), browser type, language preferences, and other information about the device used to access the Service, such as the device type, model and manufacturer and a unique identifier which allows us to uniquely identify your browser, device, or account, as well as account usage information such as the day/time stamp, referring/exit pages and URLs, pages viewed, and similar information.\nThis information is typically collected through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, web beacons, log files, and similar technology (collectively, \"tracking technologies\"), and we may use third party providers to collect this information on our behalf.\nThis data collection is explained in greater detail in Section 1 of our Privacy Policy under the sub-heading \"Information we receive when you use the Service.\"</p>\n<p>We use this information to secure and improve the Service, to provide personalized content and information, to remember you when you return to the Service at a later time or using a different device, to improve the Service, to save you time, to provide better technical support, to track website usage and other similar purposes.</p> 3.\nHow we disclose information <p>IXL may share or disclose a child's personal information as needed to provide our Service or with your consent or permission.\nFor example, we share information with our trusted vendors, third party service providers and individuals to provide services for us on our behalf, which may include analytics providers and hosting services.\nWe may also share personal information if we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request.\n(b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof.\n(c) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.\n(d) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of IXL, its users, or the public.\nor (e) as required or permitted by law.</p>\n<p>If IXL becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, change of control, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, personal information may be transferred or disclosed in connection with the business transaction, subject to any applicable laws.</p>\n<p>We may also share aggregate or de-identified information in a manner that cannot be reasonably used to identify an individual user.</p> 4.\nThird party tracking and online advertising on the Service <p>IXL does not display any targeted advertising on the Service.</p>\n<p>We work with third-party online advertising networks which use tracking technologies (such as cookies, web beacons and similar technologies) to collect information about visitors to direct targeted advertising on other websites or services.\nYou can learn more by referring to Section 4 of the IXL Privacy Policy called \"Third party tracking and online advertising,\" and by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance's resources at http://www.aboutads.info/choices and/or the Network Advertising Initiative's online resources, at http://www.networkadvertising.org.</p>\n<p>We take certain steps designed to avoid these third-party tracking technologies from collecting information from users of Child profiles for targeted advertising purposes, by taking steps to disable such tracking technologies once a subscriber to our Service (e.g., the Parent) logs into our Service, maintaining the preferences for as long as the subscriber is signed in, and by remembering these preferences the next time you return to our Service using the same browser or device.\nPlease note that we rely on cookies to identify whether you are a Subscriber and if you delete or block cookies you may also delete the IXL cookie which allows us to recognize returning users and prevent subscribers from receiving targeted IXL advertisements on other websites or services.\nThese preferences are unique to the browser or device you used to sign in to the Service.\nTherefore, third-party tracking technologies may be present if you navigate to certain pages of our website using a new browser or device until you sign in to your account on that browser or device.</p>\n<p>If you do not want to receive targeted advertising from IXL based on your visit to our website, you can use the below link to request that IXL take steps to prevent third-party advertising networks from using information about your visit to our website to display targeted IXL advertisements to you on other websites or services on behalf of IXL.\nIXL cannot, however, guarantee that such steps will eliminate all collection and/or display of targeted advertising, and it may take some time for your request to take effect.\nSuch requests will not prevent you from receiving contextual advertising or other types of advertisements that are displayed without taking into consideration whether you have previously visited www.ixl.com (for example, advertisements shown on the basis of a search term keyword).\nSuch requests will not stop the collection of information for purposes other than advertising (e.g., for website analytics).\nThis opt-out requires the setting of a cookie in your browser to record your request (and thus will no longer be effective if the required cookie is deleted), will be effective only in the browser from which you make the request, and will be effective for a maximum of one year from the request.\nIf you delete cookies, change your browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another operating system, you will need to make the request again.\nYou may make additional requests at any time.</p>\n<p> Click here to request not to have information about your visit to www.ixl.com tracked for the purpose of displaying targeted IXL advertisements on other sites or services.\n</p> 5.\nHow to access and delete your child's personal information <p>The Parent may review the information collected from the user of the child profile at any time by signing in to the Parent account.\nThe Parent may refuse to permit the further collection of the child user's information by no longer providing the child user access to the Service through the Parent's account.</p>\n<p>IXL will retain the personal information collected from and about the user of the child profile for as long as necessary to provide the Service and will de-identify or delete the personal information after the termination of the Parent's subscription account in accordance with our standard data retention policy or until we receive a deletion request.\nTo request deletion of personal information of a user of a child profile at any time, please contact us at compliance@ixl.com.</p> 6.\nOur practices involving Schools <p>When IXL is used by a School in an educational setting, the School may authorize IXL to collect information from a child under 13.\nIf you are a Parent whose child accesses the IXL Service through a School, please contact the child's School to request to access, review and/or delete your child's information.\nIXL will process such requests promptly as directed by the School.</p>\n<p>Please refer to Section 11 of the IXL Privacy Policy to learn more about how IXL protects Student Data, including Students who may be under the age of 13, when the Service is used by a School.</p> 7.\nRegion-Specific Disclosures <p>We may choose or be required by law to provide different or additional disclosures relating to the processing of personal information about residents of certain countries, regions or states.\nPlease refer to the Region-Specific Disclosures section of our Privacy Policy to learn more.</p> 8.\nContact us <p>If you have questions or concerns about this policy or about our use of information provided by a user of a child profile, please contact us:</p>\n<p>\n</p>IXL Learning, Inc.\n777 Mariners Island Blvd., Suite 600 San Mateo, CA 94404 (USA)

to you as described below.\nThis Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access or otherwise use the Service (\"you\" or \"Users\").\nIf you open an IXL account on behalf of a School, company, organization, or other entity, then \"you\" includes you and that entity.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>A note about Student Data:</b> This Service may be purchased by providers of educational services, such as schools, school districts, or teachers (collectively referred to as \"Schools\") that use our services for educational purposes.\nWhen IXL contracts with a School to provide the Service, we may collect or have access to Student Data (defined below), which may be provided by the School or by the student.\nWe consider such Student Data to be strictly confidential and in general do not use such data for any purpose other than improving and providing our Services to the School or on the school's behalf.\nOur collection, use and sharing of Student Data is governed by this Agreement and any applicable laws and regulations including, in the U.S., provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\"), the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (\"COPPA\") and applicable state laws, including without limitation the Illinois Student Online Personal Protection Act (SOPPA).</p>\n<p>\n<b>PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION.\nTHIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.</b>\n</p> 1.\nTHE SERVICE <p>The Service helps its users to learn and practice various subjects including mathematics, language arts, science, and social studies.\nUnless explicitly stated otherwise, any new or improved features to the Service shall be provided subject to this Agreement.\nYou understand and agree that the Service is provided \"as-is\" and that IXL assumes no responsibility for any mistakes, errors, or omissions, including any unavailability of the Service or deletion or loss of any data relating to the Service.</p>\n<p>IXL grants

otherwise attempt to discover any source code, sell, assign, sublicense, grant a security interest in or otherwise transfer any right in the Software.\nYou agree not to modify the Software in any manner or form, or to use modified versions of the Software, including (without limitation) for obtaining unauthorized access to the Service.\nYou agree not to access the Service by any means other than through the interface that is provided by IXL for use in accessing the Service.</p>\n<p>To use the Service, you must obtain access to the Internet, either directly or through devices that access web-based content, and pay any service fees or other costs associated with such access.\nIn addition, you must provide all equipment necessary to make such connection to the Internet, including a computer and modem or other access device.</p> 2.\nELIGIBILITY AND AUTHORITY <p>IXL does not sell the Service to children, but only to adults who can purchase the Service with a credit card or other permitted payment method.\nIf you are under eighteen (18) years of age, you may use the Service only with the involvement and consent of a parent, legal guardian, or at the direction of your School.\nYour School may impose additional policies regarding the use of the Service, with which you must comply.</p>\n<p>If you open an IXL account to provide the Service to students in a School, you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the School with the authority to bind the School to this Agreement, and that you agree to this Agreement on the School's behalf.\nIf you contact IXL to take any action with respect to an account, you represent and warrant that you have all necessary authority to request such action(s) from or on behalf of the account-holder (e.g., a School or Parent).</p>\n<p>The U.S.\nChildren's Online Privacy and Protection Act (\"COPPA\") requires that online service providers obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information from children under 13.\nIf you are a School providing the Service to children under 13, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to provide consent on behalf of parents for IXL to collect information from students under 13 before allowing such students to access our Service.\nWe recommend that all Schools provide appropriate disclosures to students and parents regarding their use of service providers such as IXL and that they provide a copy of our Privacy Policy and the IXL Learning Student Data Privacy Pledge to parents.</p> 3.\nYOUR REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS <p>In consideration of your use of the Service, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form (such information being the \"Registration Data\") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete.\nIf you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or IXL has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, IXL has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof).</p> 4.\nGENERAL ACCOUNT INFORMATION <p>IXL sells access to the Service to a subscriber in the form of an account.\nEach account is provided for a term and price subject to certain renewal, cancellation, and other terms and conditions specific to the account (the \"Account Terms\").\nThe Account Terms are identified (in order of precedence) in the then-current quote or sales contract for the account, the selections made and account-specific terms disclosed when signing up for the account (which may be confirmed by e-mail), the description of account terms accessible through the IXL website when signed in to an appropriate user associated with the account and the default Account Terms set forth below.\nEach account may have Account Terms in addition to or different from those as set forth in this Agreement, but only to the extent set forth in a signed writing by the account subscriber and an officer of IXL.</p>\n<p>IXL provides a variety of \"account types\" which may apply depending on the subscriber and the way an IXL account is created.\nEach account type has a default set of Account Terms which apply unless superseded as set forth above.\nIXL reserves the right to provision accounts that do not belong to any of these default account types and/or to provision accounts with different Account Terms regardless of its account type.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Account Types:</b>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Family Account \u2014 A family account is purchased by or for a Parent.\nFamily accounts are generally only available for purchase through the IXL website or a third-party app store using a credit card.\nA family account typically includes child profiles that can be used by a Parent's child at the Parent's direction.\nFamily account subscriptions are generally for a term of one month, six months, or one year.\nThe term is disclosed at the time of purchase.\nIf multiple terms are available, the term can be selected at the time of purchase or later changed by contacting help@ixl.com.\nFamily accounts automatically renew.\nSee Section 6 below for more information about automatic renewal and cancellation of automatically renewing accounts.\n</li>\n<li>Classroom Account \u2014 A classroom account is purchased by or on behalf of a school, such as by a teacher.\nClassroom accounts may generally be purchased either through the IXL website, or by phone or e-mail.\nA classroom account typically includes a single teacher user and a small number of student users (which may vary depending on the purchase).\nA classroom account is typically for a term of one year.\nThe term is disclosed at the time of purchase.\nClassroom accounts do not automatically renew.\nAction must be taken by the school or its authorized representative (e.g., teacher) to renew and continue using a classroom account past the end of the term.\nA classroom account is a type of school account.\nMore information relating to school accounts may be found in Section 5 below.</li>\n<li>Site Account \u2014 A site account is purchased by or on behalf of a school or school district.\nSite accounts may be purchased by phone or e-mail.\nA site account typically includes an unlimited number of teacher users and a set maximum number of student users (which may vary depending on the purchase).\nA site account may be for a term of one year or longer.\nThe term is disclosed at the time of purchase.\nSite accounts do not automatically renew.\nAction must be taken by the school or its authorized representative (e.g., school administrator) to renew and continue using a site account past the end of the term.\nA site account is a type of school account.\nMore information relating to school accounts may be found in Section 5 below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>Quotes and Proposals:</b> Any quotes or proposals provided by IXL are valid only for a limited time and are effective only with the agreement of the relevant parties.\nQuotes and proposals may be withdrawn by IXL at any time in its sole discretion.\nQuotes and proposals may include information that is proprietary and confidential to IXL and to the maximum extent permitted by law may not be disclosed to anyone other than their intended recipient.\nBy requesting and/or accepting receipt of a quote or proposal from IXL you agree to keep such quotes or proposals confidential, to not disclose such quotes or proposals to any third party, and to immediately return and/or destroy all quote and proposal materials upon receiving a request to do so from IXL.\nTo the extent that public records laws may apply to a quote or proposal provided by IXL, you agree to immediately notify IXL of any public records request that may result in disclosure of an IXL quote or proposal and provide IXL all reasonable opportunities to take steps to prevent such disclosure to the maximum extent permitted by law and will reasonably cooperate with IXL.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Payments:</b> School accounts have the option to make payment by credit card, check, or other methods at IXL's discretion (contact us for details).\nPayment must be received by IXL no later than 30 days after IXL issues an invoice.\nIf IXL does not receive payment within 30 days, the invoice is past due and IXL reserves the right to suspend access to the affected school account(s) and take collection action.\nSuspension of an account does not relieve the account-holder of its obligation to pay for the account.\nIXL reserves the right to charge a late fee in the amount of 1% per month or the maximum permitted by law and its reasonable attorney's fees in securing payment of past due amounts.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Cancellation:</b> Except as set forth below or otherwise agreed by IXL in a signed writing, accounts may not be canceled until the end of the current term of the account.\nUnless otherwise provided for herein, all cancellations requested before the end of the then-current term will be effective at the end of the current term.\n</p>\n<p>IXL permits early cancellations only in the following circumstances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the event that the Service is permanently discontinued.</li>\n<li>IXL otherwise permits early cancellations only to the extent required by applicable law.\nIn the event of such an early cancellation, the parties agree that the account-holder is responsible for all amounts due and payable before the date of early cancellation without pro-ration or to the greatest extent permitted by law.\nThe parties agree that IXL's efforts in selling, provisioning and providing an account are front-loaded and for that reason, pro-ration of fees in the event of early cancellation is not necessary or appropriate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>End of Subscription:</b> When an account subscription ends (e.g., at the end of the term if the account has not been renewed or has been canceled), the account no longer permits access to the Service.\nHowever, IXL may, at its sole discretion, permit continued, limited access for users of the Account for a limited time after the conclusion of the term.\nThe Service includes built-in capabilities to download and export information relating to the account.\nIf an account-holder or any of its users wishes to save or maintain any data, it is the account-holder and its user's sole obligation to download such data before the conclusion of the term.\nOnce the term of an account ends, IXL may delete data relating to an account in accordance with this Agreement and the Privacy Policy.\nIt is the account-holder's sole responsibility to request renewal of accounts that do not automatically renew to maintain continued access to the account and its associated data.\n</p> 5.\nSCHOOL ACCOUNTS AND STUDENT DATA <p>This Section 5 applies to a School's use of the Service.</p>\n<p>When IXL is used by a School for an educational purpose, IXL may collect or have access to Student Data that is provided by the School or by a student.\n\"Student Data\" is personal information that is directly related to an identifiable student and may include \"educational records\" as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\").</p>\n<p>The School or the student, and not IXL, owns and controls the Student Data.\nYou authorize IXL to access, collect, transmit, modify, display and store Student Data to provide the Service and as described in this Agreement and in our Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Compliance with Laws.</b> In the U.S., IXL may collect and process Student Data as a School Official with a legitimate educational interest pursuant to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\"), 20 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1232(g).\nIndividually and collectively, we and our School Users agree to uphold our obligations under FERPA, COPPA, the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (\"PPRA\"), applicable State laws relating to student data privacy, and with all other laws and regulations governing the protection of Student Data.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Use of Student Data.</b> By submitting, providing us access to, or causing us to receive Student Data, you agree that IXL may use the Student Data for the purposes of (i) providing the Service, (ii) improving and developing our Service, (iii) enforcing our rights under these Terms, and (iv) as permitted with the School's or the User's consent.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Use of De-Identified or Anonymized Student Data.</b> You agree that both before and after the term of the Agreement, IXL may collect, analyze, use, and retain data derived from Student Data as well as data about users' access and use of the Service, for the purpose of operating, analyzing, improving or marketing the Service, developing new products or services, conducting research or other purposes, provided that IXL may not share or publicly disclose information that is derived from Student Data unless such data is de-identified and/or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably identify a specific individual.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Use of Personal Information for Marketing.</b> You agree that IXL may provide customized content, advertising, and commercial messaging to school, teacher or district administrative users and other non-student users from time to time, provided that such advertisements shall not be based on Student Data.\nFor emphasis, and without limitation, IXL shall never use Student Data to engage in targeted advertising.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Disclosure of Student Data and Third-Party Service Providers.</b> You acknowledge and agree that IXL may provide access to Student Data to our employees and service providers which have a legitimate need to access such information to provide their services to us.\nWe and our employees, affiliates, service providers, or agents involved in the handling, transmittal, and processing of Student Data will be required to maintain the confidentiality of such data.\nIXL shall not share Student Data with third parties other than as described in this Agreement and in the IXL Privacy Policy, or with consent of the School or parent.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Student Data Access and Deletion Requests.</b> You may request that we delete Student Data in our possession at any time by providing such a request in writing, and we shall comply with such request within thirty (30) days, except that IXL shall not be required to delete Student Data that has been moved to a personal family account on the Service or as otherwise prohibited by law.\nA parent or student over the age of 18 seeking to access, modify, correct, or delete personal information in a student account that is connected to a School account will be instructed to contact the School to discuss data deletion or modification.\nIXL is not required to delete data that has been derived from Student Data if such data is de-identified and/or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably identify a specific individual.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Data Security and Breach Notification.</b> We have implemented administrative, physical and technical safeguards designed to secure the personal information in IXL's possession and control from unauthorized access, disclosure and use.\nIf an unauthorized party gains access to or has been disclosed Student Data (a \"Security Event\"), that we have collected or received through the Service under this Agreement, we will promptly notify the School.\nIf, due to a Security Event which is caused by the acts or omissions of IXL or its agents, a notification to an individual, organization or government agency is required under applicable privacy laws, the School shall be responsible for the timing, content, and method of any such legally-required notice and compliance with such laws and IXL shall indemnify the School for reasonable costs related to legally-required notifications.\nWith respect to any Security Event which is not caused by the acts or omissions of IXL or its agents, IXL shall reasonably cooperate with School's investigation of the Security Event, as School requests, at School's reasonable expense, but IXL shall not indemnify a School for costs associated with the Security Event.\nIXL shall be responsible for the timing, content, cost and method of notice and compliance with such laws as they relate to users that are not associated with a School account.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>State Specific Terms.</b> The following additional terms may apply depending on the state a School is located: </p>\n<p>\n<b>5.1 Connecticut</b>\n</p>\n<p>This Section 5.1 applies to the use of the Service by Schools located in the State of Connecticut.\nThe purpose of this Section 5.1 is to document compliance with applicable Connecticut state laws that may apply to the use of the Service by Schools in Connecticut, such as Conn.\nGen.\nStat.\nAnn.\n\u00a7 10-234aa-dd.\nThis Section 5.1 incorporates by reference the definitions set forth in Conn.\nGen.\nStat.\nAnn.\n\u00a7 10-234aa.</p>\n<p>If you open an IXL account to provide the Service to students in a School located in the State of Connecticut, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so on behalf of the local or regional board of education with authority over the School and that you are authorized to communicate with IXL on behalf of the local or regional board of education.</p>\n<p>IXL and you shall comply with all applicable sections of Conn.\nGen.\nStat.\nAnn.\n\u00a7 10-234aa-dd.\nThe following terms shall apply as required by Conn.\nGen.\nStat.\nAnn.\n\u00a7 10-234bb.\nTo the extent that any such required terms conflict with other terms in this Agreement, the terms of this Section 5.1 shall apply.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Student information, student records and student-generated content are not the property of or under the control of IXL.</li>\n<li>The local or regional board of education may request the deletion of any student information, student records or student-generated content in the possession of IXL by sending a request to compliance@ixl.com.\nAs permitted by Conn.\nGen.\nStat.\nAnn.\n\u00a7 10-234bb(2), IXL is not required to delete information prohibited from deletion or required to be retained under state or federal law or stored as a copy as part of a disaster recovery storage system and that is (i) inaccessible to the public, and (ii) unable to be used in the normal course of business by the contractor.\nIXL will, however, comply with requests for deletion of student information, student, records, or student-generated content that is restored from such disaster recovery storage systems.</li>\n<li>IXL will not use student information, student

other witnesses.\nand (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process.\nAny judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nNothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing IXL from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.\n</p> 23.\nCLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER <p>WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR

Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<b>A note about Student Data:</b> This Service may be purchased by providers of educational services, such as schools, school districts, or teachers (collectively referred to as \"Schools\") that use our services for educational purposes.\nWhen IXL contracts with a School to provide the Service, we may collect or have access to Student Data (defined below), which may be provided by the School or by the student.\nWe consider such Student Data to be strictly confidential and in general do not use such data for any purpose other than improving and providing our Services to the School or on the school's behalf.\nOur collection, use and sharing of Student Data is governed by our contracts with the School and any applicable laws and regulations including, in the U.S., provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\"), the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (\"COPPA\") and applicable state laws, including without limitation the Illinois

11 to understand the principles which guide our collection, use and disclosure of Student Data.\n</p> 1.\nWhat information does IXL collect about you? <p>IXL collects information in several ways from different parts of the Service.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Information you provide to us.</b> The type of personal information we collect may vary depending on your account type.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>School Information.</b> When a teacher, school administrator, or other authorized person associated with a School registers for an account on our Service or corresponds with us, we may collect personal information such as a name, e-mail address, payment information, username and password, and information about the School.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Student Information.</b> Once registered, a School may provide information about its students, such as student names or other identifiers, passwords, e-mail address for the student or the student's parent or legal guardian, and educational level and topic of study.\nPersonal information collected from or about students, along with other information associated with that personal information is \"<b>Student Data</b>.\" The School may elect to provide user names or identifiers which are not readily identifiable to anyone outside of the School community in lieu of a full student name, at its discretion.\nAdditionally, some Schools may elect to use a single-sign on (SSO) service like G Suite for Education rather than usernames and passwords to authenticate student access.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Parent and Child Information.</b> When a parent or guardian (\"Parent\") registers for an account on our Service or corresponds with us, we may collect personal information such as a name, e-mail address, payment information, username and password.\nWe may also collect information about the child(ren) authorized by the Parent to use the Service through the Parent's account, including a profile name for the child user and selection of a profile avatar.\nEach child user profile must be associated with a Parent account, and children cannot access the Service without the Parent first signing in to the Parent account with the Parent's sign in credentials.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Learning and Activity Information.</b> During the course of providing the Service, we collect information about your use of the Service, as well as any information that you submit to the Service, such as answers to questions or content or messages posted or shared through the Service.\nIn addition, we may ask you for personal information at other times, such as when you contact our technical support team, send us an e-mail, complete a user survey or otherwise communicate with IXL.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>Information we receive automatically from your use of our Service.</b> Like most websites and online services, IXL and our vendors automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit www.ixl.com, read our e-mails, use our Service or otherwise engage with us.\nThis information is typically collected through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, web beacons, Locally Stored Objects (LSOs such as Flash or HTML5), log files, and similar technology (collectively, \"tracking technologies\"), and we may use third party providers to collect this information on our behalf.\nThese tracking technologies collect information about how you access and use the Service (e.g., referring / exit pages and URLs, how frequently you access the Service, the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions you take on the Service).\ninformation about your browser and information about the device(s) you use to access the Service (e.g., Internet Protocol (IP address), browser type, browser language, Internet service provider, device type, model and manufacturer, a unique ID that allows us to uniquely identify your browser, device or account, operating system brand and model, and whether you access the Service from multiple devices).\nWe may also collect information about your geographical location data at the city level.\nWe may collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service and to understand more about the demographics and behaviors of our users.\nYou can learn more about Google's practices at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners.\nWe may also work with third party partners to employ technologies, including the application of statistical modeling tools, which permit us to recognize and contact you across multiple devices.\nAlthough we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our users, we are unable to respond to Do Not Track signals set by your browser at this time.\n</p>\n<p>We use or may use the data collected through tracking technologies to secure the Service, improve the Service, to save you time, to provide better technical support, for promotional purposes, and to track website usage.\nFor example, tracking technologies help us to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Keep track of whether you are signed in or have previously signed in so that we can display all the features that are available to you.</li>\n<li>Remember your settings on the pages you visit, so that we can display your preferred content the next time you visit.</li>\n<li>Customize the function and appearance of the pages you visit based on information relating to your account.\nfor example, to default you to a particular grade level, or to remember customized settings for a report.</li>\n<li>Track website usage for various purposes including website optimization, website improvement, sales, marketing, and billing.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.\nHowever, some features and services (particularly those that require you to sign in) may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.\nYou may also set your e-mail options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our e-mail and performed certain functions with it.\nDeleting cookies does not prevent the collection of information through non-cookie technologies and does delete Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as Flash objects and HTML5.\nYou can learn more about Flash objects \u2014 including how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies \u2014 on Adobe's website

and maintain the Service.</b> We use the information we collect to deliver the Service to you.\nFor example, we need to use your information to process payments, personalize learning curriculums, provide Schools, Parents and students with information and reports about student and child performance and use of the Service, respond to inquiries and provide customer support.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>To improve, personalize, and develop the Service.</b> We use information to tailor the content and information that we may send or display to users, to offer personalized content and instructions, and to

Service, monitor the effectiveness of our Service, detect usage patterns, and to diagnose or fix technology problems.\nWe also use information to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Service and perform research, and to develop, support, and improve our Service and other educational products and services.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>To communicate with you.</b> We use your information to provide

or other subscription notices.\nFrom time to time, we may send periodic promotional or informational e-mails to School or Parent users.\nWe do not use Student Data to send marketing communications, and we do not send marketing communications to student or child users.\nYou may opt-out of certain communications (e.g., marketing or certain notifications about your use of the Service) by following the opt-out instructions contained in the e-mail.\nYou may not opt out of service-related communications (e.g., account verification, transactional communications, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices).\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>To promote safety and security and respond to legal process.</b> We use information to promote the safety and security of our Service, our uses and other third parties.\nFor example, we may use the information to authenticate users, facilitate secure payments, detect and prevent fraud and other harmful activities, respond to legal requests or claims, and enforce our terms and policies.\n</p> 3.\nHow does IXL share your information? <p>IXL may share or disclose your personal information as needed to provide our Service or with your consent or permission.\nWe may also share personal information in the circumstances described below.</p>\n<p> Third parties with Consent or as Instructed We share information with consent and at the direction of Schools and Parents.\nFor example, a School or Parent may direct IXL to share specific information with another individual, such as when a teacher directs IXL to send a communication to a parent.\nSimilarly, we may share personal information with third parties, for example, if a School authorizes Google login or similar authentication tools for that School's user accounts.\n</p>\n<p> Others within the School.\nIXL may share information collected from users associated with a School with other users or persons designated by the School, such as teachers and school administrators of that School.\nMessages and content shared or posted by members of a School community, such as messages between a teacher and students in a class, will be accessible by School administrators or other designated School users.\n</p>\n<p> Vendors and Service Providers.\nIXL may share information with our trusted vendors, third party service providers and individuals to provide services or products for us or on our behalf, which may include analytics, hosting, billing, targeted advertising, and marketing (provided however, that IXL will not knowingly use any Student Data to target advertising or marketing).\nVendors and service providers who have access to Student Data, if any, shall be contractually bound to uphold privacy and confidentiality terms no less protective than those provided herein.\n</p>\n<p> Aggregate or De-Identified Information.\nWe may share information in aggregated and/or anonymous form that cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual.\nFor example, IXL may disclose aggregated user statistics (i.e., the total number or percentage of IXL users from a particular geographic region) in order to describe our Service to current and prospective partners and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.\n</p>\n<p> Merger or Sale.\nIf IXL becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, change of control, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, your personal information may be transferred or disclosed in connection with the business transaction.\nIn such an event, we will make efforts to provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\nWe will not transfer Student Data associated with School accounts in the event of a merger or sale unless the recipient has committed to The Student Privacy Pledge principles or similarly stringent privacy protections, or we will provide Schools with notice and an opportunity to opt-out of the transfer of Student Data by terminating their accounts and any associated student users before the transfer occurs.\n</p>\n<p> Other.\nIXL may release personal information if it has a good faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request.\n(b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof.\n(c) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.\n(d) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of IXL, its users, or the public.\nor (e) as required or permitted by law.\n</p> 4.\nThird-party tracking and online advertising <p>IXL does not display any targeted advertising on the Service.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Please note that although we may permit third party advertising partners to collect information from visitors to adult-directed areas of the Service for the purpose of displaying advertisements on other websites or online services on our behalf, we take many steps to prevent these third-party advertising networks from collecting information for targeted advertising purposes once a subscriber to our Service signs into our Service.\nPlease note that we rely on cookies to identify whether you are a subscriber to our Service and if you delete or block cookies, you may also delete the IXL cookie which prevents subscribers from receiving targeted IXL advertisements on other websites or online services.</b>\n</p>\n<p> We work with third-party online advertising networks which use technology to recognize your browser or device and to collect certain types of usage information about your visit to or use of our Service to provide customized content, advertising and commercial messages to you on other websites or services, or on other devices you may use.\nWe (through the third-party advertising networks) use this information to direct our online advertisements to those people who may find them relevant to their interests.\nTypically, though not always, the information is collected through cookies or similar tracking technologies.\nYou may be able to set your browser to reject cookies or other tracking technology by actively managing the settings on your browser or mobile device, though these tools may not be effective for all third-party tracking technologies, including Flash or HTML5 cookies.\nTo learn more about cookies, clear gifs/web beacons and online advertising technologies and how you may opt-out of some of this advertising, you may wish to visit the Digital Advertising Alliance's resources at www.aboutads.info/choices and/or the Network Advertising Initiative's online resources, at www.networkadvertising.org.\n</p>\n<p> If you do not want to receive targeted advertising from IXL based on your visit to our website, you can use the below link to request that IXL take steps to prevent third-party advertising networks from using information about your visit to our website to display targeted IXL advertisements to you on other websites or services on behalf of IXL.\nIXL cannot, however, guarantee that such steps will eliminate all collection and/or display of targeted advertising, and it may take some time for your request to take effect.\nSuch requests will not prevent you from receiving contextual advertising or other types of advertisements that are displayed without taking into consideration whether you have previously visited www.ixl.com (for example, advertisements shown on the basis of a search term keyword).\nSuch requests will not stop the collection of information for purposes other than advertising (e.g., for website analytics).\nThis opt-out requires the setting of a cookie in your browser to record your request (and thus will no longer be effective if the required cookie is deleted), will be effective only in the browser from which you make the request, and will be effective for a maximum of one year from the request.\nIf you delete cookies, change your browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another operating system, you will need to make the request again.\nYou may make additional requests at any time.\n</p>\n<p> Click here to request not to have information about your visit to www.ixl.com tracked for the purpose of displaying targeted IXL advertisements on other sites or services.\n</p> 5.\nHow to control e-mail communications <p> IXL may, from time to time, send you e-mail regarding our products and services, or your use of our products and services.\nOnly IXL (or its vendors or service providers operating on its behalf) will send you these e-mails.\nYou can choose not to receive these e-mails by clicking the unsubscribe link in any e-mail or by contacting help@ixl.com.\nPlease note that you are not permitted to unsubscribe or opt-out of non-promotional messages regarding your account, such as account verification, changes or

signing in to your account, clicking on the account menu in the upper-right corner, and selecting Profile &amp.\nsettings.\nWe recommend that you review your personal information periodically to ensure that it is accurate, complete, and current.\nIf you do not provide and maintain accurate contact information for your account, we may not be able to provide you with the notices set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>If you are a parent or guardian of a student who uses the IXL Service through a School, please refer all questions and requests regarding access, modification, or deletion of your student's user account or Student Data to your child's school.\nThe School may, at its discretion, address such requests with IXL and IXL shall respond promptly to all access, modification and deletion requests it receives from Schools.</p>\n<p> Please contact compliance@ixl.com for further instructions about deleting or deactivating your account or deleting your personal information.\nWe may not be able to comply with your request in all circumstances.\nFor example, certain requests to access, update or delete personal information and data associated with a School account or license may be subject to approval by the School.\nWhen account information is deleted or de-identified, certain residual information may remain within our archive records, such as for customer and technical support, billing and tax purposes.\n</p> 7.\nHow long does IXL retain your information? <p>We will retain personal information for as long as needed to provide the Service and for our internal business purposes, which may extend beyond the termination or cancellation of your subscription or user account.\nFor example, we may retain certain data as necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, for recordkeeping or other legitimate business purposes, or if required by law.\nWe may also retain and use information which has been de-identified or aggregated such that it can no longer reasonably identify a particular individual.\nAll retained personal information will remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p> Student Data.\nWe will not knowingly retain Student Data beyond the time period required to support an educational purpose, unless authorized by a School or parent.\nWe do not delete or de-identify any Student Data from an active student user account associated with a School except at the direction of the School.\nThe School is responsible for maintaining current student rosters and identifying Student Data which the School no longer needs for an educational purpose by removing students from the school's master roster or by submitting a deletion request.\n</p>\n<p> Unless otherwise directed by a School or Parent, we will delete or de-identify personal information of student and child users after a period of inactivity, after the termination or cancellation of the license subscription, or after termination of our agreement with the School, in accordance with the terms of any applicable written agreement with the School, written requests from authorized School administrators, and our standard data retention schedule.\nAuthorized School administrators may contact us at compliance@ixl.com to request additional information about our standard data retention schedule and available options for customizing IXL's standard data retention schedule to meet individual School requirements.\n</p>\n<p>We may not be able to immediately or completely delete all data in all instances, such as information retained in technical support records, customer service records, backups, and other similar business records.\nWe will not be required to delete any information which has been de-identified or disassociated with personal identifiers such that the remaining information cannot reasonably be used to identify a particular individual.</p> 8.\nHow does IXL protect your information? <p>\n<b>Information Security.</b> The security of your personal information is very important to us.\nWe have implemented a variety of physical, administrative and technological safeguards designed to preserve the integrity and security of the personal information we collect and to protect against unauthorized access to data.\nThese include internal reviews of our data collection, storage, and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.\nWe restrict access to personal information to IXL employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our services.\nOur employees may be subject to disciplinary action, including termination, if they fail to meet privacy and confidentiality obligations.\nHowever, no security system is impenetrable\u2014for that reason, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.\nIf personal information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and take all steps required by applicable laws and regulations and our agreements with any affected Schools.\n</p>\n<p>Maintaining the security of your personal information also requires your cooperation and involvement.\nFor your protection, remember to sign out of all accounts before closing your browser.\nThere is a sign out link available on most IXL pages.\nAfter signing out, make sure to close all browser windows.\nIn addition, do not use the \"Remember\" feature if you are signing in to your account from a computer that other persons may have access to.\nThis is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information if you share a computer with someone else or are using a public computer.</p>\n<p> Please keep your password secure.\nIf you have forgotten your password, you may request a new one by contacting help@ixl.com.\nA new password will be sent to the e-mail address you specified during registration.\nFor all other problems signing in to the IXL Service, please contact our technical support team using the contact information at the end of this policy.\n</p>\n<p> If you have any concerns about the security of your account or the security of the Service, we ask that you report your concern to us immediately at security@ixl.com.\nWhile we are unable to respond to all security concerns, we appreciate your feedback and take all reported concerns seriously.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Data storage and transfer.</b> IXL is located in the United States.\nPersonal information collected through our Website and Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which IXL or its affiliates or service providers maintain facilities.\n</p> 9.\nRegion-specific disclosures <p>We may choose or be required by law to provide different or additional disclosures relating to the processing of personal information about residents of certain countries, regions or states.\nPlease refer below for disclosures that may be applicable to you.</p>\n<b>Notice for California Residents</b>\n<p> This section applies to you if you are a resident of the state of California and for purposes of this section the term \"personal information\" has the meaning provided by the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \"CCPA\").\nPlease note this section does not apply to Student Data that we process on behalf of our School customers.\nBecause IXL provides the Services to Schools as a \"School Official,\" we collect, retain, use and disclose Student Data only for or on behalf of our School customers for the purpose of providing the Services specified in our agreement with the School and for no other commercial purpose.\nIf you have any questions or would like to exercise your California rights, please contact your School directly.\n</p>\n<p>Residents of California may be entitled to certain rights with respect to personal information that we have collected about them under the CCPA:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Right to Know.</b> The right to request to know more about the specific pieces or categories of personal information we have collected, the categories of data sources, and the categories of third parties with whom we have shared the personal information for a business or commercial purpose in the last 12 months.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Right to Request Deletion.</b> The right to request the deletion of personal information that we have collected from you, subject to certain exceptions.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Right to Opt Out of Personal Information Sales.</b> The right to direct us not to sell (as such term is defined by the CCPA) personal information we have collected about you to third parties.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You also have the right to be free of discrimination for exercising these rights.\nHowever, please note that if the exercise of these rights limits our ability to process personal information (such as in the case of a deletion request), we may no longer be able to provide you the Service or engage with you in the same manner.</p>\n<p>To request to exercise your right to know and/or right to deletion, please submit a request by emailing compliance@ixl.com with the subject line, \"California Rights Request.\" We will need to verify your identity before processing your request, which may require us to request additional personal information from you or require you to log into your account, if you have one.\nIn certain circumstances, we may decline or limit your request, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or locate your information in our systems, or as permitted by law.</p>\n<p>We do not \"sell\" personal information to third parties without consent, however, we do allow certain third party advertising networks and other third party businesses to collect your personal information directly from your browser or device through cookies and related technologies for advertising, attribution, analytics and research purposes.\nThese third parties may use such personal information for their own purposes in accordance with their own privacy statements, which may include reselling this information to additional third parties.\nBy visiting www.privacyrights.info, you can opt out from sales of this type of personal information by businesses that participate in the DAA's CCPA App-based Opt-Out Tool.</p>\n<p>Please see the section called \"<b>Third-party tracking and online advertising</b>\" for more information about how third parties use cookies and related technologies to collect information automatically on our websites and other online services, and the choices you may have in relation to those activities.</p>\n<p> Shine the Light.\nCalifornia \"Shine the Light\" law (Civil Code Section \u00a71798.83) provides certain rights to California residents that have an established business relationship with us with regard to the disclosure of certain types of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.\nWe do not share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes without consent.\n</p>\n<p> Minors.\nWe do not sell the personal information of consumers we know to be less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the \"Right to Opt In\") from either the minor who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a minor less than 13 years of age.\n</p>\n<b>Notice for Nevada Residents</b>\n<p>To exercise your individual rights under the Nevada Privacy Law (NRS Ch.\n603A, Sec.\n2(2)), please contact us at compliance@ixl.com.\nPlease include \"Nevada Rights Request\" in the subject line.</p>\n<b>Notice for Residents in the European Economic Area (\"EEA\") Residents</b>\n<p>For personal information subject to the European Union General Data Processing Regulation (\"GDPR\"), we rely on several legal bases to process the data.\nThese legal bases include where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The processing is necessary to perform our contractual obligations in our Terms of Service or other contracts with you (such as to provide you the Service as described in our Terms of Service);</li>\n<li>You have given your prior consent, which you may withdraw at any time (such as for marketing purposes or other purposes we obtain your consent for from time to time);</li>\n<li>The processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, a court order or to exercise or defend legal claims;</li>\n<li>The processing is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests, such as in improving, personalizing, and developing the Service, marketing the Service, such as new features or products that may be of interest, and promoting safety and security as described above.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have any questions about or would like further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided below in Section 14.</p>\n<p>Residents in the EEA are entitled to certain rights with respect to personal information that we hold about them under the GDPR:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Right of access and portability.</b> The right to obtain access to your personal information, along with certain related information, and to receive that information in a commonly used format and to have it transferred to another data controller.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Right to rectification.</b> The right to obtain rectification of your personal information without undue delay where that personal information is inaccurate or incomplete.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Right to erasure.</b> The right to obtain the erasure of your personal information without undue delay in certain circumstances, such as where the personal information is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or processed.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Right to restriction.</b> The right to obtain the restriction of the processing undertaken by us on your personal information in certain circumstances, such as where the accuracy of the personal information is contested by you, for a period enabling us to verify the accuracy of that personal information.\nand </li>\n<li>\n<b>Right to object.</b> The right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of your personal information, and to object to processing of your personal information for direct marketing purposes, to the extent it is related to such direct marketing.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may also have the right to make a GDPR complaint to the relevant Supervisory Authority.\nA list of Supervisory Authorities is available here: https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.\nIf you need further assistance regarding your rights, please contact us using the contact information provided below and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable law.\nIn some cases our ability to uphold these rights for you may depend upon our obligations to process personal information for security, safety, fraud prevention reasons, compliance with regulatory or legal requirements, or because processing is necessary to deliver the services you have requested.\nWhere this is the case, we will inform you of specific details in response to your request.</p> 10.\nHow does IXL protect children's privacy? <p>IXL does not permit children under the age of 13 to create an account and does not knowingly collect personally identifying information from children under the age of 13 without the consent and at the direction of a Parent.\nPlease contact us at compliance@ixl.com if you believe we have inadvertently collected information from a child under 13 without parental consent so that we may delete the information as soon as possible.</p>\n<p> Parents who purchase a subscription to the IXL Service may set up a Child profile associated with the Parent's account so that children under 13 may access the Service under the Parent's supervision.\nPlease see our IXL Service Children's Privacy Policy to learn more about how IXL collects, uses and shares information associated with Child profiles.\nThe Children's Privacy Policy applies to all users of Child profiles, regardless of the age of the Child.\n</p>\n<p>When IXL is used by a School in an educational setting, the School may authorize IXL to collect information from a child under 13.\nPlease refer to Section 11 to learn more about how IXL protects Student Data, including Students who may be under the age of 13, when the Service is used by a School.</p> 11.\nHow does IXL protect Student Data and comply with laws? <p> When IXL provides the Service to Schools, our collection, use and disclosure of Student Data is governed by our Terms of Service and/or any other agreement with the School, by the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\"), the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (\"COPPA\") and other applicable laws that may relate to the collection and use of personal information of students.\nIf you have any questions about our collection and use of Student Data, please contact us at compliance@ixl.com.\nIf you have any questions about reviewing, modifying, or deleting the personal information of a student, please contact your School directly.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>The Student Privacy Pledge (\"The Pledge\").</b> IXL adheres to the Student Privacy Pledge, an industry standard approach to privacy for K-12 service providers.\nThe Pledge was created by the Future of Privacy Forum (FPF) and The Software &amp.\nInformation Industry Association (SIIA) and has been endorsed by the National School Boards Association (NSBA), the National Parent-Teacher Association (PTA), and the White House.\n</p>\n<p>As part of our commitment to The Pledge, when we have access to Student Data through the provision of our Services to a School, the following core principles guide our decisions around data, security, and technology:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IXL does not collect, maintain, use or share Student Data beyond that needed for an authorized educational or school purpose, or as authorized by our agreement with a School.</li>\n<li>IXL does not use or disclose Student Data for targeted advertising purposes.</li>\n<li>IXL does not build a personal profile of a Student other than in furtherance of a K-12 School purpose, or as authorized by a parent.</li>\n<li>IXL will maintain a comprehensive data security program designed to protect the types of Student Data maintained by IXL.</li>\n<li>IXL will not knowingly retain Student Data beyond the time period required to support the School's purpose, unless authorized by the parent.</li>\n<li>IXL will clearly and transparently disclose our data policies and practices.</li>\n<li>IXL will never sell Student Data unless the sale is part of a corporate transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other sale of assets, in which case we will use our best efforts to ensure the successor entity honors the privacy commitments made in this policy and/or we will notify the School of such a sale and provide the School an opportunity to opt-out by terminating its account before the data transfer occurs.</li>\n<li>We will not make any material changes to our Privacy Policy or Terms of Service that relate to the collection or use of Student Data without first giving notice to the School and providing a choice before the Student Data is used in a materially different manner than was disclosed when the information was collected.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\").</b> This Privacy Policy and our Service are designed to meet our responsibilities to protect personal information from the students' educational records under FERPA.\nWe agree to work with each School to jointly ensure compliance with the FERPA regulations.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>The Children's Online Privacy

has authorized us to collect such information through the provision of the Service on the School's behalf.\nWhen a School uses our Service in the classroom or in an educational context, we rely on the School to provide appropriate consent and authorization for a student under 13 to use the Service and for IXL to collect personal information from such student, as permitted by COPPA.\nUpon request, we will provide the School the opportunity to review and delete the personal information collected from their students.\nIf you are a parent and you have questions about your child's use of our

Policy and our Service are designed to comply with SOPIPA.\nWe do not use Student Data for targeted advertising purposes.\nWe do not use collected information to amass a profile of a K-12 student except in furtherance of K-12 school purposes.\nWe never sell Student Data unless the sale is part of a corporate transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other sale of assets, in which case we make efforts to ensure the successor entity honors the privacy commitments made in this policy and/or we will notify you of such a sale and provide you an opportunity to opt-out by deleting your account before the data transfer occurs.\nWe will not sell students' personal information to third parties other than in the context of a business transaction.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>California Assembly Bill 1584 (\"AB 1584\").</b> This Privacy Policy and our Service are designed to comply with AB 1584.\nPupil records obtained by IXL from a local educational agency (\"LEA\") continue to be the property of and under the control of the LEA.\nParents, legal guardians, or eligible pupils may review personally identifiable information in the pupil's records and correct erroneous information

that you or your School has entered into a signed, written agreement with IXL, changes to this Policy may not be effective as to you until either (a) you or your School affirmatively accepts the changes to this Policy, either electronically or in a signed writing or (b) upon renewal of the School's agreement with IXL at the end of the current term.</p> 14.\nContact Us <p>If you have a
