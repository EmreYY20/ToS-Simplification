partners are working with National Grid ESO, the people who run the electricity network, to trial the <strong>National Grid\u2019s Demand Flexibility Service (\u201cNGDFS\u201d)</strong>, where households come together to use less energy at certain times \u2013 and get rewarded for their efforts.\nWhile your own home might only be a small drop in the ocean, every ocean is made up of many drops.\nso put enough of them together and they soon add up.&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Further details are available here</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>HUGO users can participate in between 21<sup>st</sup> November 2022 to 31<sup>st</sup> March 2023.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This mean we will pay you to reduce your electricity demand during certain periods this winter&nbsp.\n(\u201c<strong>Demand Events</strong>\u201c), mainly between the hours of 4-9pm when electricity demand peaks and grid carbon intensity levels are highest.\nPayments will vary, but we will try to estimate the payment for reducing each kWh that you would normally use.\nThe expected value of the service will be around \u00a33/kWh saved vs your normal consumption.&nbsp.\n&nbsp;So if during a Demand Event you would use 4 kWh and you end up using 2 kWh the payment would be \u00a36.&nbsp.\n&nbsp;We will split the \u00a33 with you on a 80% \u2013 20% basis.&nbsp.\n&nbsp;So you would get \u00a32.40 per kWh (less any deductions for money transfer fees in order to make a payment to your bank account).&nbsp.\n&nbsp;There will be a minimum of 12 Demand Events between November 2022 and March 2023, but it is likely there will be more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You don\u2019t have to participate in each one but only the ones that you find suitable.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nHow will the trial work?\n<p>Press the <strong>SETTINGS</strong> button (top right) in HUGO and there is a <strong>Winter Cashback</strong> Opt-In toggle button.&nbsp.\n&nbsp;up to 24 hours before each <strong>Demand Event</strong> we will notify you that a <strong>Winter Cashback</strong> period is starting.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nWhen you get this notification via email, SMS or via the APP the Winter Cashback button will become activated and allow you to Opt-In.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our notification will advise you of the time Demand Event and give you plenty of time to decide to take part and activate the Winter Cashback button.\nWe will also try to sent a reminder message just before the start of the Demand Event.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If your taking part we will read your smart meter data to measure your normal historic consumption (\u201c<strong>Baseline Consumption</strong>\u201c), and track how much you reduce demand during times when National Grid call on the service.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>HUGO and/or its Partners will calculate your <strong>Baseline Consumption</strong> using the BSC P376 \u2018Utilising a Baseline Methodology to set Physical Notifications\u2019 with an in-day adjustment for domestic customers.\nThis methodology looks at up to 10 days of your recent smart meter history, excluding days where a Session has taken place, to calculate your average consumption.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once we know how much <strong>Winter Cashback</strong> you have accumulated this credit will be added to the HUGO app for you to review in the CO2 section.&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nYou will need to reduce your demand by a minimum of&nbsp;25% during a <strong>Demand Event</strong> to earn any <strong>Winter Cashback</strong> money.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If for whatever reason you don\u2019t manage to reduce demand, during the Demand Event there are no penalties for not participating and no penalties for using more electricity during the Demand Event.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After each <strong>Demand Event</strong>, we and our partners will calculate how much you have reduced your <strong>Baseline Consumption</strong> by, during the <strong>Demand Event</strong>.&nbsp.\n&nbsp;The results will appear in the running total in HUGO CO2 section.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nWhat can I do to reduce electricity demand during an event?\n<p>Here\u2019s some great ideas for helping you get the most out of participating:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you use an electric oven / cooker, why not cook your dinner a bit earlier or later, or use a slow-cooker earlier in the day</li>\n<li>Turns lights down / off and have a candle-lit dinner</li>\n<li>Avoid using energy intensive appliances such as tumble driers, washing machines and dishwashers during the event</li>\n<li>If you have a heat-pump or electric heating, turn down your thermostat a few degrees for an hour</li>\n<li>If you have kids, get them off the TV and computer consoles for an hour and get some quality time back!</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t charge your electric car at this time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Rule of Participation for
