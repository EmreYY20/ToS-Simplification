initiating arbitration.\nSuch informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.\n</p>\n<b>Binding Arbitration\n</b>\n<p>If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved through binding arbitration.\nYOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.\nThe arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association(\"AAA\") and, where appropriate, the AAA\u2019s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (\"AAA Consumer Rules''), both of which are available at the AAA website: www.adr.org.\nYour arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.\nIf such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.\nThe arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online.\nThe arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party.\nThe arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.\nExcept where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in the United States, Delaware.\nExcept as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in United States, Delaware, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.\nApplication of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) is excluded from these Terms of Use.</p>\n<p>In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be commenced more than one (1) years after the cause of action arose.\nIf this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable, and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>\n<b>Restrictions</b>\n<p>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually.\nTo the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding.\n(b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures.\nand (c)there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>\n<b>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitratio</b>\n<p>The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party.\n(b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use.\nand (c) any claim for injunctive relief.\nIf this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.\n</p> 20.\nCORRECTIONS\n<p>There may be information on the Site that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions, including

TweetDelete <ul>\n<li> Home (current) </li>\n</ul> Privacy Policy\n<p>This policy describes how we hold and process your private information.\nIt applies to the services Tweetails, TweetDownload and TweetDelete that are operated by TD Social LLC.</p>\nOverview\n<p>We collect the minimum amount of personal information necessary for our services to function.\nThis is processed with your consent, or on another legal basis.\nWe don't sell any information to third parties, and we only use it as this privacy policy describes.</p> What information we collect and why <p>We collect various information related to your Twitter account from users who sign in to our website, such as your Twitter user ID, Twitter screen name, and access keys for the Twitter API.<br>\n<i>Why we collect this:</i> We need these details for our Twitter related services to function, and so that we can use Twitter API functions on your behalf in order to provide our services on your Twitter account.</p>\n<p>We collect or process certain additional data contained in your Twitter account (which could potentially contain sensitive data) where the functionality our service is providing requires it.\nThis could include your tweets or your direct messages.<br>\n<i>Why we collect this:</i> We only collect this type of data in order to provide a service you've asked us to.\nWe're careful to only hold it for as long as necessary.\nFor example TweetDelete needs to scan your tweets to work out which to delete, but they are normally used temporarily and are not stored in our database.\nCertain premium functionality does require storing tweets, for example when you have excluded certain tweets from deletion, or if you've uploaded a Twitter data file (those are automatically removed after 3 days).</p>\n<p>We collect various information about visitors to our website due to our use of common internet technologies such as web server logs.\nThis includes details like the visitor's browser type, language preference, referring site, additional websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor request.\nWe also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.<br>\n<i>Why we collect this:</i> We collect this information to understand how visitors use our websites, and to monitor and protect the security and stability of our websites.</p>\n<p>For paid services only, we collect related information such as payment amounts, times and currencies, and information related to customers, such as their names and addresses.<br>\n<i>Why we collect this:</i> We collect this information to validate and secure payments.\nWe also have a legal obligation to keep certain data e.g.\nfor tax calculation purposes.\nWe don't collect sensitive details such as credit card numbers (these are handled by our payment processor).</p>\n<p>We do not intentionally collect sensitive categories of data.\nBecause we process social media posts, there are situations where such data may pass through our service without our knowledge.</p> How we share the information we collect\n<p>We do not sell any information to third parties.\nWe do not share any information with third parties unless a service you've requested necessitates this (for example if you want to share your results page on Tweetails).\n</p>Global privacy practices\n<p>We store and process the information that we collect in the United Kingdom in accordance with this privacy policy.\nAll data is processed fairly and lawfully in accordance with UK and EU law and the principles and requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (\"the GDPR\").</p> Our legal basis for processing information\n<p>We only process personal data for lawful purposes as described in Article 6 of the GDPR.\nFor all of the main functionality of our services our legal basis is that you've given us consent to access this information in order to provide a particular service related to your Twitter account.</p>\n<p>Generally, the remainder of the processing of personal data we perform is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests.\nFor example, the information stored by us in web server logs is necessary for us to monitor the security and stability of our websites.</p> Right of access\n<p>You have a right to view any data associated with you that we hold.\nPlease visit this page when signed in to our service and you'll see a button here allowing you to view all stored data related to your account.</p> Right to erasure\n<p>You have a right to request the erasure of any data associated with you that we hold.\nPlease visit this page when signed in to our service and you'll see a button here allowing you to remove your TweetDelete account and all associated data.</p> Contacting us\n<p>For any matters related to data protection, you can contact us via email to support@tweetdelete.net or write to TD Social LLC, 2261 Market Street #4811, San Francisco, California 94114, United States.\nFor any specific data access/deletion requests, please include your Twitter account name.</p>\n<p>If we've missed anything or if you have any questions or concerns, please get in touch.\nWe're a small company, but we take user privacy very seriously.</p>\n<ul>\n<li> FAQ </li>\n<li> Terms of service &amp.\nPrivacy </li>\n<li> Contact </li>\n<li>
