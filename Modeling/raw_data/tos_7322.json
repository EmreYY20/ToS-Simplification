clear and easy to read as possible, so don't expect pages of legalese!</p>\nForbidden activities\n<p>is.gd may <b>NOT</b> be used creating shortened URLs that: -</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are used in commercial email</li>\n<li>Are used for unsolicited advertising (spam) including email, forum posts, SMS messages and spam posts/messaging on social networks such as Facebook or Twitter</li>\n<li>Link to malicious content (phishing, viruses, trojans, adware, any other malware)</li>\n<li>Link to any form of child pornography</li>\n<li>Link to other URL shortening or redirection sites or scripts (these \"chains\" of links are often used to hide malicious usage)</li>\n<li>Link to material that infringes copyright</li>\n<li>Link to material we consider unethical including but not limited to \"get rich quick\" schemes, pyramid schemes, paid \"self help\" schemes, dubious competitions, sites requiring users to fill out paid surveys and sites with a model that encourges users to spam others (e.g.\n\"Sign up 10 members to get X free\")</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition any use of is.gd and any content linked to must be legal in the UK (where is.gd is hosted).</p>\nURL rejection and removal\n<p>We can reject URLs when they are submitted or later remove, disable or redirect shortened URLs for any reason.\nOur intention is only to do this where they violate our terms or the spirit of fair usage, or we have reason to suspect they do (e.g.\nif they appear on a blacklist we consult).\nWe're only human and mistakes are occasionally made - we can reinstate disabled shortened URLs if we think it's appropriate to do so.</p>\nExcessive usage\n<p>We need to keep is.gd fast and responsive for everyone so we limit the amount it can be used to levels we consider reasonable.\nSee our usage limits page for the current limits.\nUsers may not open more than 5 concurrent connections to is.gd at any time.\nFor automated scripts or programs using our API a specific code is returned for excessive use (see our developer documentation) and your application should wait before retrying your request.\nIf it doesn't do this and continues to hammer you may get blocked.</p>\nOur shortened URLs\n<p>Users who create is.gd shortened URLs cannot later delete them or modify their destinations (this helps to prevent abuse).\nOur shortened URLs could redirect anywhere, you follow them at your own risk and is.gd is not responsible or liable for content you visit.</p>\nData usage\n<p>We do not share any information with third parties unless explicitly stated in our privacy policy.\nWe do not collect or store any information other that required to provide you with the service and to provide us with site usage statistics.</p>\nWarranty and liability\n<p>The short version: is.gd is free.\nWe'll do our best to maintain it but we might have problems or things might break.\nIf they do, we don't owe you anything.</p>\n<p>The long version: we provide is.gd as a free service - as such it carries no warranty of any kind.\nis.gd and its staff and owners are not liable for any loss or problem you might suffer due to using the service.\nThis includes losses in the event that the service stops operating, is unavailable or slow, suffers data loss, or any other issue which might be considered detrimental to you.</p>\nViolation of our terms\n<p>If you violate our terms, depending on the severity of the abuse, we may disable shortened URLs you have created or block you from using is.gd (and our other URL shorteners) temporarily or permanently.\nIn cases of severe abuse or illegal usage we may report this to the relevant law enforcement agencies.</p>\n<p>\nTerms &amp.\nConditions | Privacy Policy | Spam Policy | Report Abuse<br>\n\u00a9is.gd 2023\n</p> ", "created_at":

content.\nWe take this abuse of our service very seriously and do everything we can to prevent it.\nHere are some of the ways we help to keep our users safe: -</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shortened URLs are permanent - we don't allow users to change their destinations once they've been created.\nThis prevents \"bait and switch\" tactics by spammers who might link to real content first and then malware later.</li>\n<li>We check all our links against various blacklists such as SURBL.\nWe update these lists regularly and our technology applies these updates across our entire database of links immediately.</li>\n<li>When we flag a link as spam, we add a very prominent warning page so that visitors know it is likely to be malicious.\nTo help those fighting spam we still show the original destination, but users can no longer visit it without manually copying/pasting the full link into their browser.</li>\n<li>We thoroughly investigate any complaints of abuse we receive and have a dedicated contact email address for these.\nWe aim to act on all abuse complaints within 24 hours (but typically manage better than this).</li>\n<li>We don't just disable individual URLs in response to complaints like some similar services.\nSince a spammer could create many similar links this would obviously be useless.\nWe blacklist by domain or track down links based on the creator's IP instead whenever possible.</li>\n<li>Our terms are very clear on what usage isn't allowed.\nBecause we disallow use in any commercial email (whether or not it's technically unsolicited spam), there isn't any scope for spammers to skirt around our policies.</li>\n<li>We blacklist other URL shortening/redirection services we know about.\nThis stops spammers creating \"chains\" of redirects to help them circumvent our protections.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We hate spam usage of our service and is.gd has no relationship with spammers.\nWe never send any spam email and only ever email people who have emailed us first (e.g.\nto respond to questions we get about the site).</p>\n<p>\nTerms &amp.\nConditions | Privacy Policy | Spam Policy | Report Abuse<br>\n\u00a9is.gd 2023\n</p> ", "created_at":
