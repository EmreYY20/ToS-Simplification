SERVICES PRIVACY POLICY <p>&nbsp;<br>\n<strong>Effective Date</strong>\n<br>\nDecember 23, 2022<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nThis Privacy Policy describes how Simplifi Holdings, Inc.\n<strong>(\u201cSimplifi,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d)</strong> collects, receives, uses, retains, processes, discloses, transfers, and secures Personal Information through our suite of advertising services <strong>(\u201cAdvertising Services\u201d)</strong>.\nIt also describes your choices regarding use, access, deletion, and correction of your Personal Information.\nOur clients, including advertisers or publishers, are referred to in this Policy as \u201cAdvertising Customers.\u201d All references to \u201cyou,\u201d \u201cyour\u201d or \u201cuser\u201d apply to consumers whose Personal Information we collect for our Advertising Services.\nFor information about our data practices on our website located at http://simpli.fi, or our online client portal located at https://app.simpli.fi/login, please review our Website Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\u201cPersonal Information\u201d in this Privacy Policy is information about you that is personally identifying or could reasonably be used to identify you, such as your name, email address, or telephone number.\nThe definition of Personal Information depends on the laws that apply in your location and may include other types of information as well, such as location data (including precise geo- location data), your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your mobile advertising identifier, or another unique identifier.\nThis Privacy Policy covers information we collect online only, unless local law requires otherwise.</p>\n1.\nCHANGES TO THIS POLICY\n<p>This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically for any changes.\nIf we make any material changes, we will notify you by means of a notice on our website prior to the change becoming effective.</p>\n2.\nINFORMATION WE COLLECT\n<p>Simplifi provides its online Advertising Services to Advertising Customers through site retargeting, search retargeting, contextual retargeting, Facebook API, and location-based services including geolocation of Internet users (\u201c<strong>GeoFencing</strong>\u201d).\nThese services are generally provided through third-party websites owned and/or operated by our Advertising Customers who publish their own content on the Internet.</p>\n<p>We may receive Personal Information such as physical addresses from our Advertising Customers, which we de-identify and use for GeoFencing and to provide analytical reports to our Advertising Customers.\nWe may also obtain information from third-party data providers, such as physical addresses and information about consumer characteristics such as demographics and predicted interests.</p>\n<p>Through our Advertising Services, we collect information about users\u2019 online activities over time and across non-affiliated web sites, mobile applications, or online services, as applicable, and across multiple devices including connected TVs.\nWe collect information about your device and your visit(s) to websites, apps, and online services, such as browser type and version, Internet service provider (ISP), mobile operating system, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, responses by a web visitor to an advertisement delivered by us or a third party, and/or clickstream data.</p>\n<p>We also collect information that identifies your devices, which may be considered Personal Information.\nThis information can include, for example, IP addresses, mobile advertising identifiers, and cookie identifiers.\nSimplifi collects Precise Location Data (as defined by the NAI) for your device when, for example, a user makes such information available through a third-party mobile application or webpage on a particular device.\nSimplifi may receive this Precise Location Data from third-party partners including Cuebiq.\nSimplifi also engages in cross-device linking.</p>\n<p>We may combine all of the information that we collect to provide our Advertising Services.</p>\n3.\nHOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION\n<p>We use cookies, JavaScript, and similar technologies to provide our Advertising Services.\nAmong these technologies, we employ a software technology called clear gifs (or web beacons), that help us better manage the advertising content on our network of third-party sites.\nClear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online activities of Web users.\nIn contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user\u2019s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.\nIn compliance with the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Code of Conduct, we do not tie the device identifying information gathered by clear gifs to personally identifiable information except as permitted by the NAI Code.</p>\n<p>In performing our Advertising Services, we collect information in multiple ways, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>on our own websites</li>\n<li>on the websites of publishers or Advertising Customers,</li>\n<li>when we serve online advertisements, and</li>\n<li>from third party providers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The collection of this data about your online activities across non-affiliated properties and linked devices allows us and our Advertising Customers to better target advertising to user interests.\nThis process is called interest-based advertising.\nThe Advertising Services include various analytics and measurement services as well.\nThe data also allows us to improve our services, for example, improving the effectiveness of the advertisements delivered to users and limiting the number of times a person sees a given advertisement.</p>\n4.\nINFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE\n<p>We may share the information we collect with other parties for our business reasons, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We share your Personal Information with our affiliates and third-party vendors who provide services on our behalf.</li>\n<li>We can disclose Personal Information to provide our Advertising Services, including disclosures to our Advertising Customers to enable them to serve interest-based advertisements to user devices based on the user\u2019s browsing history and online activities.</li>\n<li>Simplifi may also disclose any information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with legal process served on Simplifi, (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Simplifi.\n(3) protect the personal safety of users of Simplifi, its Advertising Services, or other services.\n(4) provide updates and services that may be of interest to the user.\nor (5) prevent online fraud or other cyber threats, for example through an online threat exchange, or to report, detect and/or prevent security events.</li>\n<li>Simplifi is required to disclose Personal Information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.\n</li>\n<li>Simplifi may disclose Personal Information with notice or with your consent, where permitted by law.</li>\n</ul>\n5.\nSALE OF ASSETS\n<p>In the event that Simplifi is involved in a potential or actual merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, including in bankruptcy, we reserve the right to include, disclose and transfer any or all stored Personal Information and other data among the assets transferred to the acquiring company.\nIf this occurs, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or material changes in uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.</p>\n6.\nHEALTH TARGETING\n<p>We partner with third parties to provide customers with targeting options related to health and wellness interests.\nIf you would like to view the current list of third-party health and wellness interest segments available through Simplifi, please click here.</p>\n7.\nPOLITICAL TARGETING\n<p>We partner with third parties to provide customers with political targeting options.\nIf you would like to view the current list of third-party political interest segments available through Simplifi, please click here.</p>\n8.\nYOUR CHOICES\n<p>\n<strong>Opting Out of Simplifi Targeted Advertising on Your Browser</strong>\n<br>\nSimpli.fi engages in interest-based advertising activities, including cross-device linking, as described above.\nIf you would like to stop receiving interest-based advertising from Simplifi on your browser, click here.\nBy doing so, Simplifi will replace your unique cookie with an \u201copt-out\u201d flag that will prevent us from serving you interest-based advertising.\nAn opt-out choice means that we no longer use or transfer data from the opted-out device for targeted advertisements, and we no longer use data collected on other devices to inform advertisements on that device.\nWe will still collect and store information through such cookies for other purposes such as metrics and analytics and we may still serve you advertising, but it will not be tailored for you.\nBecause cookies are browser specific, if you use more than one browser or device, you will need to make your opt-out choice on each browser or device that you use.\nTo do so, point each browser that you use to this page, and click on the opt-out link above.\nPlease note that you will need to set the Simplifi opt-out cookie again in some cases, for example, under the following circumstances: you buy a new computer or device, delete cookies from your browser, or upgrade or change the browser of your existing computer or device.</p>\n<p>Simplifi is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adheres to the NAI Code of Conduct.\nAdditional information on the NAI and its code can be viewed at http://www.networkadvertising.org/code-enforcement/code.</p>\n<p>Simplifi also licenses the AdChoices icon from the Digital Advertising Alliance (\u201cDAA\u201d) at http://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/ and the DAAC at http://youradchoices.ca for the purpose of providing enhanced notice and to inform users when they are being behaviorally targeted and to provide an opportunity to opt out.</p>\n<p>Simplifi makes every effort to ensure adherence to the self-regulatory principles of the DAA and the DAAC.<br>\nTo opt-out of interest-based advertising by other companies participating in the following consumer choice mechanisms, please visit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)\u2019s self-regulatory opt-out page (http://optout.aboutads.info/) and mobile application-based \u201cAppChoices\u201d download page (https://youradchoices.com/appchoices)\n</li>\n<li>European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA)\u2019s consumer opt-out

(https://www.networkadvertising.org/internet-connected-tv-choices/)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>DO NOT TRACK</strong>\n<br>\nWe currently honor Do Not Track signals transmitted by browsers by treating this signal as an opt out of interest-based advertising.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>OPTING OUT FROM SIMPLIFI\u2019S LOCATION-BASED ADVERTISING</strong>\n<br>\nYou may opt out of our collection, use, and transfer of precise location data for location-based advertising purposes, by using the location services controls in your mobile device\u2019s settings.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>ACCESSING YOUR INFORMATION</strong>\n<br>\nYou may request to access your Personal Information that we hold, as well as to correct, amend or delete information when it is inaccurate, or has been processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles or when otherwise required by law.\nTo make such requests, please contact us at privacy@simpli.fi.\nWe will respond to these requests in accordance with the laws that apply to you and within a reasonable timeframe.\nYou can help us maintain the accuracy of your information by notifying us of any changes to your information.\nWe may deny a request in some cases when permitted by law, such as when the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual\u2019s privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.</p>\n9.\nINTERNATIONAL OR CROSS-BORDER TRANSFER OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION\n<p>By providing Personal Information and/or by communicating with us by email, you acknowledge and expressly consent to our processing and disclosure of your Personal Information outside your country.\nThe Personal Information of users who are located outside the U.S.\nmay be transferred to the U.S., where our servers are located and where it will be processed and stored on servers in the U.S.\nIndividuals from the European Union, United Kingdom, and Switzerland, please see the section below on \u201cCross-Border Transfers from Europe\u201d for more information.</p>\n10.\nEU DATA SUBJECTS: PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION\n<p>We process Personal Information with your consent.\nOn other occasions, we may process Personal Information when we need to do so to fulfill a contract (for example, for billing purposes) or where required to do this by law.\nIf necessary, we may also process Personal Information when it is in our legitimate interests to do this (e.g., for auditing purposes or for fraud detection) and when these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights.</p>\n<p>EU data subjects may have rights to access, portability, to revoke consent, to correct, delete, and/or object to or restrict processing of the Personal Information you provide to us.\nYou can email a request to us at privacy@simpli.fi.\nWe will respond to your request in a reasonable timeframe and in accordance with the law that applies to you.\nSometimes a request in relation to your Personal Information may not apply to certain information, such as information we may keep to comply with legal requirements.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you have the right to lodge a complaint against us.\nTo do so, contact the supervisory authority in your country of residence.</p>\n11.\nCROSS-BORDER TRANSFERS FROM EUROPE\n<p>Simplifi relies on safeguards such as the SCCs to receive Personal Information from the European Union, United Kingdom and Switzerland.\nSimplifi also continues to participate in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework.\nSimplifi is committed to subjecting all Personal Information received from European Union (EU) member countries, the United Kingdom and Switzerland, respectively, in reliance on each Privacy Shield Framework, to that Framework\u2019s applicable Principles.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield Frameworks, and
