TERMS USED BELOW THAT ARE CAPITALIZED BUT AREN\u2019T IMMEDIATELY DEFINED.\nTHOSE TERMS HAVE THE MEANINGS GIVEN TO THEM IN EXHIBIT A.\n</p>\n<p> IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT A PAYMENT, INCLUDING SCHEDULING A PAYMENT, CANCELLING A SCHEDULED PAYMENT, OR DISPUTING A PAYMENT, PLEASE READ AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS IN EXHIBIT B BELOW.\n</p>\n<p> IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE USE OF BANKS OR SINGLE-USE VIRTUAL CREDIT CARDS IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE, PLEASE READ SECTIONS 2-4 AND EXHIBIT B BELOW.\n</p> 1.\nAcceptance.\nModifications <p> You accept this Agreement by signing up for the App after being presented with a link to this Agreement, or by clicking <b>\u201cAGREE\u201d</b> or another acceptance button, or by otherwise showing you assent to the terms of this Agreement.\nBillGO may modify this Agreement following notice to you.\nBillGO\u2019s notice may be provided via in-App messaging or email to your email address on file with BillGO.\nBillGO will also post any modified terms on its Website.\nBy agreeing to the modified Agreement or by using the Service after you receive notice that the Agreement has been modified, you agree to the terms of the modified Agreement.\nIF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY MODIFIED AGREEMENT, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED OR LICENSED TO USE THE SERVICE.\n</p> 2.\nDescription of the Service 2.1.\nWhat the Service Does <p> You may use the Service to link your bank, credit card, and bill payment accounts, review and track your bills, and facilitate your bill payments to Billers in the amounts and on the days you request (the <b>\u201cPurpose\u201d</b>).\nThe Service then facilitates your bill payments by providing your payment instructions (including applicable Bill Pay Data) to a Biller, who then processes your payment.\nA payment may be made through your method of choice, which may (where available) include BillGO\u2019s use of a single-use virtual credit card, in which case BillGO will: (A) make a payment on your behalf pursuant to your instructions while using a single-use virtual credit card.\nand (B) provide your applicable Bill Pay Data to a Bank (as defined below) that will debit the amount of the bill payment from your financial institution (the <b>\u201cSingle Use Card Process\u201d</b>).\n</p> 2.2.\nSINGLE USE CARD PROCESS <p> WHEN USING THE SINGLE USE CARD PROCESS, YOUR PERSONAL PAYMENT ACCOUNT INFORMATION (INCLUDING YOUR NAME) IS <b>\n<u>NOT</u>\n</b> EXPOSED, WHICH CAN REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR FRAUD AND MISUSE OF YOUR PAYMENT ACCOUNT INFORMATION.\nMOREOVER, BILLGO\u2019S USE OF A SINGLE USE VIRTUAL CREDIT CARD DOES NOT IMPACT YOUR CREDIT SCORE.\nHOWEVER, WHEN A SINGLE USE VIRTUAL CREDIT CARD IS USED TO MAKE YOUR PAYMENT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BILLGO MAY EARN INTERCHANGE FEES AS PART OF THE TRANSACTION.\nYOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, ALTHOUGH BILLGO MAY INITIATE THE SINGLE USE CARD PROCESS BASED ON YOUR DIRECTION AND CHOICES MADE WITHIN YOUR USER PROFILE, THE DECISION OF WHETHER TO USE SUCH PROCESS IS AT BILLGO\u2019S SOLE DISCRETION.\n</p> 2.3.\nWhat the Service Doesn\u2019t Do <p> The Service is limited to the Purpose.\nBillGO and the Service do not: (A) take possession of your payment funds.\n(B) transmit or transfer funds or provide deposit account or other financial services.\n(C) set the terms of any payment transaction between you and Billers.\n(D) endorse or have any liability for transactions between you and Billers.\nor (E) control or have any liability for returns, refunds, chargebacks, or other questions or disputes you may have with any Biller related to any payment transaction.\n</p> 2.4.\nBank Transmission <p> The Service is operated by BillGO in conjunction with SouthState Bank, N.A., a national bank, and MVB Bank, a West Virginia state-chartered bank, both Member FDIC (each, a <b>\u201cBank\u201d</b> and together the <b>\u201cBanks\u201d</b>).\nThe Banks only have the limited responsibility set forth in Section 2.1 above, are not parties to this Agreement, and have no other responsibilities under this Agreement.\nThis Agreement does not modify any separate written agreement you may have with any Bank or Biller.\n</p> 2.5.\nSupplemental Bill Pay Terms <p> Additional terms and conditions relating to the bill payment process are set forth in Exhibit B to this Agreement.\nIn the event of a conflict between the terms in the body of this Agreement and the terms in Exhibit B, the terms in Exhibit B will control but solely to the extent of the conflict.\n</p> 2.6.\nAccuracy <p> It is your responsibility to ensure that all of the payment details are accurate and complete before you initiate a bill payment.\nFailure to provide accurate and complete information may result in errors in your requested payments to Billers, and you may not be able to recover a payment sent to an incorrect account or recipient.\n</p> 2.6.\nLimitations <p> The Service does not support payments to all types of Billers.\nFor example, you may not initiate payments to Billers outside of the U.S., or to certain government agencies for certain types of payments (e.g., tax payments or certain court-ordered payments).\nIn addition, when you send a payment using the Service, a Biller is not obligated or required to accept it.\nYou acknowledge that Billers may not accept payment from all types of funding sources and that BillGO may otherwise limit the payment methods available for a particular Biller.\nBillGO may refuse to permit payment to a Biller if it reasonably believes such refusal is necessary or advisable for legal or security reasons.\nIf you fail to maintain a balance in the applicable Payment Account that is sufficient to fund any payment that you initiate, the transaction may not be completed, and BillGO will have no liability for such incomplete transaction.\nFinally, your Payment Accounts must be held with U.S.\nfinancial institutions.\n</p> 3.\nAuthorization and Account Information 3.1.\nBiller Account Information <p> By using the Service, you authorize BillGO to access your Biller Account, including via the Biller\u2019s website, on your behalf and as your limited agent, in order to provide the Service.\nIn the event a Biller employs the use of a \u201cCAPTCHA\u201d or similar technology on its website during the login process, you further authorize the Service (or any third-party technology therein) to decode such \u201cCAPTCHA\u201d or similar technology as your limited agent on your behalf.\nAfter linking or adding a Biller Account through the Service, the Service will submit information, including usernames and passwords that you provide, to log into the Biller\u2019s website.\nYou authorize BillGO as your limited agent to use and store information associated with your Biller Account in order to provide the Service, including by ensuring the Service is compatible with the applicable Biller website.\n</p> 3.2.\nPayment Account Information <p> By initiating a bill payment through the Service, you authorize BillGO and the Service to act as your limited agent to perform the actions described in Section 2.1 above and this Section 3.2, including accessing your applicable Bill Pay Data and transmitting that data to Banks and Billers.\nIf BillGO uses a single-use virtual credit card to make a payment on your behalf, you specifically authorize: (A) BillGO to pay your bill using a single-use virtual credit card.\nand (B) a Bank to initiate a debit from your applicable Payment Account in the amount of your bill payment.\nYou are solely responsible for complying with any terms set by your bank, credit union, or financial institution with respect to your Payment Account, including any terms relating to transaction limitations or fees, such as those pertaining to non-sufficient funds or overdrafts.\nIf you are entitled to a reversal, refund, or other adjustment associated with a payment you made using the Service, you also authorize the crediting of your Payment Account to complete that transaction.\n</p> 3.3.\nPayment Account Information <p>\n<b>AN IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT BILLERS AND THEIR IP.</b> THE APP PROVIDES EASY WAYS FOR YOU TO IDENTIFY YOUR BILLERS.\n<b> HOWEVER, ALL REFERENCES TO THIRD PARTIES (I.E., ANY PARTY OTHER THAN YOU AND BILLGO) ARE FOR IDENTIFICATION PURPOSES ONLY AND DO NOT IMPLY ANY ENDORSEMENT OR SPONSORSHIP OF, OR ANY AFFILIATION WITH, THE APP OR BILLGO.\n</b> ALL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY NOT OWNED BY BILLGO

ENDORSEMENT, SPONSORSHIP OR AFFILIATION.\n</p> 4.\nPrivacy and Personal Information 4.1.\nPrivacy Policy <p> Your use of the Service is subject to BillGO\u2019s Privacy Policy, which is located at

Action or any Dispute where you timely provide BillGO with a valid Arbitration Opt-out Notice are the state and federal courts located in the City and County of Denver, Colorado, and you and BillGO

WHICH YOU OR BILLGO ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.\nNO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE JOINED, CONSOLIDATED, OR COMBINED WITH ANOTHER ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WITHOUT THE

P.O.\nBox 272390, Fort Collins, Colorado, 80527, and in each instance must be titled: NOTICE OF DISPUTE UNDER PRISM TERMS OF SERVICE.\nThe Notice of Dispute must include both your email address and

address it has on file for you.\nA Notice of Dispute must: (A) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (B) set forth the specific amount of damages or other relief sought (<b>\u201cDemand\u201d</b>).\n</p> 18.5.\nProceedings <p> If you and BillGO do not reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within 30 days after the Notice of Dispute is received, you or BillGO may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nAny arbitration must be governed and administered by the American Arbitration Association (the <b>\u201cAAA\u201d</b>) in accordance with the AAA\u2019s \u201cConsumer Arbitration Rules\u201d effective September 1, 2014, including the \u201cCosts of Arbitration (Including AAA Administrative Fees)\u201d effective September 1, 2014 (collectively, the <b>\u201cConsumer Procedures\u201d</b>), except that this Agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with the Consumer Procedures.\nALL ISSUES IN THE DISPUTE ARE SUBJECT TO THE REVIEW OF A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR.\nIn ruling on a Dispute, the neutral arbitrator will apply the terms of this Agreement and the laws of the State of Colorado.\nThe arbitrator has discretionary authority to conduct the arbitration via conference call or face-to-face hearing.\nThe arbitrator will render an award within the time specified in the Consumer Procedures.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.\nJudgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\nBillGO and you agree that the

liable.\nYou may download or copy the AAA\u2019s forms and rules from https://www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nUnless you and BillGO otherwise agree in writing, the arbitration must be conducted in the City and County of Denver, Colorado.\nIf your Demand does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and BillGO submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.\nIf your Demand exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the Consumer Procedures.\nSubject to the Consumer Procedures, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.\n</p> 18.6.\nAAA Not Integral to Agreement to Arbitrate <p> You and BillGO agree that the use of the AAA to administer arbitration is not integral to the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate Disputes.\nIf the AAA will not or cannot conduct an arbitration, you and BillGO will negotiate in good faith to agree on a sole arbitrator who will resolve the Dispute as provided in the Consumer Procedures.\nIf the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, either party may request a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator, who will follow the Consumer Procedures.\n</p> 18.7.\nSeverability <p> If one or more parts of this Section 18 are found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a Dispute, then, and only in that circumstance, those parts will be severed and the Dispute will be resolved subject to all remaining parts of Section 18.\nIf such severance results in all or some parts of a Dispute proceeding in a court of law, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any such court proceeding will be the state or federal courts sitting in the city and county of Denver, Colorado.\nFor purposes of any such court proceeding, you consent to, and will not challenge, such courts\u2019 personal jurisdiction over you, and you further waive objection based upon improper venue or forum non conveniens and will not seek transfer to another district or jurisdiction.\n</p> 18.8.\nFAA <p> The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of all provisions of this Agreement relating to arbitration.\n</p> 19.\nNotice

Date\u201d</b>).\nIf you choose \u201cToday\u201d, the payment will be scheduled to be processed on the same Business Day, except that you must schedule the payment before the Biller\u2019s designated cut-off time on a day that the Biller accepts payments in order for the payment to be received on the same Business Day.\nA payment that is scheduled for \u201cToday\u201d but submitted after the processing cut-off time (or on a day that is not a day the Biller accepts payments) will be paid on the next day the Biller accepts payments.\nActual processing times vary by Biller.\nBiller deadlines may be shown in the App.\nIf you schedule a payment on a weekend or holiday, your payment may not be processed until the next Business Day.\nBillGO is not obligated to provide you with any notice of delay in processing your payment to the Biller or of the completion or rejection of your payment to the Biller.\nYou are solely responsible for contacting the designated Biller if you want to confirm receipt of your payment by the designated Biller on the same Business Day.\nBILLGO MAKES NO GUARANTEE THAT A BILLER WILL RECEIVE THE PAYMENT, OR POST A PAYMENT TO YOUR ACCOUNT, ON THE SAME BUSINESS

a specific Biller each month for a particular bill payment.\nAs applicable, you also authorize BillGO to electronically debit and credit your designated payment method to correct erroneous debits and

in Lending Act (for credit accounts and lines).\nWhen BillGO receives notification from you, it will suspend your account.\nAn \u201cUnauthorized Electronic Funds Transfer\u201d is an electronic funds transfer initiated by a person other than you who does not have actual, implied, or apparent authority to initiate the transfer, and from which you do not benefit.\nIf you give access to your account

the aggregate dollar amount of transactions allowed over a period of time, or the maximum number of payments allowed over a period of time.\nThe App will identify applicable limits and relevant time periods.\nA period of time may be measured as a calendar day, a rolling 30-day period, or otherwise.\nBillGO also reserves the right to decline to process any payment that appears illegal or in breach of this Agreement and to notify relevant authorities.\n</p> 8.\nCollection of Returned Item Fees <p> If your payment is returned unpaid, you authorize BillGO at its sole discretion to instruct a Bank
