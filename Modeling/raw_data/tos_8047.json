circumstances (as outlined in this process) requests to change user information including changes to direct debits, standing orders or any other kind of donation, can only be authorized by the user.&nbsp;We can only take instructions from a third party with the express consent of the user or on evidence of the relevant power of attorney.\nThis is to safeguard the interests of the user with whom we have a relationship.</p>\n<p>A request by a third party to remove a user from our mailing list or change mailing preferences may be considered exceptionally if we are convinced the third party is acting in the best interests of the user.\nThis may be a judgment based on the user\u2019s history of giving, any unusual changes in the level of their giving or frequency of giving and any communication we have had with the user regarding their gifts or mailing preferences.\nAny direct communication from the user (verbal or written)&nbsp;which gives concern that the user may lack capacity to make a sound decision and/or judgment could be taken as support on this.\nIn this context our telemarketing agencies who call on our behalf in fundraising campaigns record conversations with prospective users and where there is a concern relating to mental capacity these recordings could be used by Operation Smile for final decision making.&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>IS MY INFORMATION

Conduct cannot envision every issue that might arise in Operation Smile\u2019s daily activities.\nRather, it serves to document Operation Smile\u2019s commitment to professional, ethical and legal conduct.\nWhen Constituents act consistently within the Code of Conduct, we build trust, strengthen community relationships and preserve our superior reputation as a leading international surgical

RELIGION</strong>\n<p>Operation Smile is a non-governmental organization (NGO) with no affiliation to politics or religion.&nbsp;All bodies acting under the brand of Operation Smile should clearly state the absence of the organization\u2019s affiliation to politics or religion under all circumstances.</p>\n<strong>B.\nHUMAN RESOURCES</strong>\n<strong>1.\nNO DISCRIMINATION OR HARASSMENT</strong>\n<p>Operation Smile does not discriminate against, nor tolerate harassment or bullying of any of, its Constituents based on race, color, creed, religion, sex, age, disability, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, armed forces service, marital or veteran status, sexual orientation, gender orientation, political opinions, or any other impermissible factor.\nConcerns related to discrimination, harassment or bullying should be reported as soon as possible and will be addressed.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<strong>2.\nHUMAN CAPITAL</strong>\n<p>Operation Smile strives to protect and nurture its employees and volunteers by:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2.1 Treating all employees and volunteers with respect and compassion.</p>\n<p>2.2 Having and implementing written Human

environments.</p>\n<p>3.2&nbsp;Operation Smile strives to provide affordable health and welfare benefits for employees.</p>\n<p>3.3&nbsp;Employees are encouraged to take time off as rest and

whom it works.\nIndividual actions of each Constituent should always be considered as they reflect on the Operation Smile brand, whether positively or negatively.</p>\n<p>To maintain a strong culture of integrity, respect and quality when engaging in Operation Smile activities or traveling in connection with Operation Smile activities, Operation Smile asks its Constituents to support Operation

any type of elective surgery or other non-emergency procedures performed during an Operation Smile program.</p>\n<strong>C.\nCHILD PROTECTION, PATIENT RIGHTS, NO EXPLOITATION</strong>\n<strong>1.\nCHILD PROTECTION</strong>\n<p>Operation Smile shall, at all times, show due respect for the rights of all children and the Articles of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC).\nThe standards set forth are the minimum acceptable standards and Constituents are expected to meet or exceed these standards when applying them to a local context.\nWe define a child as being anyone who is under the age of 18, even if age of majority is attained earlier under local law.</p>\n<p>Operation Smile\u2019s conduct must reflect its fundamental belief that all children:</p>\n<p>1.1 Are deserving of its support, care and protection.</p>\n<p>1.2 Have equal rights to protection from physical and mental abuse, and exploitation, including sexual exploitation.</p>\n<p>1.3 Have a fundamental right to life, survival and development.</p>\n<p>1.4 Should enjoy a full and decent life and are deserving of the opportunity to fully and actively participate in their community.</p>\n<p>1.5&nbsp;Should be given the right to express their views freely and have those views given \u2018due weight.\u2019</p>\n<p>1.6&nbsp;&nbsp;Will be treated with respect regardless of gender, nationality or ethnic origin, religious or political beliefs, age, physical or mental health, sexual preference, gender identity, family, socioeconomic or cultural background, or any history of conflict with the law.</p>\n<p>1.7 &nbsp;Who come into contact with Operation Smile should be better off because of the experience.\nOther than the inherent risk of undergoing any medical care, no child must come to harm as a result of their engagement with Operation Smile.&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>2.\nPATIENT RIGHTS</strong>\n<p>Operation Smile\u2019s patients and their families:</p>\n<p>2.1 Are deserving of respect, dignity, quality care and realistic expectations regarding what Operation Smile can and cannot accomplish.</p>\n<p>2.2 Should be well informed and involved in decisions regarding their care.\ntreatment should only be provided after the proper informed consent has been obtained from the patient (if of legal age) or from the patient\u2019s guardian (if the patient is a minor).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2.3 Are entitled to their privacy and the protection of their health information.\ntherefore, health information or other confidential information is only to be shared with those involved in providing medical treatment or maintenance of medical records, unless the patient/guardian consents to the sharing of such information or the disclosure is required by law.</p>\n<p>2.4 Have the right to control the use of their images, video recordings and audio recordings.\nConstituents taking photographs or videos must:</p>\n<p>2.4.1&nbsp.\nObtain informed documented consent from the patient, parent or guardian before photographing or filming and explain how the materials will be used.</p>\n<p>2.1.2&nbsp;Ensure

prevents sexual exploitation and abuse.\n&nbsp;Operation Smile will take immediate action to protect those who it believes are being exploited and will cooperate with law enforcement.\nOperation Smile will take disciplinary action up to and including severing all ties with the accused.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3.1 Sexual exploitation and abuse by any Constituent will be considered an act of gross misconduct and be grounds for termination of the relationship and will also result in reporting to law enforcement as required or (if not required) as appropriate.</p>\n<p>3.2 Sexual activity with children (persons under the age of 18) is prohibited regardless of the local age of majority or age of consent.\nMistaken belief in the age of a child is not a defense.</p>\n<p>3.3 Exchange of money, employment, goods or services for sex, including sexual favors or other forms of humiliating, degrading or exploitative behavior, is prohibited.</p>\n<p>3.4 Sexual relationships with any beneficiaries (patients or one of their family members) are prohibited.\nSuch relationships undermine the credibility and integrity of humanitarian aid work.</p>\n<p>3.5 Constituents with concerns regarding sexual abuse or exploitation should report such concerns as soon as possible via Operation Smile\u2019s established reporting channels.</p>\n<strong>D.&nbsp.\nMEDICAL QUALITY</strong>\n<strong>1.&nbsp.\n&nbsp;GLOBAL STANDARDS OF CARE</strong>\n<p>Operation Smile\u2019s Global Standards of Care will be followed in all medical and programmatic activities.\nAll

standards.</p>\n<p>https://www.operationsmile.org/standardsofcare</p>\n<strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nFITNESS FOR SERVICE&nbsp;</strong>\n<p>2.1&nbsp;Medical volunteers are expected to maintain the high-quality standards demanded by the licensure requirements of their home country, as well as to honor any requirements set out by the host country when securing temporary medical licensure.\nMedical volunteers whose licensure has been suspended or terminated must be fully reinstated before being eligible to participate as a medical volunteer.</p>\n<p>2.2&nbsp;Medical volunteers may only perform services they have been licensed and chosen to perform.\nTraining and education of medical volunteers beyond the realm of observation learning must be conducted as part of sanctioned, structured and properly supervised Operation Smile Programs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2.3 No one engaged in the provision of any kind of medical care will do so under the influence of alcohol or illicit drugs.\nThe same is true if it relates to legally prescribed pharmaceuticals taken in excess or where there is a noticeable impairment.\nThe safety of Operation Smile\u2019s patients must always come first.</p>\n<strong>3.\nSUPPLY CHAIN INTEGRITY&nbsp;</strong>\n<p>The safety and well-being of Operation Smile patients is dependent upon its ability to source and utilize medical supplies, equipment and pharmaceuticals sourced from reputable manufacturers and suppliers.\nAnyone purchasing on behalf of Operation Smile is expected to source supplies, particularly pharmaceuticals, from reputable manufacturers and suppliers who can demonstrate their procurement and safety protocols, as well as the pedigree of any items procured or utilized.\nAll local suppliers should be reported to Operation Smile, and changes in suppliers should be reported via established reporting channels.\nSuppliers must be willing to allow facility tours or other inspection techniques upon request.</p>\n<strong>E.\nFINANCIAL MANAGEMENT&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>1.\nZERO TOLERANCE OF FRAUD, MONEY LAUNDERING AND CORRUPTION</strong>\n<p>Operation Smile will not tolerate fraudulent activity, money laundering or corruption, which are defined as illegal or deceptive behaviors conducted for purposes of inappropriate financial or other benefit.\nNeither fraud nor corruption are restricted to monetary or material benefit but could also include the gaining of intangible benefits such as increased status or beneficial information.\nAny suspicion of fraud, money laundering, corruption or other improper gain will be investigated, and legal action will be taken if necessary.</p>\n<p>Operation Smile expects Constituents to honor its financial policies, which include:</p>\n<p>1.1&nbsp.\nAnti-corruption policies and policies prohibiting bribes, money laundering and fraud.</p>\n<p>1.2&nbsp.\nInternal processes and control systems to prevent, detect and take action against potential fraud and corruption.</p>\n<p>1.3&nbsp.\nDealing fairly and without favoritism with patients, partners, suppliers, competitors and independent auditors, and refraining from

making any improper payments (i.e.\nbribes, kickbacks or other payments for illegal purposes) to government or non-governmental officials, suppliers, or any other person or organization connected to or seeking to do business with Operation Smile.</p>\n<p>1.5&nbsp.\nNot accepting any improper payments (i.e.\nbribes, kickbacks or other payments for illegal purposes) from government or non-governmental officials, suppliers or any other person or organization connected to or seeking to do business or otherwise interact with Operation Smile.</p>\n<p>1.6&nbsp.\nNot engaging in any fraudulent activities such as deception, bribery, forgery, extortion, theft, conspiracy, embezzlement, misappropriation, false representation, concealment of material facts and collusion or other acts of deceit in order to obtain a personal or collective advantage, avoid an obligation or cause loss.</p>\n<p>1.7&nbsp;Not using legal financial transactions to hide or dispose of money or property acquired from criminal activity (also known as money laundering).</p>\n<strong>2.\nSTEWARDSHIP</strong>\n<p>Operation Smile will exercise good internal governance with a focus on transparency and accountability.\nEach Operation Smile foundation is accountable for its actions and decisions, not only to its funding agencies and government, but also to all Constituents.\nAuthority, responsibility and accountability should be clearly defined, as well as adequate internal control mechanisms.\nKey areas for which there should be policies and procedures (and which should be reviewed and updated regularly) include:</p>\n<p>2.1&nbsp;Proper authorization, e.g., definition of authorization levels.</p>\n<p>2.2&nbsp;Segregation of duties, e.g., that all payments and reimbursements should require the authorization of two people.</p>\n<p>2.3&nbsp;Good procurement practices.</p>\n<p>2.4&nbsp;Adequate documentation and records retention and destruction policies.</p>\n<p>2.5&nbsp;Independent
