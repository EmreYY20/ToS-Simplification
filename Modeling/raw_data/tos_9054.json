and/or any property.\n(See, <strong>Indemnification</strong> Section 10).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>What Lime Offers</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Lime was founded on the simple idea that all communities deserve access to smart, affordable mobility.\nOur Services help make this idea a reality.\nWe are continually evolving our Services, and as of the date above, they include <strong>electric bikes,</strong>\n<strong>electric scooters</strong>, <strong>adaptive scooters, mopeds</strong> (and for some vehicle types in some locations, their respective docking stations), <strong>helmets</strong>, and any other related equipment provided or made available by Lime.\nIn these Terms, we often refer to these as a \u201c<em>\n<strong>Product</strong>\n</em>\u201d or all them collectively as \u201c<em>\n<strong>Products</strong>\n</em>\u201d.\nOur Services also include our mobile application (the \u201c<em>\n<strong>App</strong>\n</em>\u201d), all other related equipment, maintenance, charging, personnel, our websites (including this one and our e-commerce shop), social media assets, and any other information, technology and services provided or otherwise made available to you in our discretion.\nOur App may also be used with certain user-owned vehicles to provide additional functionality (such as enabling you to locate, lock, and unlock the vehicle) and to enable us to provide the Services to you.\nOur Services may come with additional terms or product requirements, which we will make available to you with the relevant Services and they will become part of your agreement with us when you use them.\nPlease note that we are not a common carrier, we offer our Services as a convenience to those who are able and qualified to operate them, and alternative means of public and private transportation are available to you and the general public.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Your Lime User Account</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Account Set Up</strong>\n</em>.\nIn order to use most aspects of the Services, you must register for and maintain an active personal user account, which requires a valid debit or credit card or other approved payment method with expiration date and billing postal code as well as other requested information depending on the Product (for example, a driver\u2019s license is required for some Products in some jurisdictions).\nAlternative account creation and payment methods are available for some of our Products and Services if they are available in your area, such as <u>LimeAccess</u>.\nWhat you provide to us must be true, accurate, complete and updated as necessary to remain accurate.\nIf applicable, create a username and a strong password and don\u2019t share either with anyone \u2013 your account is personal to you and not intended for anyone else, and you are responsible for all activity that occurs under it.\nLet us know immediately if you suspect unauthorized use of your account.\nWe have the right to provide information about you or your various account details (like billing, account, content or use records and related information) if required by law (which may include mandatory data sharing with governments), and to protect our rights, customers or business.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>A Note on Fraud</strong>.</em> We take it seriously, both for your protection and ours.\nYou may only use a payment method that you have the legal right to use and you authorize us to charge any payment method you designate for any charges you incur.\nIf we suspect that any information you\u2019ve provided is inaccurate, incomplete or fraudulent, we may suspend or terminate your account until the issue is resolved.\nDuring that time, you will lose access to some or all of our Services, either temporarily or permanently.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Using the App and our Services</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once your account is properly set up, you can use the App to locate, reserve and/or access our available Products.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Reservations</strong>\n</em>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please understand that for supply and related reasons, we reserve the right to accept or reject your reservation requests, and your receipt of our confirmation does not necessarily equal acceptance or constitute confirmation of our offer to make the Services available in any particular instance.\nIf your reservation via the App is rejected after your request, you\u2019ll receive the applicable refund assuming your payment method was charged in the first place.\nIf pricing in the App turns out to be incorrect for any reason, we reserve the right to cancel or reject a corresponding reservation and will issue you the applicable refund.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Rules for using our Products</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>You agree to abide by the Rules to Ride applicable to each Lime Product you use.\nEach set of Rules to Ride may be amended by Lime at its sole discretion and the revised Rules to Ride will be posted on the website or in the App.\nYour continued use of the Product after we make any changes to the Product\u2019s Rules to Ride constitutes your agreement to those changes.\nEach set of Rules to Ride are expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms.\nYou can find the Rules to Ride for scooters <u>here</u>, for bikes <u>here</u>, and for mopeds <u>here</u>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Our vehicles are all electric vehicles.\nWe don\u2019t have unlimited amounts of electric vehicles and they aren\u2019t always available.\nThis goes for our other Products too.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Electric vehicles require periodic battery charging to operate.\nTheir level of charge power will decrease with use over both time and distance.\nThey lose their battery charge for various reasons, including due to weather, road conditions, vehicle type and other factors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It is your responsibility to be aware of the level of charge power in the vehicle you are using.\nAs part of our Services, we work diligently to ensure that our vehicles have adequate charge for your general use, but we don\u2019t know where you intend to go, and we can\u2019t guarantee the vehicle you use has enough charge power to get you there.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Group Rides</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For some vehicle types, the Services may allow you to start a \u201cGroup Ride,\u201d and have your guests access Products.\nTo use this feature, you are responsible for ensuring that each of your guests personally read and agree to be bound by the Terms and read our Privacy Notice.\nYou are fully responsible for (1) ensuring that all of your guests are at least 18 years old (or other legal age of majority), (2) any damages and injuries that occur during the Group Ride that are caused by you or your guests, (3) only allowing one guest per vehicle, (4) paying for all of the fees that occur in connection with your Group Ride, and (5) you are legally responsible for all of your guests\u2019 activity as if it was your own.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Be Safe When Using Our Products!</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We want a safe experience for you and those around you in your community, and that means we have some rules.\nAside from simply exercising caution and good judgment, you shouldn\u2019t carry any items (like a briefcase or a bag) or use any device (like a cell phone or other portable device) if they could impair or hinder safe use (no texting while using our Services, for example).\nThere will not always be a designated place for you to ride, such as a bike lane for scooters or bikes, so exercise caution when riding in areas with cars and other traffic (we aren\u2019t responsible for the actions of drivers, pedestrians, or other third parties).\nUnless we expressly permit you to do so (e.g., in a separate set of terms and conditions), you should not handle, charge, remove and/or otherwise tamper with the batteries (whether removable or not) on any Lime vehicle.\nYou are prohibited from using our Services while under the influence of alcohol, drugs or other substances that may affect your ability to safely use our Services.\nDon\u2019t carry other people or animals while using our Services (with some exceptions, like an authorized passenger on a moped - see Rules to Ride Mopeds).\nPlease don\u2019t lock up any Product with a lock that isn\u2019t ours, because then we can\u2019t unlock it (!).\nPlease don\u2019t leave a Product in a manner or location which we can\u2019t access (if everyone did that, there would be no Products to use).\nWe may charge you up to $500 if we are not able to retrieve any Product due to your actions.</p>\n<p>You are also not permitted to use our Services to participate in activities beyond a particular Product\u2019s intended use.\nSome of these are obvious, but for example, no racing, mountain riding, stunts or trick-riding, riding up or down stairs, and don\u2019t take a Product off-road or through massive amounts of water (beyond normal urban riding, of course).\nAll of these uses can damage our Products or cause serious injury or death to you or someone else.\nYou may not use our Services for hire, reward or for any other commercial use (like advertising, ride-sharing or food delivery).\nDon\u2019t tamper with, vandalize or try to gain unauthorized access to our Services.\nAnd of course, do not use our Services in connection with the violation of any law.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Treat Our Products Like They Were Your Own!</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Proper Use</strong>.</em> If all customers treat our Products with respect, more of them will be available to use and in better condition.\nOur Products are unfortunately not indestructible, so please take good care of them when they are in your hands.\nThey have weight limitations, which you can find in the Rules to Ride for that Product.\nYou may not use any Product to tow or haul a trailer, vehicle or other object.\nWe expect you to use the Products safely, including when you carry cargo in general (where the vehicle has a safe place to carry cargo).\nFor example, don\u2019t carry cargo in a bike\u2019s front basket if it blocks your visibility.\nIf you leave any personal belongings on or in our Products or on our premises (and we find them), we\u2019ll hold them for 90 days unless the law requires longer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Damage</strong>\n</em>.\nWe expect that other than normal wear and tear, you\u2019ll return (meaning locking up and/or deactivating) a Product in the same condition in which you received it.\nIf you damage it (accidentally or intentionally), or fail to properly return it and damage occurs, you\u2019ll be responsible for the associated costs.\nThis can get pricey \u2013 you can find the replacement cost of each Product in the Rules to Ride for that Product.\nThe same charges will apply for any Product not returned within 48 hours, which we consider lost or stolen and, depending on the circumstances, we may need to file a police report against you.\nWe also reserve the right to take any action against you that the law allows, including holding you liable for the value of the Product.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Product Pick-Up</strong>.</em> If you are unable to return a Product to a valid area (for example, you have to leave it on private property, in a locked community or an otherwise unreachable area), and you ask that we pick that Product up, we may charge you a pick-up fee of up to $500.\nIf you just plain abandon a Product in a place it shouldn\u2019t be left, you\u2019ll be responsible for all associated fees until it\u2019s recovered, plus a service charge of up to $500.\nWe may charge these amounts in our sole discretion to any payment method in your account and without notice.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Accidents or Damage to Products Generally</strong>.</em> You must report any accident, crash, damage, personal injury, or a stolen or lost Product to us within two (2) hours of the accident or incident, or, in the event you are injured, as soon as reasonably practicable following the accident or incident.\nIf an incident involves personal injury, property damage or a stolen Product, you must also file a report with the local police department within 24 hours of the incident (or, in the event you are injured, as soon as reasonably practicable following the incident).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Insurance</strong>\n</em>.\nFor certain Products and in certain locations, we may provide personal accident coverage and/or rider liability coverage for specified damages arising from your use of a Product if you fully comply with, and was in full compliance with, these Terms and all applicable insurance terms and conditions <u>here</u> at the time of the incident.\nIn some locations, you must have your own motor vehicle insurance to use some of our Products.\nYou agree to use your own motor vehicle insurance as the primary insurance.\nDamages beyond the limits of our insurance and below any applicable insurance deductibles are your responsibility.\nHowever, such personal accident or rider liability coverage does not cover damage that occurs while you are in breach of the Terms or any applicable insurance terms and conditions, and in such an event you will be responsible for the full cost of such damage.\nYou must obtain a police report on any collision to benefit from our liability coverage or excess liability insurance.\nOur coverage is contingent on you paying any and all deductible amounts for each claim and your full cooperation with Lime, investigators, and our insurance partners in the event of an accident or damages to persons or property.\nNoncooperation may result in non-coverage under our insurance policies, as determined by our insurance carrier.\nFor more information on our insurance coverage, exclusions and deductibles, click

&amp.\nPayment</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You may use our Services on a per-ride and/or subscription basis (where subscriptions are available).\nSome rides may have a minimum fee that could be in addition to any applicable start/unlock fee.\nBefore you start a ride, you will see the applicable fees (e.g., start/unlock fee, per minute fee, and/or minimum fee).\nFor the purpose of calculating fees incurred, ride times will be rounded up to the nearest minute.\nPlease note that we may change pricing for our Services at any time as we deem necessary or appropriate for our business.\nOur pricing is exclusive of taxes (like sales and value added) and other applicable governmental charges.</p>\n<p>We may put a temporary hold on your debit/credit card account before you start a ride to verify your payment information is still valid and/or to verify your debit/credit card has the necessary funds to cover the fees incurred for that ride.\nPre-authorization is not a charge to your account, it is a hold on those funds.\nPre-authorizations can reduce your available balance by the authorization amount until it is released or reconciled with the actual charge.\nYou should contact your bank or card issuer if you have questions about when a pre-authorization amount will be removed from your statement.</p>\n<p>Fees and charges will be charged to a payment method in your account.\nWe will automatically charge and withhold the applicable taxes as required by law.\nAll payments to us are made through a third-party payment processor.</p>\n<p>If your payment method expires and you do not update your information or you cancel your account, you authorize us to continue billing, and you will remain responsible for any uncollected amounts.\nWe reserve the right to retry billing all payment method(s) on file after any failed billing attempt.\nYou will remain liable for all such amounts and all costs incurred in connection with the collection of these amounts, including, without limitation, bank overdraft fees, collection agency fees, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, and arbitration or court costs.</p>\n<p>If you disagree with any charges we have made to your account, you must let us know within 10 business days from the end of the month in which the disputed charge took place.\nTo resolve any disputed charges, we will need certain trip information, including the date and approximate start and end times of your trip.\nAs a policy, except to the extent required by applicable laws, we do not offer refunds for your use of our Services, and any exceptions to this policy are in our sole discretion.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Referral and/or Promotional Codes</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At various times, we may provide referral and/or promotional codes for discounted trips or other features on our Services, which may be subject to additional terms that we make available to you.\nPlease understand that these are one-time offers, are only redeemable via the App (unless otherwise stated in the promotion terms) and we may modify or cancel them at any time.\nUnless we state otherwise in the specific promotion terms, we limit these to 1 per user and account, they can\u2019t be combined with other offers, they are not valid for cash, they will expire in accordance with their terms, and are not transferable or permitted to be resold.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Subscriptions.\nFree Trials.\nLimited Discounts</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We may offer our Services under different payment options, including without limitation free trials, subscriptions, limited time offers, or other options.\nFree trials may convert into paid subscriptions in accordance with the offer terms.\nThe terms will be set forth in each offer for such Services.\nPlease read the offer terms carefully before accepting them.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Fines and Fees</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We may at our sole discretion assess fines, fees, or penalties and/or take other actions for your violation of these Terms.\nFor example, you may incur fees or fines if you leave a Product outside the service area, use a Product in a prohibited area, leave a Product unlocked, or cause damage or loss to a Product.\nIn some locations, we are required by the municipality to impose fines for improper use of our Products, including without limitation improper parking or reckless riding behavior.</p>\n<p>In addition, when you are using our Services, you must comply with the laws that apply to you.\nIf you receive a ticket or a fine (e.g., for your violation of parking or traffic rules and regulations), cause a Product to be towed and/or impounded or receive any other penalties or fees, you\u2019ll be responsible for the associated costs.\nWe cooperate with all governmental officials in their enforcement of the applicable laws, and for expediency we may pay amounts you owe on your behalf and provide any necessary information requested or required by the applicable government agencies.\nIf we do so, you are required to pay us back.\nIf we had to use third party collection or administrative agents to resolve or attempt to resolve the issue, you are also responsible for paying us an administrative fee up to $100.\nBy agreeing to these Terms, you agree that we may pay the amounts directly and charge these amounts (including the administrative fee) to any payment method indicated in your account, and we may need to contact you for additional information.</p>\n<p>In locations where we pay the municipality a fee in order to provide the Service to you, we reserve the right to pass a portion of this cost onto you.\nWe will communicate to you the amount of such pass-through fee before you start a ride.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Warranty Disclaimers</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We

legal case, please first try contacting our Customer Support.\nMost disputes can be resolved that way.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>We each mutually agree to resolve any justiciable disputes between us exclusively through final and binding arbitration instead of filing a lawsuit in court.\nThis arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1-16) (\u201c<em>\n<strong>FAA</strong>\n</em>\u201d) and will apply to any and all claims arising out of or relating to your access or use of the Services, any communications, advertising or marketing by or regarding us or the Services, any products or services sold or distributed through the Services that you received as a consumer of our Services, any aspect of your relationship or transactions with us, any of our actual or alleged intellectual property rights, and all other aspects of your relationship with us, past, present or future, whether arising under federal, state or local statutory and/or common law (collectively, the \u201c<em>\n<strong>Dispute</strong>\n</em>\u201d).\nWe each also expressly agree that this Agreement will be governed by the FAA even in the event you and/or we and/or these Terms are otherwise exempted from the FAA.\nAny disputes in this regard shall be resolved exclusively by an arbitrator.\nIf, but only if, the arbitrator determines the FAA does not apply, California law governing arbitration agreements will apply.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Class Action Waiver</u>\n</strong>.\n<strong>We each mutually agree that by entering into this agreement to arbitrate, we both waive our right to have any dispute or claim brought, heard or arbitrated as, or to participate in, a class action, collective action and/or representative action, and an arbitrator shall not have any authority to hear or arbitrate any class, collective or representative action (\u201c<em>Class Action Waiver</em>\u201d).</strong> In any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective or representative action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the class, collective and/or representative action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration.\nNotwithstanding any other clause contained in this Section 18, any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.\nAll other disputes with respect to whether this Mutual Arbitration Provision is unenforceable, unconscionable, applicable, valid, void or voidable shall be determined exclusively by an arbitrator, and not by any court.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Any Dispute shall be determined by final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules.\nIf you bring a claim subject to arbitration, you will pay toward the fees and deposits imposed by the AAA or other arbitrator only an amount equal to the amount you would have had to pay as filing fees and initial court costs if you had filed suit in a court of competent jurisdiction.\nLime will pay the remainder of the fees and deposits of arbitration.\nIf, however, any laws require Lime to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 18 to be enforceable, then we will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration.</li>\n<li>\n<p>If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the \u201cmetropolitan statistical area\u201d (as defined by the U.S.\nCensus Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration.\nThe arbitrator or arbitration panel, as the case may be, will apply and be bound by this Section 18 and any additional terms, and will determine any Dispute according to applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including arbitrability.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Except as provided in the Class Action Waiver, the arbitrator may award all remedies to which a party is entitled under applicable law and which would otherwise be available in a court of law, but shall not be empowered to award any remedies that would not have been available in a court of law for the claims presented in arbitration.\nThe arbitrator shall apply the state or federal substantive law, or both, as is applicable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This Mutual Arbitration Provision will survive any termination of the Services and/or your relationship with us.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This Mutual Arbitration Provision is the full and complete agreement relating to the formal resolution of disputes covered by this Mutual Arbitration Provision.\nThis Section 18 can be amended only by our mutual written agreement.\nIn the event any portion of this Mutual Arbitration Provision is deemed unenforceable, the remainder of this Mutual Arbitration Provision will be enforceable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Small Claims Matters Are Excluded from Arbitration Requirement</strong>: Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Lime may bring a Dispute in small claims courts of competent jurisdiction.\nLime reserves the right to reject your request for arbitration for any Dispute which can be resolved in small claims courts.</p>\n</li>\n</ol> Join Us <ul>\n<li> Careers\n</li>\n<li> Lime Times Blog\n</li>\n<li> Press\n</li>\n<li> Partners\n</li>\n</ul> About <ul>\n<li>
