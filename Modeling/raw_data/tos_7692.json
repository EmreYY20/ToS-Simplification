that all disputes and claims between you and the H&amp;R Block Parties shall be resolved through binding individual arbitration unless you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement using the process explained below.\nHowever, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, either you or the H&amp;R Block Parties may elect that an individual claim be decided in small claims court, as long as it is brought and maintained as an individualized claim and is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the arbitrability of disputes and the validity, enforceability, and scope of this Arbitration Agreement, including the interpretation of and compliance with sections 11.2, 11.4, and 11.6 below, shall be decided by a court and not an arbitrator.\nThe terms <strong>\"H&amp;R Block Parties\"</strong> or \"we\" or \"us\" in this Arbitration Agreement include HRB Digital LLC, HRB Tax Group, Inc., and Emerald Financial Services, LLC, along with their predecessors, successors, and assigns, and each of the past, present, and future direct or indirect parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers,

address, the first five digits of your Social Security Number, and the words \"Reject Arbitration.\" If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, any prior arbitration agreement shall remain in force and effect.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>11.2\t<strong>Commencing arbitration.</strong> You or we may commence an arbitration proceeding only if you and we do not reach an agreement to resolve the dispute or claim during the Informal Resolution Period (defined below).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>(A)\t<strong>Pre-arbitration notice of dispute.</strong> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first mail a written Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\") to the other party.\nThe Notice to the H&amp;R Block Parties should be addressed to: H&amp;R Block-Legal Department, Attention: Notice of Dispute, One H&amp;R Block Way, Kansas City, MO 64105.The Notice to you will be sent to the last known address on file with the H&amp;R Block Parties.The Notice must be on an individual basis and include all of the following: (1) the claimant's name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address.\n(2) the nature or basis of the dispute or claim.\n(3) the specific relief sought.\nand (4) the claimant's signature.</li>\n<li>(B) <strong>Informal Settlement Conference.</strong> After the Notice containing all of the information required above is received, within 60 days either party may request an individualized discussion (by telephone or videoconference) regarding informal resolution of the dispute (\"Informal Settlement Conference\").\nIf timely requested, the parties will work together in good faith to select a mutually agreeable time for the Informal Settlement Conference.\nYou and our business representative must both personally participate in a good-faith effort to settle the dispute without the need to proceed with arbitration.\nThe requirement of personal participation in an Informal Settlement Conference may be waived only if both you and we agree in writing.\nAny counsel representing you or us may also participate.\nhowever, if you have retained counsel, a signed statement is required by law to authorize the H&amp;R Block Parties to disclose your confidential tax and account records to your counsel.\nAny applicable statute of limitations will be tolled for the claims and relief set forth in the Notice during the period between the date that either you or we send the other a fully complete Notice, until the later of (1) 60 days after receipt of the Notice.\nor (2) if a Settlement Conference is timely requested, 30 days after completion of the Settlement Conference (the \"Informal Resolution Period\").\nThe parties agree that the existence or substance of any settlement discussions are confidential and shall not be disclosed, except as provided by applicable law.</li>\n<li>(C) <strong>Enforcement of pre-arbitration requirements.</strong> The Notice and Informal Settlement Conference requirements are essential so that you and we have a meaningful chance to resolve disputes informally before proceeding to arbitration.\nA court will have authority to enforce this section 11.2, including the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration or the assessment of or demand for payment of fees in connection with an arbitration, if you or we do not first provide a fully complete Notice and participate in a timely requested Informal Settlement Conference.\nIn addition, unless prohibited by applicable law, the arbitration administrator shall not accept, assess or demand fees for, or administer an arbitration commenced during the Informal Resolution Period.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>11.3 <strong>How arbitration works.</strong> Arbitration shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules (\"AAA Rules\"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.The AAA Rules are available on AAA's website <u>www.adr.org</u>.\nIf AAA is unavailable or unwilling to administer the arbitration consistent with this Arbitration Agreement, the parties shall agree to, or the court shall select, another arbitration provider.\nUnless the parties agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing shall take place in the county of your residence.\nIf you accept this Agreement outside the United States, the arbitration hearing shall take place in the county in which you last resided in the United States.\nThe arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney specifically licensed to practice law in the state of your residence and selected by the parties from the arbitration provider's national roster of arbitrators.\nThe arbitrator will be selected using the following procedure: (1) the arbitration provider will send the parties a list of five candidates meeting this criteria.\n(2) if the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator from the list, each party shall return its list to the arbitration provider within 10 days, striking up to two candidates, and ranking the remaining candidates in order of preference.\n(3) the arbitration provider shall appoint as arbitrator the candidate with the highest aggregate ranking.\nand (4) if for any reason the appointment cannot be made according to this procedure, the arbitration provider will provide the parties a new list of five candidates meeting the above criteria until an appointment can be made.</p>\n<p>11.4 <strong>Waiver of right to bring class action and representative claims.</strong> All arbitrations shall proceed on an individual basis.\nThe arbitrator is empowered to resolve the dispute with the same remedies available in court, including compensatory, statutory, and punitive damages.\nattorneys' fees.\nand declaratory, injunctive, and equitable relief.\nHowever, the arbitrator's rulings or any relief granted must be individualized to you and shall not apply to or affect any other client.\nThe arbitrator is also empowered to resolve the dispute with the same defenses available in court, including but not limited to statutes of limitation.\n<strong>You and the H&amp;R Block Parties also agree that each may bring claims against the other in arbitration only in your or their respective individual capacities and in so doing you and the H&amp;R Block Parties hereby waive the right to a trial by jury, to assert or participate in a class action lawsuit or class action arbitration, to assert or participate in a private attorney general lawsuit or private attorney general arbitration, and to assert or participate in any joint or consolidated lawsuit or joint or consolidated arbitration of any kind.\n</strong> If, after exhaustion of all appeals, a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this section's limitations as to a particular claim or any particular request for a remedy for a claim (such as a request for public injunctive relief), then the parties agree that the particular claim or the particular request for a remedy (and only that particular claim or particular request for a remedy) must remain in court and be severed from any arbitration.\nNo arbitration shall proceed in any manner as a class action arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims, unless all parties consent in writing.</p>\n<p>11.5 <strong>Arbitration costs.\n</strong>Payment of all filing, administrative, case-management, arbitrator, and hearing fees will be governed by AAA Rules, but if you inform us that you cannot afford to pay your share of the fees, we will consider advancing those fees on your behalf and will do so if required by applicable law.\nIn addition, we will reimburse you for your share of the fees at the conclusion of the arbitration (regardless of who wins), so long as (i) you complied with sections 11.2 and 11.4 above and section 11.6 below, and (ii) neither the substance of your claim nor the relief you sought was determined to be frivolous or brought for an improper purpose as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b).\notherwise, the payment of fees will be governed by AAA Rules and you agree to reimburse the H&amp;R Block Parties for all fees advanced on your behalf.</p>\n<p>11.6 <strong>Arbitration of similar claims.</strong> If 25 or more claimants submit Notices or seek to file arbitrations raising similar claims and are represented by the same or coordinated counsel (regardless of whether the cases are submitted simultaneously), all of the cases must be resolved in arbitration in stages using staged bellwether proceedings if they are not resolved during the Informal Resolution Period.\nYou agree to this process even though it may delay the arbitration of your claim.\nIn the first stage, each side shall select 10 cases (20 cases total) to be filed in arbitration and resolved individually by different arbitrators, with each case assigned to an arbitrator from the claimant's home state.\nIn the meantime, no other cases may be filed in arbitration, and the AAA shall not accept, assess or demand fees for, or administer arbitrations that are commenced in violation of this section.\nThe arbitrators are encouraged to resolve the cases within 120 days of appointment or as swiftly as possible, consistent with principles of fundamental fairness.\nIf the remaining cases are unable to be resolved after the conclusion of the first stage bellwether proceeding, each side shall select up to another 10 cases (20 cases total) to be filed in arbitration and resolved individually in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement.\nDuring this second stage, no other cases may be filed in arbitration.\nIf any claims remain after the second stage, the process will be repeated until all claims are resolved through settlement or arbitration, with two alterations.\nFirst, a total of 50 cases may be filed each round (unless a higher number of cases is mutually agreed upon in writing).\nSecond, arbitrators who were assigned cases in previous rounds may be appointed to new cases.\nIf this section 11.6 applies to a Notice, the statute of limitations applicable to the claims and relief set forth in that Notice shall be tolled from the beginning date of the Informal Resolution Period until that Notice is selected for a bellwether proceeding, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved.\nA court will have authority to enforce this section 11.6, including to enjoin the filing, assessing or demanding fees for, administration of, or prosecution of arbitrations.</p>\n<p>11.7 <strong>Other terms.</strong> This Arbitration Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted, construed, and enforced in accordance with, the Federal Arbitration Act and other applicable federal law.\nExcept as set forth above in section 11.4, if any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of the Arbitration Agreement.\nNotwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we will not make any material change to this Arbitration Agreement without providing you with an opportunity to reject that change by following the directions in the notice of changes.\nRejection of any future change will not impact this or any other arbitration agreement between you and the H&amp;R Block Parties.\nNo arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to any issues or claims in any dispute, arbitration, or court proceeding where any party was not a named party in the arbitration, unless and except as required by applicable law.</p> Back to Top <p>\n<strong>12.\n<u>SMS Text Messages.</u>\n</strong> You can receive different types of text messages from us, including refund
