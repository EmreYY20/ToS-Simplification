Satisfaction Guarantee Buy Our Products With Confidence <p>Our products are a great fit for 99.9% of our customers, but if you find yourself in that .1%, just <strong>contact us within 30 days</strong> and we will refund the entire amount.\nLife is too short for unhappy customers, and software that's not a great fit.\nWe have a A+ rating with the BBB, and we want to keep it.</p>\n<p>If you have experienced a problem, we would really appeciate the opportunity to try to help you so we can learn from your experience.\nIf you'll do us the favor of discussing the source of your disappointment, we will vigorously attempt to resolve the issue for you.\nAnd you can still get a refund if we can't fix it (or if you just want a refund anyway).\n<strong>Contact our support team for assistance</strong>.</p>\n<p>We appreciate it if you contact us before contacting your credit card company, since that just slows things down and makes everything more difficult for both of us.</p>\n<p>Prior to purchasing, we encourage all customers to take advantage of the free trial period offered on all of our products.</p> *What isn't included in this guarantee? <ul> Darn near everything is included.\nBut here are a few exceptions that are beyond our control.\nWe want to be upfront about them.\n<li>If you have placed your order through a reseller, we may need to refer you back to the reseller so that you can make your refund request through them.\nWe may not be able to initiate the refund on our own.</li>\n<li>Some resellers may have a shorter return policy than ours, and their return policy may prevail.\nIn no case can a reseller's return policy exceed ours in terms of length.</li>\n<li>Certain items on your order form may not be refundable, such as CD backups or third-party professional services.</li>\n<li>If you purchased your product through Share-it, Digital River, or an I.T.\nreseller, you are subject to their terms and conditions.</li>\n<li>If you purchased your product as part of a bundle of other products, it may not be possible for us to provide a refund where a specific amount is not charged for our products.</li>\n<li>We cannot provide refunds on pre-paid subscriptions or services.</li>\n<li>Professional services rendered by Encryptomatic LLC are performed on a contractual basis are non-refundable.</li>\n<li>Product maintenance services that have alredy been consumed, include upgrade and support contracts or renewals, are non-refundable.\n</li>\n<li>Products for which we are an authorized reseller, such as MailStore, are subject to the vendor's terms of service.</li>\n<li>Please be patient.\nIf you bought your software today and need a refund, our credit card processor does not allow us to make a refund until the first transaction has settled.\nIn other words, we are prohibited from returning funds that have not been received.\nIt may take a day or two to settle, after which we will happily return your funds even if the settlement stretches beyond the 30 day period.</li>\n</ul> Connect With Us <ul>\n<li>Support</li>\n<li>Receive a Quote</li>\n<li>Contact Us</li>\n<li>About Us</li>\n<li>Blog</li>\n<li>End

Information with certain third parties to help us use your Personal Information, as described above.\nFor example, we use Ultracart to power our online store including the shopping card hosted at secure.encryptomatic.com \u2013 you can read more about how Ultracart uses your Personal Information here: www.ultracart.com/legal/privacypolicy.html.\nWe also use Google Analytics to help us understand how our customers use the Site\u2013you can read more about how Google uses your Personal Information here: //www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.\nYou can also opt-out of Google Analytics here: //tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</p>\n<p>Generally, when any information is shared with our vendors it is to assist Encryptomatic LLC market its products and acquire customers for

regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING <p>As described above, we use your Personal Information to provide you with targeted advertisements or marketing communications from Encryptomatic LLC (such as new product announcements, update announcements or special product pricing) that we believe may be of interest to you.\nFor more information about how targeted advertising works, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative's (NAI) educational page at //www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work.</p>\n<p>You can opt out of targeted advertising by:</p>\n<p>FACEBOOK \u2013 //www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads<br> GOOGLE \u2013 //www.google.com/settings/ads/anonymous<br> BING \u2013 //advertise.bingads.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/policies/personalized-ads</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can opt out of some of these services by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance's opt-out portal at: //optout.aboutads.info/.\n</p>\n<p>As a small business, we utilize the common advertising platforms that are available to us and other U.S.A.-based small businesses to market our products, but we are not the provider of the platform.\nYour efforts to control your privacy are well served by making your preferences known directly to the major platform provides, including Facebook, Google, Bing, among others.\nControlling your information on these platforms will necessarily impact the data that these platforms provide to us or collect from us, and will affect the methods we can use to reach you with our advertising messages.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> DO NOT TRACK <p>Although we would like to respect Do Not Track (DNT) requests, we find that we are hamstrung by the larger advertising platforms we need to use to conduct our business, and therefor we have little control over web browser Do Not Track requests.\nCompanies like Google, for example, do not natively respect DNT and limit our ability to force then to respect DNT.\nIn the past we've tried writing JS code to only fire Google Analytics requests if DNT is not detected, but this simply has not been effective or stable.\nSince using Google's platform is a necessary way for us to reach customers with news about our products, it places us in a difficult \"all or nothing situation, where we either respect DNT by removing the entire Google platform, or we stay in business by using those platforms without any resonable control over DNT.\nYou may be able to use Google's analytic's opt-out browser add-in to impact DNT requests.\nIt's a worth a look, anyway.\nFor the time being, until we ourselves are able to effectively respect DNT requests, or until major platform provides like Google provide us this capability, please assume that we unable to, and therefor do not, alter our Site's data collection and use practices when your browser sends a Do Not Track signal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> YOUR RIGHTS\n<p>If you are a European resident, you have the right to access personal information we hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted.\nIf you would like to exercise this right, please contact us through the contact information below.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you are a European resident we note that we are processing your information in order to fulfill contracts we might have with you (for example if you make an order through the Site), or otherwise to pursue our legitimate business interests listed above.\nAdditionally, please note that your information will be transferred outside of Europe to our servers in the United States.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> DATA RETENTION <p>When you place an order through the Site, Encryptomatic LLC will maintain your Order Information for our records unless and until you ask us to delete this information.\nWe retain customer contact information indefinitely or at our discretion, so we can provide customer support services, product updates and security notices.\nWe may retain this information on our own servers, or on the servers of 3rd parties that provide CRM or other business services to us, such as Ultracart or Hubspot.For example, if you bought a product from us 10 years ago and now you need our assistance to recover a lost product key, our customer support team will use this information to assist you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> CHANGES <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal
