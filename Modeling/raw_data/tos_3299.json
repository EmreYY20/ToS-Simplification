use other kinds of local storage technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as \u201cFlash cookies\u201d) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Business Services.\nThese technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences.\nHowever, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings.\nFor information about disabling or deleting information contained in Flash cookies, please click&nbsp;here.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Beacons</em>\n</p>\n<p>We, along with certain third parties, also may use technologies called beacons (or \u201cpixels\u201d) that communicate information from your device to a server.\nBeacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device.\nWe and certain third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Business Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that are
