time to time for various reasons including (without limitation) commercial reasons, to comply with law or regulation, to comply with instructions, guidance or recommendations from regulatory bodies, or for customer service reasons (e.g., to keep up to date with any changes to the Services).</p>\n<p>3.2 If we make material changes to the Terms of Use, we will give you as much prior notice of such

mobile messages when you log into your Account and/or by email.\nYour continued use of the Services after changes are made (and, where material, notified to you as described above) will be deemed to be your agreement to the changes.\nIf you do not agree to the changes, then you must not continue to use the Services, but you will always be able to withdraw your funds (subject to any rights we may have under the Terms of Use to withhold funds).</p>\n<p>3.3 The date on which each relevant document comprising the current Terms of Use came into (or will come into) force will be stated at the

criminal offence in certain jurisdictions \u2013 please see clause 5.2 below for more information about what happens if we discover that you are underage);<br>\n4.1.2 you are of sound mind and capable of taking responsibility for your own actions and you can enter into a legally binding agreement with us;<br>\n4.1.3 you will provide accurate registration information, including without limitation

behalf of any third party in connection with your Account;<br>\n4.1.5 you are not an undischarged bankrupt or in a voluntary arrangement with your creditors;<br>\n4.1.6 you are not located in a country where the use of the Services is prohibited, including Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Cyprus, Denmark, France (and French territories), Germany, Italy, Macau, New Zealand, Nigeria, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, the United States of America (and US territories), Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, and any other country with a comparable legal situation (each a \"<b>Prohibited Territory</b>\").\n<br>\n4.1.7 you will not attempt to sell or otherwise transfer the benefit of your Account to any third party and nor will you acquire or attempt to acquire an Account which has been opened in the name of a third party;<br>\n4.1.8 you will comply with your own local, national, federal, state or other laws concerning betting and gaming prior to opening an Account, placing any bets, or using our Services;<br>\n4.1.9 you are not prohibited for any reason from betting with us or any member of the Betfair group of companies, or from

may be made at any time before or after you open an Account), promptly provide any documentation or information which we request in order to evidence your identity, age, address, country of birth or authorisation to use a particular credit or debit card (and you agree that we may perform checks in order to verify any such documentation or information).<br>\n</ul>\n<p>4.2 For various legal, regulatory, commercial and/or other reasons, we do not permit Accounts to be opened by persons who are located in Prohibited Territories, and we do not permit Accounts to be accessed or operated (either deliberately or accidentally) in those Prohibited Territories.\nYou agree not to bypass any measure we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Services.</p>\n<p>4.3 It is your responsibility to keep your Account details up-to-date.\nFailure to do so may result in you failing to receive important Account related notifications and information from Betfair.</p>\n<p>4.4 You are solely responsible for the security and confidentiality of your Account.\nIn particular, you agree to keep your username, password and/or telephone account number (<b>TAN</b>) strictly confidential.\nOther than where due to our negligence, you are responsible for any misuse of your password and/or TAN unless and we will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of misuse of your username, passwords and/or TAN.\nPlease note that when you create an Account you have the option to use your email address or a username to log in to/identify your Account.\nYou should keep in mind that the use of email addresses as usernames can reduce the security levels of your Account as your email address may be more accessible and this makes it easier for third parties to gain access to your Account.</p>\n<p>4.5 Provided that we have been correctly supplied with the Account information requested, we are entitled to assume that any activity occurring under/using your correct Account credentials is undertaken or authorised by you.\nYou should change your password on a regular basis and never disclose it to any third party.\nYou agree to protect your username and password in the same way that you would in respect of your bank cards and any failure to do so shall be at your sole risk and expense.\nIf another person accesses your Account and save where due to our negligence, you are solely responsible for all their actions \u2013 including any losses arising from those actions \u2013 whether or not their access was authorised by you.</p>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<b>\n<u>\n</u>\n</b>\n<u>\n</u>\n<li>\n<u>\n<b>Account Verification and Due Diligence</b>\n<br>\n<br>\n</u>\n<ul>\n<p>5.1 The following information must be provided during the

of age and/or address from you (and we may suspend or restrict your Account until you provide such evidence).\nUnderage gambling is a criminal offence in certain jurisdictions including (but not limited to) Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.\nIf you are located in these or other applicable jurisdictions, you will not be permitted to gamble until we have verified your name, address and date of birth.\nIf we discover (after you have successfully registered and opened an Account) that you are under 18 years of age, your net losses incurred during the period you were underage will be returned to you, any open bets will be voided, and we may make a report to the relevant regulatory or law enforcement authorities.</p>\n<p>5.3 As noted above, you must enter all mandatory information requested into your registration form, all of which must be true, complete and correct.\nYou authorise us to carry out identification, credit and other verification checks that we may require and/or are required by applicable laws and regulations and/or by the relevant regulatory authorities.\nYou agree to provide all requested information in connection with these verification checks.</p>\n<p>5.4 We'll try and conduct our verification processes electronically where possible, but if we are unable to do so, or if the check is inconclusive, we may ask you to provide us with personal identity documents.\nThe identification documents that we may request that you provide to us can be found here.\nFor non-UK customers, identity verification is triggered in line with regulatory requirements and may be required at various stages/upon various triggers including (but not necessarily limited to) on Account registration, at certain deposit levels, and/or based on other risk factors.</p>\n<p>5.5 As a licensed gambling operator and in compliance with our legal and regulatory obligations we are required to conduct a number of checks during the whole time that you have an Account with us.\nIn order to meet our regulatory obligations, we may ask that you provide personal details and/or documentation relating to your financial circumstances.\nThe documents that we may request that you provide to us in such circumstances can be found here.\n</p>\n<p>5.6 You agree to provide all such information as we reasonably require, in the form that we require it, from you from time-to-time.\nIf you do not or cannot provide us with the information that we need, we are entitled to restrict your Account in any manner that we reasonably deem appropriate, including preventing you from accessing the Services, placing any bets, stakes or wagers (together \"<b>Bets</b>\"), or from withdrawing your funds.\nYour Account may also ultimately be suspended or permanently closed in accordance with clause 13.</p>\n<p>5.7 You accept that all transactions may be checked to prevent money laundering and that any transactions made by you which we deem to be suspicious may be reported to the appropriate authorities.\n</p>\n<p>5.8 When deciding whether to accept your application for an Account, we may supply the information you have given us to authorised third parties to confirm your age, identity and registered payment details.\nThey will check any details we disclose to them against any databases (public or private) to which they have

than one Account, each such additional Account will be classified as a \"<b>Duplicate Account</b>\".\nIf we discover that you hold one or more Duplicate Accounts, we will (in respect of each Duplicate Account):\n</p>\n<ul>\n6.1.1 close the Duplicate Account(s) or the original Account (as applicable), leaving you with only one Account (unless we have reason \u2013 for example if you have deliberately or fraudulently opened more than one active Account \u2013 to close <u>all</u> of your Accounts);<br>\n6.1.2 treat all bonuses and free bets, and all winnings accrued from such bonuses and free bets, obtained using the Duplicate Account as void.\nand<br>\n6.1.3 void all future Bets made on the Duplicate Account.<br>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<b>\n<u>\n</u>\n</b>\n<u>\n</u>\n<li>\n<u>\n<b>Deposits, Protection of Your Funds, and Withdrawals </b>\n</u>\n<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<p>\n<b>\n<u>Deposits and Protection of Your Funds</u>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>7.1 To bet or to play games for money via the Services, you need to deposit funds.\nExcept as set out below, all funds in Accounts are held by The Sporting Exchange (Clients) Limited, a group company established solely for the purpose of holding customer funds (the \"<b>Trustee</b>\"), under the terms of the Trust Deed (the \"<b>Trust Fund</b>\").\nHolding your money in the Trust Fund has the following benefits to you:\n</p>\n<ul>\n7.1.1 if Betfair (or any other operating company within the Betfair group) becomes subject to any insolvency proceedings, then your money will not be available to administrators/liquidators (or similar) and so you will be able to withdraw your money from your Account as normal except where the Terms of Use permit us to withhold funds;<br>\n7.1.2 the law of equity (which governs this Trust Fund) provides additional remedies to all beneficiaries of the Trust Fund (i.e.\nto all Betfair customers) that may not otherwise exist in a contractual relationship (e.g., a duty to act in good faith).\nand<br>\n7.1.3 we have a number of additional controls in place over the Trust Fund to protect your money.<br>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>7.2 This arrangement meets the Gambling Commission's requirements for the protection of customer funds at the level: \"<b>high protection</b>\".\nFor more information, please visit:\nhttps://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/public-and-players/guide/what-happens-to-your-money-if-a-gambling-business-goes-bust</p>\n<p>7.3 Your funds will not be held by the Trustee if: (i) there is a requirement for such funds to be held under the terms of any licence, in a separate non set-off bank account in the name of the licence holder.\nor (ii) where such funds are deposited via a third party payment provider (hereafter referred to as a \"<b>Payment Provider</b>\").\nFunds deposited via a Payment Provider may take a few days before they are held by the Trustee under the terms of Trust Deed.\nDuring this period your funds will be held in the account of the relevant Payment Provider and will not be protected under the terms of the Trust Deed.\nDepositing by any method other than the following will be classed as a deposit via a third party Payment Provider: (a) bank transfer, (b) cheque, (c) credit card and (d) debit card.</p>\n<p>7.4 The funds in your Account are held on your behalf by way of security to meet any payment obligations you may incur as a result of betting or playing games on the Website or using any of the Services supplied by Betfair.\nDetails of the manner in which the Trust is operated are set out in the Trust Deed.\n</p>\n<p>7.5 You accept that you will not be entitled to receive any interest in respect of your deposits (for more information see clause 5 of our Trust Deed), and you acknowledge that you shall not treat Betfair as a financial institution.\n</p>\n<p>7.6 The methods available for deposit of funds can be found once you are logged into your Account, and then by clicking on the \"Deposit\" button found at the top right-hand side of our home page.\nFor more information see

confirmed as cleared and have not been charged-back, reversed or otherwise cancelled;<br>\n7.7.2 we have completed any verification checks to our reasonable satisfaction (see clause 5).\nWhere we have requested information from you to carry out these checks, any delay in providing this information may cause delay when withdrawing funds.\nand<br>\n7.7.3 there is currently no ongoing, or completed, investigation:\n<ul>\n<li>into suspicious or irregular betting patterns and/or possible instances of event manipulation and/or cheating (see clause 12).\n</li>\n<li>into money-laundering or the financing of terrorism, including where we suspect that you have been using the proceeds of crime to gamble with us;</li>\n<li>into an Error, Malfunction or Interruption involving any aspect of the Services which you have played or participated in (see clause 10).\nor</li>\n<li>where we have reasonable grounds to believe you may have engaged in an illegal activity or Prohibited Activity (as defined in clause 11) which would entitle us to withhold funds in accordance with clause 13,<br>\nand in these cases you acknowledge and understand that, as we made clear in the \"<b>Important Note</b>\" at the beginning of these General Terms, we ultimately have the right (depending on the particular circumstances) to void any affected transactions, withhold attributable winnings and (in the case of illegal and Prohibited Activities) suspend/close your Account with us, and make appropriate disclosures to the police and other relevant authorities.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>7.8 The methods available for withdrawal of funds can be found once you are logged into your Account by clicking on the \"My Account\" icon and then (a) FOR MOBILE, by selecting the \"Withdraw\" button and selecting the payment method you would like to withdraw the funds to, and (b) FOR DESKTOP, by selecting the \"My Betfair Account\" from the drop-down menu, where you will see the \"Withdraw\" option available.\nCustomers may withdraw any amount from their \"Main Wallet\".\nAmounts showing in either the \"Sportsbook Bonus\", \"Casino Bonus\" or \"Exchange Game Bonus\" may be subject to applicable wagering requirements before being available to withdraw.\nFor an example of how wagering requirements work with respect to Casino, please see here.</p>\n<p>7.9 Withdrawals will generally be remitted only to the financial/bank account from where the funds paid into the customer's Account originated.\nFor more information click here and here.\n</p>\n<p>7.10 The average time required for deposit/withdrawals via each of the methods available can be found here.</p>\n<p>7.11 For customers in England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, Isle of Man, Jersey, and Guernsey:, Credit cards are not accepted as a form of deposit or withdrawal payment.\nReferences to credit cards in the remainder of these General Terms shall be relevant for all other jurisdictions but not the territories listed in this clause.</p>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<b>\n<u>\n</u>\n</b>\n<u>\n</u>\n<li>\n<u>\n<b>Maximum Winnings Limits</b>\n<br>\n<br>\n</u>\n<ul>\n<p>8.1 As we made clear in the '<b>Important Note</b>' at the beginning of these General Terms, maximum winnings limits apply to some of our Services and these limits apply regardless of stake.\nThe maximum winnings for each Account shall be as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n8.1.1 with respect to any sports betting transactions placed through the Services: the maximum payout to any one customer in any twenty four hour period regardless of size of stake or number of bets are as set out in the Sportsbook Rules and Regulations.\nCurrency equivalent maximum payouts will apply for any currency not listed in the Sportsbook Rules and Regulations.<br>\n8.1.2 with respect to any gaming Services: the maximum winnings for any one wager or gameplay transaction shall be as set out in the applicable Betfair Gaming Conditions of Use and/or in the game rules for the applicable game.<br>\n</ul>\n<p>8.2 We will try to ensure that Bets which could result in potential winnings which will exceed the maximum payout limit for a particular event/market will not be accepted.\nHowever, due to technical and other limitations, it is not always possible to prevent such Bets from being accepted.\nAs maximum payout limits vary depending on the particular Service type, we strongly encourage all customers to check the limits set out in applicable Service rules before placing their Bets, particularly if the potential winnings (i.e., absent the maximum winnings limit) would be in excess of \u00a3/\u20ac1,000.\nAs we made clear in the '<b>Important Note</b>' at the beginning of these General Terms, you will <b>only</b> be entitled to receive up to the maximum winnings limit regardless of the amount of your stake and no matter how much you appear to have 'won'.</p>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<b>\n<u>\n</u>\n</b>\n<li>\n<b>\n<u>Privacy and Cookies</u>\n<br>\n<br>\n</b>\n<p>The information that you provide to us or that we collect from you will be processed in accordance with our Privacy Policy.\nOur Cookie Policy sets out information about our use of cookies in connection with the Services.\n</p>\n</li>\n<b>\n<u>\n</u>\n</b>\n<li>\n<b>\n<u>Errors, Malfunctions, and Interruptions</u>\n<br>\n<br>\n</b>\n<ul>\n<p>10.1 Betfair makes every effort to ensure that no errors are made in prices offered or bets accepted.\nHowever, human and/or systems error may occasionally result in errors.</p>\n<p>10.2 In this clause 10 we set out a description of the things that can go wrong and the rights that we have in such events.\nYou should be aware however that this clause does not override or cancel out any rights that you may have under consumer laws and regulations and we do not intend that they should.</p>\n<p>10.3 Below are some key definitions to help you understand this clause:<br>\n<br>\nA \"<b>Malfunction</b>\" refers to where an automated process fails to operate as designed or intended, for example where a piece of computer software produces a deviation from its intended performance specifications or parameters, or where two pieces of software fail to interface or communicate with each other in the manner intended or designed, in either case so as to produce a result which is not the result that was intended or designed.\nThese malfunctions may or may not be apparent to us or to You and they may only come to light as and when settlement instructions, game outcomes, winnings or cashouts are investigated and analysed retrospectively.<br>\nAn \"<b>Error</b>\" refers to a mistake or error that is not exclusively technical, for example the mistaken posting of incorrect odds, the offer of incorrect prices or terms for participation in a promotion or gambling opportunity.\nErrors can arise from human mistakes, administrative, operational or systems failures and combinations of all of these.\nFor example, a bet might be offered mistakenly at a price that is substantially out of the market, or \"each way\" is offered in a market when the pricing of the market clearly indicates that it should have been \"win only\", or a promotion designed to offer a \u00a35 return might mistakenly advertise a \u00a350 return or the pay-tables advertised for a product may mistakenly fail to reflect the true payment configuration of the product.<br>\nAn \"<b>Interruption</b>\" refers to an interruption in a gambling transaction for any reason, for example an interruption caused by the failure of the internet or connectivity, or severe latency in communications, or technical failure due to some disaster or unforeseen event.</p>\n<p>10.4 Where any of the above occur, we will deal with them as described below and it is important that you understand and agree to the following before you use the Services, as we made clear in the '<b>Important Note</b>' at the top of these General Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Malfunctions</b>\n</p>\n<p>10.5 If as a result of a Malfunction, your Account is credited with winnings that you would not have received were it not for that Malfunction, we will have the right to void the relevant transaction and withhold the relevant winnings.\nThis applies even if the relevant gambling product could have produced the same or similar amount of winnings without the intervention of the Malfunction and it applies whether the Malfunction was apparent to you or to us or not.\nIf we have paid out on any such Bets or gaming activities and/or if you have withdrawn any such winnings, such amounts shall be deemed to be held by you on trust for us and shall be immediately repaid to us when a demand for payment is made by us to you.</p>\n<p>10.6 Where any Malfunction is or becomes apparent or obvious to you or you suspect that a Malfunction may be occurring, you agree that you will cease your use of the relevant Service(s) immediately, and will report it to us immediately.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Errors</b>\n</p>\n<p>10.7 In the event of an Error, the same applies as for Malfunctions, as set out above.\nFor sports betting markets only, in the case of any errors in prices transmitted (including so-called 'palpable', 'obvious', or 'blatant' errors, for example where the price being displayed is materially/significantly different from those available in the general market and/or the price is clearly incorrect, depending on all of the circumstances), Betfair may settle Bets at the correct price at the time of acceptance (or the Starting Price in the case of horse-racing, whichever is the greater).</p>\n<p>10.8 Where any Error is or becomes apparent or obvious to you or you suspect that an Error may be occurring, you agree that you will cease your use of the relevant Service(s) immediately, and will report it to us immediately.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Interruptions</b>\n</p>\n<p>10.9 Our priority is to ensure that we deal with Interruptions in a way that is fair and does not systematically disadvantage our customers.\n</p>\n<p>10.10 In relation to betting: we are entitled to suspend betting markets, void bets and return stakes to customers.</p>\n<p>10.11 In relation to gaming:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>where an Interruption occurs after we receive notification of your gamble and where you can have no further influence on the outcome of the event or gamble, the results of the gamble will stand;</li>\n<li>where an Interruption to a single-participant single stage event occurs before an outcome has been generated we will return your stake to your Account;</li>\n<li>for games where there are multiple stages or decision points we will take all reasonable steps to restore the game to its last known state prior to the Interruption to enable you to complete the game;</li>\n<li>for games with multiple participants (equal chance or otherwise) we will deal with these as seems fairest to us (acting reasonably) on a case-by-case basis.\nand</li>\n<li>for games that are progressive jackpots, progressive jackpot values will be restored to their pre-failure state to the extent it is within our control and not the games provider.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<b>\n<u>\n</u>\n</b>\n<li>\n<b>\n<u>Prohibited Activities </u>\n<br>\n<br>\n</b>\n<ul>\n<p>11.1 You may only use the Services, including your Account,

consequences of you doing so, as we made clear in the '<b>Important Note</b>' at the beginning of these General Terms, will (depending on the particular circumstances) include the voiding of any relevant transactions, the withholding of any winnings, and the suspension and/or closure of your Account.</p>\n<p>11.2 The following activities are prohibited (each a \"<b>Prohibited

using to access the Services;<br>\n11.2.4 if we have received a \"charge-back\" and/or a \"return\" notification via a deposit mechanism used on your Account;<br>\n11.2.5 if you use the Services other

country where you are located.\n<br>\n11.2.13 if we suspect (acting reasonably) that your Account's usage represents 'business usage' ('business usage' includes any use by a betting operator or any use by an individual or organisation supplying data or services to a betting operator);<br>\n11.2.14 if you are prohibited from entering into a Bet by any term of your contract of employment or any rule of a sport governing body or other professional body which applies to you.\n<br>\n11.2.15 if you place a Bet on any sporting match or event in which you take part, or you otherwise break any of the rules or conditions relating to the placing of Bets;<br>\n11.2.16 if you place a Bet on or manipulate any individual Market (defined in clause 18.1) in a manner which we believe (acting reasonably) has the purpose or effect of adversely affecting the integrity of the Exchange (defined in clause 18.2) or any Market;<br>\n11.2.17 if you transmit or provide any information or otherwise engage in any activity (such as, for example, so-called \"courtsiding\") that assists a third party in the placing of Bets on any sporting event or contest whilst you are located in any territory where it is illegal to do place such Bets;<br>\n11.2.18 if you procure or arrange for a third party to transmit or provide information or otherwise engage in any activity (such as, for example,

if you intentionally match Exchange bets against your own account (or related account) with the intention of adversely affecting or manipulating a Market for your (or a related account's) benefit;<br>\n11.2.20 if you attempt to use the Exchange to deliberately transfer money from one Account to another by attempting to match bets on a Market with another Account through collusion;<br>\n11.2.21 if you become bankrupt, if you do not make payment of a court judgment on time, if you make an arrangement with your creditors, or if any of your assets are the subject of any form of seizure, or if analogous proceedings are brought in relation to you anywhere in the world.\n<br>\n11.2.22 if you breach the terms of any promotion, for instance if you have opened more than one Account to take advantage of a promotion which was limited to one per customer;<br>\n11.2.23 if you engage in any abusive, offensive or otherwise inappropriate behaviour towards other users of our Services (e.g., during gameplay, via our chat functions, etc.) or towards our staff;<br>\n11.2.24 if you breach the Terms of Use in some other material or serious way.\nor<br>\n11.2.25 if we become aware that you have played at any other online gambling site (including any site operated by a member of Betfair's group of companies) and, in connection with the same, you are suspected of or have engaged in any of the activities described in this clause 11.2.<br>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<b>\n<u>\n</u>\n</b>\n<li>\n<b>\n<u>Suspicious Betting</u>\n<br>\n<br>\n</b>\n<ul>\n<p>12.1 For the purpose of this clause 12, \"<b>suspicious betting</b>\" refers to where we have reasonable grounds to believe that a Bet or a number of Bet have been placed in suspicious circumstances.\nSuspicious betting shall include, but not be limited to:\n</p>\n<ul>\n12.1.1 where there is an inordinate frequency and/or highly unusual pattern of Bets (by comparison with betting norms) placed on the same selection(s) in a short space of time;<br>\n12.1.2 where there is an inordinate frequency and/or highly unusual pattern of Bets placed on the same selection(s) and where the theoretical probability of said selection(s) winning at the time of Bet(s) placement, based on the odds offered on the selection(s) at the time of Bet placement, is largely inconsistent with the theoretical probability of the same selection(s) winning calculated using their accumulated starting prices.\nBy way of illustrative example only, if there was an inordinately large number of Bets placed on a multiple or permutation with combined odds of 250/1 (with a theoretical 0.004% probability of winning based on the odds) and that same multiple or permutation had combined odds of 12/1 based on the Starting Prices of the selections (a theoretical 7.7% probability of winning), this may trigger the suspicions contemplated by this clause 12.1.2;<br>\n12.1.3 where the integrity of an event (or events) has been called into question, including, for example, but not limited to where one (or more) of the participants in an event displays exceptional form which we reasonably believe was known to you or someone connected to you at the time of Bet placement but was concealed from the public generally in order to gain an unfair advantage in any Bets placed on that event (or those events);<br>\n12.1.4 where we have reasonable grounds to suspect that a Bet or a string of connected Bets were placed robotically, by automated means, or otherwise than through the Account holder placing each Bet manually via their Account (for the avoidance of doubt, this does not include bets placed via the Application Programming Interface (API);<br>\n12.1.5 where we reasonably believe that you have used unfair external factors or influences connected with the event(s) the subject of any Bet(s);<br>\n12.1.6 where we reasonably suspect that you have opened one or more Duplicate Accounts or where we reasonably suspect that second or subsequent accounts are under common control with your Account with a view to concealing the true worth, nature or pattern of Bets placed by you or on your behalf, even if second or subsequent accounts are opened under different names;<br>\n12.1.7 where we otherwise believe, acting reasonably, that you are acting in concert with others or that you are acting other than on your own behalf.\nor<br>\n12.1.8 where we reasonably believe that Bets have been placed from a location or device other than the location or device which you claim to have used to place a Bet.\nor <br>\n12.1.9 where we identify a pattern of Bets that have been placed in quick succession by different or the same Account holder(s) that have a combined liability which exceeds what we would expect to accrue on similar Bets during a particular time period based on long term established betting trends.\nFor example, we would regard a series of Bets placed on the same or similar selections in quick succession after 9:30pm and before 8:00am by different Account with a combined liability that exceeds \u00a3100,000 as suspicious as this is conflicts with our long term established betting trends.<br>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>12.2 If we discover or have reason to believe that you have participated in any of the activities described in clause 12.1 (which, as stated in clause 11.2, constitute \"Prohibited Activities\"), we shall have the rights set out in clause 13.\n</p>\n<p>12.3 Where a Bet is deemed to be, or is declared, void by us prior to an event, any sum deducted from your Account with respect to that Bet shall be credited to your Account.</p>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<b>\n<u>\n</u>\n</b>\n<li>\n<b>\n<u>Suspension or Termination of Your Account by Us</u>\n<br>\n<br>\n</b>\n<ul>\n<p>13.1 If we have reasonable grounds to suspect that you have engaged in any Prohibited Activity, we will suspend your Account without notification, and your Account will remain suspended while the matter is investigated.\nYou agree to cooperate fully with any such investigation.\nYour funds cannot be accessed or withdrawn during periods of suspension, and any balance will remain in the Account.\nWe may also make a report to the relevant regulatory or law enforcement authorities.</p>\n<p>13.2 If our investigation results in our decision (acting reasonably) that the issue has been resolved to our satisfaction, we will lift the Account suspension.\nIf our investigation results in our decision (acting reasonably) that you have engaged in any Prohibited Activity, we will restrict or permanently close your Account.\nIn these circumstances, your details may be passed on to any applicable regulatory or law enforcement authorities or any other relevant external third parties.</p>\n<p>13.3 We may also from time to time be required by a competent authority to restrict, suspend or close Accounts for legal or regulatory reasons.\nSuch restrictions, if applicable, may affect your use of your Account.\n</p>\n<p>13.4 We are also entitled to close your Account at any time for any reason (and without the obligation to provide a reason) by giving you no less than 14 days' written notice.</p>\n<p>13.5 Any balance in your Account at the time of any closure by us will be paid back to you, <b>except that</b>:\n</p>\n<ul>\n13.5.1 if you have engaged in illegal activity, we are under no obligation to refund to you any money that may be in your Account.\nand<br>\n13.5.2 if we discover or determine (acting reasonably) that you have participated in any Prohibited Activities then we will void any affected transactions/Bets/string of connected Bets, withhold all or part of your Account balance which is attributable to those Prohibited Activities, recover from your Account deposits, pay-outs, bonuses and/or any winnings (if/as applicable) which are attributable to those Prohibited Activities and/or take any other action that we deem necessary.\nIf you have withdrawn any sums which are attributable to Prohibited Activities, such sums shall be deemed to be held by you on trust for us and must be immediately repaid to us when a demand for payment is made by us to you.<br>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<b>\n<u>\n</u>\n</b>\n<li>\n<b>\n<u>Inactive Accounts</u>\n<br>\n<br>\n</b>\n<ul>\n<p>14.1 Save as set out in the clause

your gambling or if, for any other reason, you wish to stop gambling.\nTo this end, we may retain such personal data as is necessary (and for as long as is necessary which may be indefinitely) to implement the self-exclusion facility (including for example your name, address and credit/debit card details).</p>\n<p>15.4 To activate our self-exclusion facility, please contact the Customer Services team or visit the 'Safer Gambling Tools' page which is available in the 'My Account' section of the Website.</p>\n<p>15.5 Our self-exclusion facility involves a joint commitment between Betfair and you.\nDuring a period of self-exclusion, we will take reasonable steps to prevent you re-opening your Account or opening a new Account but you must not attempt to re-open your Account or to try and open new Accounts.</p>\n<p>15.6 You agree that you will not access/attempt to access any other Betfair account to use any of the Services from which you have excluded, during the period of any such self-exclusion.\nYou agree that: (i) if you hold accounts with both Betfair and Paddy Power, Sky Betting and Gaming, and/or PokerStars and have self-excluded from an account on any of these sites, you will not access any account which you hold on any of these sites (and we are entitled to prevent you from attempting to access such other site) and (ii) if you hold an account with either Betfair or Paddy Power, Sky Betting and Gaming, and/or PokerStars and have self-excluded from any of these sites, you will not attempt to register an account with any of these sites during your period of self-exclusion (and we are entitled to prevent you from registering an account with such other site).\nWe shall not be liable for any losses you or any third party may suffer if you circumvent our self-exclusion procedures and continue to use our Services or if you continue to gamble with any Betfair group business or third party.\nYou will inform us as soon as you become aware of any errors in respect of your self-exclusion or any other safer gambling mechanisms that we make available to you.</p>\n<p>15.7 Self-excluding from Betfair will not affect your marketing preferences with third parties, including with advertising websites or other third party affiliates.\nWe strongly recommend that you also contact such third parties and opt out from receiving any gambling related communications from them.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Self-exclusion and Paddy Power accounts</b>\n</p>\n<p>15.8 With effect from 30 December 2016, if you apply a self-exclusion to your entire Betfair account, we will also try to prevent you from accessing any account which you hold with Paddy Power (for the same period of self-exclusion that applies to your Betfair account) (a \"<b>Full Exclusion</b>\").\nHowever, there may be circumstances (including where we are unable to link your Betfair account to your Paddy Power account) where we are unable to do so.\nFor certainty, we therefore recommend that, where you apply a self-exclusion to your Betfair account, you also do so to your Paddy Power account (and any other online account which you hold).\nTo request a self-exclusion on Paddy Power, please either contact the Paddy Power Customer Services team or visit the 'Safer Gambling Tools' page which is available in the 'My Account' section of the Paddy Power website.\n</p>\n<p>15.9 Please note that, if you applied a self-exclusion to your Betfair account before 30 December 2016, we will not automatically take steps to apply that self-exclusion to your Paddy Power account.\nIn these circumstances, we recommend that you separately seek a self-exclusion to your Paddy Power account (and any other online account which you hold).\nIf you applied a self-exclusion to your Betfair account before 30 December 2016 and also wish to self-exclude from your Paddy Power account, you can do so via your online Paddy Power account or, alternatively, by contacting our customer services.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Self-exclusion and other accounts</b>\n</p>\n<p>15.10 If you choose to self-exclude from and including 8 June 2022 (the \"Commencement Date\") with Betfair, Paddy Power, Sky Betting and Gaming and/or PokerStars on all products by way of an all-product self-exclusion, the self-exclusion will be replicated on any other accounts you hold with the above operators, without any further reference to you, providing we can match the account details with those on the self-excluded account.\nWhere you are self-excluded with one of the above brands and an account with another operator is matched or registered after the Commencement Date, any active self-exclusion (including those placed before the Commencement Date) will be replicated at that stage.\nShould you believe that your account has been incorrectly matched resulting in an erroneously applied self-exclusion, please contact our customer service team.\nIn any event, we recommend that you separately seek a self-exclusion to any account(s) you hold with these operators.\nPlease note that this clause does not apply to Sky Betting and Gaming customers and PokerStars customers based outside of the United Kingdom, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Isle of Man and British Oversees Territories.\nAny self-exclusion applied to Betfair and Paddy Power accounts outside of the United Kingdom, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Isle of Man and British Oversees Territories will not be replicated on Sky Betting and Gaming and PokerStars accounts.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Self-exclusion and The Stars Group

general</b>\n</p>\n<p>18.1 Registered Account holders can enter into various betting transactions in relation to the markets available via the Website (\"<b>Markets</b>\").</p>\n<p>18.2 Where customers bet with each other on Betfair's Exchange markets (the \"<b>Exchange</b>\"), Betfair acts as a facilitator and does not act as a counterparty.\nHowever, Betfair may act as a counterparty on the Exchange but only in the following limited situations:\n</p>\n<ul>\n18.2.1 <b>for wagers between Australasian Customers</b>: Betfair also offers Tote bets, as well as singles (which we call \"Fixed Odds\") and \"Multiples\" bets at odds fixed by us;<br>\n18.2.2 <b>for Betfair's Starting Price ('SP' or 'Betfair SP') on the Exchange</b>: The Betfair SP is calculated by Betfair, by balancing all SP bets and other Exchange bets when the market is suspended at the 'off' of the relevant event.\nBetfair group may act as risk counterparty to SP bets if necessary to ensure a fair SP.\nThe Betfair personnel involved in determining the SP in such circumstances will have no undeclared personal or other interest in the SP in question.\nWhen you place a bet at SP you are betting against other Betfair customers.\nHowever, during the reconciliation of the Betfair SP, Betfair acts as counterparty in order to balance liabilities between Betfair SP bets and other Exchange bets.\nand<br>\n18.2.3 occasionally (and such bets represent a tiny fraction of the overall volume of betting activity on the Exchange), in one of the two following circumstances:<br>\n<ul>\na.\non less liquid markets to improve \"liquidity\" and stimulate market activity (\"liquidity\" is the amount of money available for you to bet on each selection).\nWe may do this on ancillary markets (particularly when the market is first made available) or on markets on less popular events.\nThe rationale for providing this liquidity is to enhance the betting proposition for our customers.\nand<br>\nb.\nin order to reduce the Betfair group's liability against a particular outcome.\nWe may do this on a high-profile event where our sportsbook has a very large exposure to that outcome.<br>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>18.3 You can enter into betting transactions either on our Website/apps, by telephone, or by the Application Programs Interface (API)(i.e., direct API access &amp.\nlicensed third party 'API' apps that enable betting on the Exchange).\nPlease note that not all Betfair betting products are available through each of the foregoing betting channels.\nIn this clause 18 when we refer to the \"<b>Betting Services</b>\" we mean all the services listed in this clause 18.3 (where applicable).\n</p>\n<p>18.4 In this clause 18, references to \"Betfair\", \"we\", \"us\" and/or \"our\" are to whichever Betfair group company is providing the Betting Services to you as set out in the Specific Conditions applicable to your betting transaction (see clause 2.2 above where these Specific Conditions are listed and linked-to).</p>\n<p>18.5 As listed and linked-to in clause 2.2 above, there are separate rules, terms and conditions for each of our Exchange and Sportsbook products (i.e., the Exchange Rules and Regulations and the Sportsbook Rules and Regulations).\nThe rules governing how Markets are offered, managed and/or settled are not the same for every Market on each product.\nIn certain circumstances, a Bet that is settled as a winner on one product may be settled as a loser on the other product (and vice versa).\nAdditionally, different settlement rules may apply so that, for example, Bets that are winners on one product may be settled as a dead heat or be voided on the other product.\nCustomers must ensure that they familiarise themselves with the relevant rules that apply to the Bets that they place on Betfair's products.</p>\n<p>18.6 As noted in clause 2.3 above, if there is any inconsistency between the documents listed above and these General Terms, these General Terms will to that extent take precedence.</p>\n<p>18.7 We are entitled to determine when the Markets are open for betting and to close the Markets at any time in our discretion.\nThough we will at all times use reasonable endeavours to settle Markets as quickly as reasonably possible, we cannot give any assurances as to the timeframe in which Markets will be settled.</p>\n<p>18.8 You are responsible for the information that you provide to us concerning the offer that you wish to place.\nWe will not be liable for incorrect entries made by you, including data input errors with respect to the odds, price or stake on offer, or incorrect Bet requests communicated by you to a Betfair telephone operator.\nIf a Betfair telephone operator repeats back your Bet request incorrectly, it is your responsibility to correct the Bet request and inform the Betfair telephone operator of the error.\nOnce you have confirmed the Bet request to the Betfair telephone operator (whether or not that was the original Bet that you requested) and your Bet is matched, you will be liable for that Bet if it loses.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Suspension/voiding of Markets/Bets</b>\n</p>\n<p>18.9 Betfair is entitled to suspend betting on a Market at any time (even if such suspension is earlier than anticipated by the Exchange Rules and Regulations and/or Sportsbook Rules and Regulations).\nIn the interests of maintaining integrity and fairness in the Markets, Betfair may also void certain Bets in a market or void a whole Market in its entirety \u2013 see the Exchange Rules and Regulations and the Sportsbook Rules and Regulations for more information.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Bots</b>\n</p>\n<p>18.10 Some customers make use of programs designed to automatically place bets within certain parameters set by them (e.g., to back or lay at a certain price) (\"bots\").\nThese bots may be active in any or all Markets at any time and you should not assume that you can place bets on quiet Markets that will not be automatically matched simply because the Market otherwise appears quiet.\nAdditionally, bot users should be aware that bots might be prone to exploitation by other customers.\nUsers of these programs do so entirely at their own risk.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Cancelling an offer for a Bet</b>\n</p>\n<p>18.11 You may request to cancel unmatched Bets at any time either by (a) requesting a cancellation of the relevant offer in the relevant section of the relevant Market on the Website.\nor (b) instructing a Betfair telephone operator to request a cancellation of the relevant offer.\nYour cancellation of an unmatched bet becomes effective once we send you confirmation of the cancellation.\nIn the event that your cancellation request is not received and processed in good time, you acknowledge that your offer may remain outstanding and available for acceptance.\nYou may not be able to cancel if your Bet has been partially or wholly accepted during the interval between your submitting your cancellation request and our confirming your cancellation.\nIn this case, your original offer, or part thereof, will be validly accepted and the Bet will be concluded.\n</p>\n<p>18.12 When you amend an unmatched Bet you are effectively cancelling that Bet and submitting a new Bet at the amended stake or odds.</p>\n<p>18.13 We will cancel any offers for Bets that remain outstanding at the time that we close a Market.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Minimum and maximum Bet stakes</b>\n</p>\n<p>18.14 Depending on the product or type of Market you are betting on and depending on the currency that you are betting in, there are minimum Bet sizes that apply.\nThese minimum Bet sizes are subject to change and may differ depending on how you are placing your Bet (e.g., whether via the Website or using the Telephone Betting Service).\nYou are not permitted to place (or try to place) Bets that are below the minimum bet size threshold.</p>\n<p>18.15 Your maximum betting limit is represented by the lesser of: (i) your 'Available to Bet' balance shown in your Account and (ii) your \"Exposure Limit\" (which is available in the \"Account Summary\" tab in \"My Account\").\nHowever, in the event that we process an offer for a Bet or the acceptance of a Bet in an amount outside the applicable thresholds, such Bet will nevertheless stand except where the Terms of Use permit us to void Bets and/or withhold funds.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Bet Settlement</b>\n</p>\n<p>18.16 Subject to this clause 18 and anything contained in any Specific Conditions, and save where the Terms of Use entitle us to void or withhold winnings, we will settle Markets in accordance with our Exchange Rules and Regulations and Sportsbook Rules and Regulations (as applicable).\nWe are entitled to reverse or amend settlement in the event of a Market being settled incorrectly.\nThis may lead to amendments being made to your Account to reflect changes in Market settlement and if there are insufficient funds in your Account we may require that you put funds into your Account to address the outstanding balance.\nWe will notify you if your Account goes into a negative balance (i.e., that you owe Betfair money) and, if following the notification, you either:\n</p>\n<ul>\n18.16.1 do not put funds in your Account within the reasonable time specified in our notice to you;<br>\n18.16.2 you fail to make the relevant payments into your Account in accordance with any repayment plan as agreed between you and Betfair.\nor<br>\n18.16.3 you indicate to Betfair that you have no intention of putting funds in your Account to address the outstanding balance,<br>\nthen as we made clear in the '<b>Important Note</b>' at the top of these General Terms, we can set off the positive balance in your Account against amounts that you owe to us.\nWe will also be entitled to take appropriate legal action to seek to recover the debt.<br>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>18.17 Any amount of winnings or losses relating to your Bets on a Market will be rounded to the nearest two decimal places.\nIf the amount ends in 0.5 it will be rounded up.\n</p>\n<p>18.18 You may not place Bets or try to place Bets which deliberately take advantage of Betfair rounding off to the nearest penny or cent.\nAny Bets which seek to do so will be automatically cancelled.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Commission and payment structure</b>\n</p>\n<p>18.19 We charge a commission calculated by reference to your net winnings on a Market.\nYour stakes for Bets placed on the Exchange are therefore not relevant for the calculation of the commission you pay.\nIn particular, these stakes do not represent remuneration for the Betting Services in connection with the Exchange.\nIn certain specified circumstances, you may also incur certain other charges.\nPlease refer to Betfair Charges in the About Us section which sets out in detail how all commission and charges are calculated.\nWe may to amend our policy as set out in Betfair Charges from time to time \u2013 see clause 3 above for how we handle amendments to the Terms of Use (including the Betfair

Software<br>\n<p>Betfair grants you a limited licence to download (if necessary) and to use the relevant software for the Game(s) you wish to play (the \"<b>Software</b>\") provided that you comply with these Gaming Conditions of Use and any other applicable part of the Terms of Use, including the General Terms (and we draw your attention in particular to clause 19 of the General Terms).\nIf you become aware that the Software is being used in any manner not authorised by these Gaming Conditions of Use or the General Terms, you must immediately notify our Customer Services team.</p>\n</li>\n<li>APIs<br>\n<p>You must place all wagers on Games through the various user interfaces provided on our Website and, other than any use of Betfair's endorsed API service (which you may use to place bets within certain parameters on Betfair's Exchange Games), you may not wager through other means, including the use of a \"robot\" player.\nOther than your permitted use of Betfair's endorsed API service (referred to above), the use of programmes or software designed to automatically place bets within certain parameters (i.e., \"robot\" players) is not permitted on any Games (including Poker, Casino, Exchange Games, Bingo or any other Games) on any part of our Website.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Games nicknames/aliase<br>\n<p>You may not choose a Games nickname and/or alias

clause.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Changes to the Games<br>\n<p>Betfair may withdraw or alter any Game(s) or any part thereof (including prices, features, specifications, capabilities, functions and/or other characteristics) and may add new Games at any time.\nBetfair will ensure that any such changes will not adversely affect any promotion or offer that customers are currently wagering towards.\nIn the unlikely situation that a proposed change to a Game may impact a customer\u2019s ability to take part in a promotion or bonus they are currently wagering towards, Betfair will (i) notify all customers taking part in the relevant promotion to explain the change and (ii) make arrangements to ensure that customers are not adversely affected by the change, for example, by providing suitable alternative Games which will qualify for the promotion at the same level of play.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Game Rules<br>\n<p>Specific rules also apply to each of the Games \u2013 these can be found on each Game's information page on the Website.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these Game rules before accessing the relevant Game(s) as they will be binding on you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Return to Player percentages for certain Games offered by Betfair<br>\n<p>This clause applies specifically to certain Games which are tested by Betfair via the use of Random Number Generators (\"<b>RNGs</b>\").</p>\n<p>The Return to Player (\"<b>RTP</b>\") percentage of a fixed odds Game represents the theoretical payback of Game over time expressed as a percentage of total amount staked.\nFor certain Games offered by Betfair, this theoretical payback percentage is verified by running a large number of transactions - typically in the range of 10 million - through the Game to ensure that the expected payback is within an expected range of the theoretical RTP.\nFor those Games, the result is generated by an RNG, which guarantees that each Game outcome is generated independently and entirely randomly.</p>\n<p>Both the testing of the RTP and the RNG are completed by an independent, accredited testing house who perform certification testing on behalf of the appropriate licensing body for each Game.</p>\n<p>Details of the RTP percentages which are relevant to each of Betfair's applicable Games are included on each Game's information page.</p>\n<p>For the avoidance of doubt, Betfair does not guarantee that any of the Games it offers will pay out according to its RTP percentage in a single hand, spin or play (or, indeed, to an individual customer).</p>\n<p>Betfair warrants and represents that it is, in respect of the Games it offers, compliant with the RTP requirements of all the appropriate licensing bodies (including the Return to Player Directive 2016 issued by the Malta Gaming Authority).</p>\n</li>\n<li>Conditions Specific to Poker Games<br>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<u>Company and licensing details</u>\n</p>\n<p>Betfair is licensed

game.<br>\nb.\nMoving from a low weighted game (25% or less) to a high weighted game (100%) after large wins for the purpose of clearing wagering requirements.\nFor example, you place at least one bet
