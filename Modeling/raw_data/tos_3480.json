Information.\nWe will generally not disclose your Personal Information to unaffiliated third parties.\nSpecifically, we do not share, sell or rent your Personal Information to third-party advertisers, \"spammers\", or anyone else who we know will use it for their own advertising or marketing purposes.\nWe will, however, disclose your Personal Information under the limited circumstances listed below:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Consent - </b>We will disclose your Personal Information to a third-party when you specifically instruct us in writing to do so.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Tax Returns - </b>When you prepare and file a tax return using the Software and Services, that tax return, and the Personal Information that you include in it, will be provided to the taxing authority with whom the tax return is filed.\nThe IRS and any applicable state taxing authority will use this information to process your return.\nIn addition, each year the IRS analyzes data from tax returns to monitor tax-filing trends, improve its processes, prevent fraud, and promote its services.\nThe IRS currently requires that all returns filed through the Free File program (including those filed through the Services) indicate that they originated from the Free File program, and may use that information consistent with IRS rules governing the collection and use of taxpayer data.\nOn-Line Taxes does not control and takes no responsibility for IRS use of Personal Information.\nThe IRS requires that your IP address be linked to your Personal Information.\nThe IP address includes the IP address itself, and also includes, but is not limited to, date, time and time zone information.\nAccordingly, we treat your IP address as \"Personal Information\" and will protect it as such, as outlined in this Privacy Policy.\nIn addition, in an attempt to detect fraud, we provide your IP address to the applicable taxing authority when you file your tax return using the Services.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Third-Party Providers - </b>We may disclose certain Personal Information to third-party service providers who help us maintain the Web Site, Software, or the Services through the Web Site.\nFor example, Tax Products Group (TPG) provides \"pay from refund\" services.\nIf you request either of these services, we will disclose the Personal Information contained in your tax return to them so that they can process and evaluate your request for these services.\nWe will also disclose your Financial Information to the institutions and companies who will process your payment for the Services.\nWe use Right Now to host our customer service pages.\nThey do not have access or control of your Personal Information entered on these pages and they are not allowed to use it for their promotional purposes.\nWhere possible, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that these third-party service providers are obligated to protect your Personal Information on our behalf.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b> Emergencies and Disclosure Required by Law - </b>We reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information without your consent to prevent an emergency, to protect or enforce our rights, to protect or enforce the rights of a third-party, as required or permitted by law (including, without limitation, to comply with a subpoena or court order), in response to an inquiry or request from regulatory authorities, or to protect against fraud.\nYou should note that the taxing authorities frequently request information regarding our user's use of the Software and Services, and we comply with such requests.\nIf On-Line Taxes, Inc.\nis involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal\ninformation.\nIn certain situations, OnLine Taxes

Security</b>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The security of your personal information is important to us.\nWhen you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we
