Information Security</strong>\n<br>On the basis of legitimate interest, we process Personal Data for fraud prevention and network and information security purposes.\nPursuant to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), organizations have a recognized legitimate interest in collecting and processing Personal Data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of preventing fraud and ensuring network and information security.\nAccording to the GDPR, network and information security means the ability of a network or of an information system to resist events, attacks or unlawful or malicious actions that could compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted data, or the security of the related services offered by, or accessible via those networks and systems.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Both as an organization in our own right, and as a provider of payment security services and cybersecurity technologies and services, it is in our legitimate interests as well as in our customers\u2019, to collect and process Personal Data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of preventing \u201cFraudulent Payment Transactions\u201d and ensuring the security of our own, and of our customers\u2019 payment transactions and information networks and systems.\nThis includes the development of payment transaction records and of threat intelligence resources aimed at maintaining and improving on an ongoing basis our ability to detect Fraudulent Payment Transactions, and the ability of networks and systems to resist unlawful or malicious actions and other harmful events affecting information networks and systems (\u201cCyber-Threats\u201d).</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The Personal Data we process for the prevention of Fraudulent Payment Transactions include, without limitation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Information related to electronic means of payment and related entitlements;</li>\n<li>Information related to electronic payment transactions;</li>\n<li>Contextual signals and indicators of suspected fraud;</li>\n<li>Verification information to confirm or dispel suspected fraud.\nand</li>\n<li>Evidence of suspected, detected and/or confirmed fraud.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The Personal Data we process for network and information security purposes include, without limitation, network traffic data related to Cyber-Threats such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sender email addresses (e.g., of sources of SPAM);</li>\n<li>recipient email addresses (e.g., of victims of targeted email cyberattacks);</li>\n<li>reply-to email addresses (e.g., as configured by cybercriminals sending malicious email);</li>\n<li>filenames and execution paths (e.g., of malicious or otherwise harmful executable files attached to emails);</li>\n<li>URLs and associated page titles (e.g., of web pages broadcasting or hosting malicious or otherwise harmful contents).\nand/or</li>\n<li>IP addresses (e.g., of web servers and connected devices involved in the generation, distribution, conveyance, hosting, caching or other storage of Cyber-Threats such as malicious or otherwise harmful contents).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Depending on the context in which such data is collected, it may contain Personal Data concerning you or any other data subjects.\nHowever, in such cases, we will process the data concerned only to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate to the purposes of detecting, blocking, reporting and mitigating the Fraudulent Payment Transaction or Cyber-Threat of concern to you, and to all organizations relying on our products and services to secure their payment transactions, and information networks and systems.\nWhen processing Personal Data in this context, we will only seek to identify data subjects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to the extent that it is an inherent part to the services that our customers hire us to perform for them, and as such it is strictly indispensable to the prevention of the fraud and/or the remediation of the Cyber-Threat concerned, or</li>\n<li>if and as required by law.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If you believe that your Personal Data was unduly collected or is unduly processed by Broadcom for such purposes, please refer to the \u201cYour Rights\u201d and \u201cContact Us\u201d sections below.\nPlease be aware that if it is determined that Personal Data concerning you is processed by Broadcom because it is critical for the prevention of Fraudulent Payment Transactions, or the detection, blocking or mitigation of Cyber-Threats, then in certain cases the legitimate interest to pursue such processing may be compelling enough to override access, objection, rectification or erasure requests related to the data concerned.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Automated Individual Decision-Making And Profiling</strong>\n<br>Where Broadcom processes payment transaction security or network traffic data for the purpose of fraud prevention, respectively network and information security, automated decisions concerning particular payment transactions or cyber events may occasionally be made.\nThis could involve in particular assigning relative payment fraud risk, respectively cybersecurity risk scores to ongoing or recent payment transactions, information network activities or system behaviors.\nSuch automatically-assigned risk scores may be leveraged by you, by Broadcom, by our partners and by other customers to detect, block and mitigate the detected Fraudulent Payment Transaction or Cyber-Threat.\nThey could therefore result in said partners and customers blocking payment transactions they deem to be fraudulent, halting network traffic coming from or going to suspected or known malicious addresses.\nSuch processing is not intended to produce any other effect than protecting you, Broadcom, our partners and our other customers from fraudulent payment transactions, respectively Cyber-Threats.\nShould you nevertheless consider that such automated processing is unduly affecting you in a significant way, please contact directly the relevant data controller whose use of our products and services is thus impacting you.\nIn case that data controller is Broadcom, please refer to the \u201cYour Privacy Rights\u201d and \u201cContact Us\u201d sections of this Policy to raise your concerns and to seek our help in finding a satisfactory solution.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Processing Of Pseudonymous Data To Improve the Performance of Broadcom Hardware</strong>\n<strong>\n<br>\n</strong>Certain mobile devices equipped with a Broadcom GPS chip occasionally require querying Broadcom's geolocation assistance server.\nAt the user\u2019s request when launching a geolocation service on their device, the chip will transmit to Broadcom over TCP/IP the device's then-current broad city-level location.\nIn response, the server will designate to the chip the then-relevant satellites to connect to.\nThis service reduces the time needed for the chip to achieve accurate GPS location from about 15 minutes to less than 1 minute.\nBroadcom does not manually access, inspect, disclose, retain, correlate or reuse any of the data associated with this service.\nThe logs related to this service only contain the dynamic IP address from which the device connected to the service, and these logs are purged on a rolling 24-hour basis.\nBroadcom is not in a position to identify any individual end-user based on the information involved in this service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>To Whom Do We Disclose Your Information And Why?</strong>\n<br>Broadcom does not sell or share, within the meaning of the California Privacy Rights Act, your personal information.\nWe only disclose your information as described in this Policy.\nBroadcom processes your information for the purposes described

for your convenience.\nAny access to and use of such linked websites will cause you to leave the Site.\nThird party websites, even if potentially serving content co-branded by Broadcom, are not governed by this Policy, but instead are governed by their own privacy statements/policies.\nWe recommend that you check the privacy statements/policies of every third party website you visit before providing any Personal Data.\nWe do not control those third party websites and are not responsible for their content or their privacy policies.\nThus, we do not endorse or make any legal

on our website (\u201cSite\u201d) so that we can improve your experience for example by recognising you whenever you visit our Site, providing you personalized information, remembering your marketing and product preferences, and helping you obtain the right information.\nYou can find out more about cookies and similar technologies, how we use them, and how to control them below.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Cookies.</strong>\n</em> Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to your computer\u2019s hard drive through your web browsers for record-keeping purposes.\nSome cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site and service.\nCookies on this Site may be delivered in a first-party (set by our website) or third-party (set by another website) context.\nThere are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Session Cookies.</strong>\n</em> Session cookies exist only during an online session.\nThey disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer.\nWe use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you logged into the Site.\nThis allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Persistent Cookies.</strong>\n</em> Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer.\nWe use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about our users\u2019 activity.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.</strong>\n</em> Clear GIFS are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.\nIn contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer\u2019s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages.\nWe may use clear GIFs (a.k.a.\nweb beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage.\nWe and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in e-mails to our customers, to help us measure e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and determine whether our e-mails are forwarded.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Third Party Analytics.</strong>\n</em> We use third party automated devices and applications to evaluate usage of our Site.\nWe also may use other analytic means to help us improve our services, performance, and user experiences.\nThese applications may use cookies and other tracking technologies to provide their services to us.\nWe do not share your personal data except on an aggregated basis with these third parties.</p>&nbsp;How Do We Use Third-Party Ad Networks?<p>We use third parties such as network advertisers to display advertisements on our Sites, to assist us in displaying advertisements on third party websites, and to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns.\nThis enables us and these third parties to deliver ads for products and services in which you might be interested.\nThird party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you.\nWe may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Site and our services, as well as aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Site and users of our service.\nThese third party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party\u2019s specific privacy policy.</p>\n<p>If you are a visitor from a country where these cookies have been enabled, you may opt-out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative (\u201cNAI\u201d) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (\u201cDAA\u201d).</p>\n<p>Opting out of one or more NAI or DAA member networks (many of which will be the same) means that members of those networks will no longer deliver targeted content or ads to you.\nYou may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing.\nAlso, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective.\nFor more information regarding this practice by NAI and DAA members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to opt-out of
