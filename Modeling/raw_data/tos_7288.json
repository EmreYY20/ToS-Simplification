website traffic</li>\n<li>Providing information you request (e.g.\nnewsletter subscriptions, responses to support ticket)</li>\n</ul> b.\nCustomers (those who use the Chartbeat Product) <p> For Customers specifically, We collect and store Personal Data that Our Customers submit to Us, such as their names, job roles, e-mail addresses, and billing information, to allow Us to identify Customers, provide the Service and notify Customers of changes or updates to the Service.\n</p>\n<p> If a Customer elects to provide it, We also collect and store the Customer's phone number, which We use to assist Us in providing the Service, including to contact them in account recovery and other scenarios.\n</p>\n<p> We also collect other information from Customers, such as IP address and browser type.\nWe use the IP addresses of Customers to assist in login and other uses related to Customers' use of the Service.\nCustomers' sessions on Our Site are also tracked for systems administration purposes and to track user trends.\nWe may link IP address and other information to a Customer's account.\n</p>\n<p> We also collect Customers' user ID and password information to enable them to log into and use the Service.\n</p>\n<p> Finally, Customers will start receiving marketing emails from us when they register for the Service, as we believe it is of our common interest for the Customer to know more about our services and products.\nCustomers can opt-out of marketing emails by utilizing the unsubscribe links provided therein, but We may still need to send Customers e-mails relating to their accounts (e.g.\nsupport requests response, security warnings, updates to our Terms and Conditions), as strictly needed, so We can continue to provide our Services in accordance with our obligations to you.\n</p> c.\nCustomer Visitors (individuals who visit publisher's websites) <p> For Customer Visitors, when a Customer Visitor visits a Customer Website, We collect certain information regarding their use of the Customer Website, such as their IP address and browser type on behalf of our Customer.\nTheir session on the Customer Website will be tracked.\nWe may use their IP address to identify the general geographic area from which they are accessing the Customer Website.\nWe remove the last octet of the IP address and therefore do not store IP addresses or link IP addresses to any Personal Data.\nWe also use this information for systems administration purposes, abuse prevention and to track user trends in connection with Our provision of the Service.\n</p>\n<p> As part of the Service, We collect information relating to traffic on the Customer Websites (\"Traffic Data\") on which Customers choose to activate the Service.\nIn connection with the collection of this Traffic Data, Chartbeat does not collect any Personal Data from Customer Visitors, (i) so long as the Customer configures the Chartbeat code on the Customer Website in accordance with the instructions and documentation provided by Us, so that URLs containing Personal Data of Customer Visitors are not captured by the Service, and (ii) provided that We do collect IP addresses from Customer Visitors in order to show geolocation information but We remove the last octet of the IP address and therefore do not store IP addresses in a manner that would permit personal identification.\n</p>\n<p> Traffic Data is used to provide Customers with real-time analytics and uptime monitoring.\nWe may aggregate and anonymize Traffic Data with that from other sites to provide benchmarking data and other functionality, but We will not use or disclose aggregated Traffic Data in a manner that reveals the identity of a Customer or Customer Website without the Customer's express prior consent.\n</p>\n<p> We also collect first party cookie IDs on behalf of Customers.\nChartbeat code, by default, sets and reads a cookie on the Customer's website domain containing a randomly-generated user ID for purposes of determining unique visitor counts and visitors' loyalty to a site.\nSuch information can be classified as Personal Data under the European General Data Protection Regulation and any other applicable data protections legislations which Chartbeat may be subject to, including the Brazilian General Data Protection Law (Federal Law n.\n13,709/2018) (together, \u201cData Protection Laws\u201d), but it is not stored in a manner that would permit personal identification.\n</p>\n<p> We also collect and use browser header information to help Us understand from which websites a Customer Visitor navigates to a Customer Website.\n</p>\n<p> Our Customers are required to: (a) make appropriate disclosures using the Customer's privacy policy or via statements on the Customer's website(s).\nand (b) obtain all Customer Visitors' consent to the use of cookies, if applicable and when required by Data Protection Laws.\nChartbeat is not and shall not be liable for any collection or use of Personal Data of Customer Visitors due to a Customer's placement of the Chartbeat code on the Customer Website not in accordance with Chartbeat's instructions or documentation.\n</p>\n</ul> 4.\nOUR LEGAL BASIS FOR USE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA <p> We consider that the legal bases for using your Personal Data as set out in this Privacy Policy are as

protective than those set out in this policy.\n</p> c.\nBusiness Transfers <p> Chartbeat may choose to buy or sell assets.\nIn these types of transactions, information about Customers as well as aggregated and anonymized data is typically one of the business assets that is transferred.\nMoreover, if Chartbeat, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is reviewed and transferred or acquired by a third party.\nYou acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Chartbeat may continue to use your Personal Data as set forth in this Privacy Policy.\n</p> d.\nPublic authorities and compliance with law <p> Chartbeat may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to a lawful request by public authorities,

received from the European Union or Switzerland on its behalf processes that Personal Data in a manner which is inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles (unless Chartbeat can prove that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage).\n</p>\n</ul> 6.\nHOW LONG WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA <p> We keep your Personal Data for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which the Personal Data is processed.\nThe length of time for which We retain Personal Data depends on the purposes for which We collect and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws and to

irretrievably delete all personal data processed on behalf of Our Customers when it is no longer required to exercise or perform Our rights or obligations under Our Terms of Service.\n</p> 7.\nCHOICE, ACCESS AND YOUR RIGHTS <ul> a.\nYour Authorization Required <p> Whether you are a Chartbeat Site Visitor, a Customer or a Customer Visitor, We will not use or share your Personal Data other than as

of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) obligations and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Chartbeat wants our customers and users to know that we are committed to ensuring compliance and superior data protection.</p>\n<p>We have always held strict guidelines around consumer data privacy and data security.\nSince 2017, we have undergone an extensive data protection audit, appointed a data protection officer, and have been working to review and augment all of our data practices..\nEven though we have already achieved high levels of data security and protections, we continue to diligently work to enhance and improve our data privacy practices.</p>\n<p>Important: We wanted to provide this readiness summary as a plain English explanation of GDPR and the CCPA and our compliance efforts.<strong> This is not a legal document, nor is it meant to provide all legal terms related to our provision of the services to you.</strong> For legal terms, please see the relevant agreement between you and Chartbeat.</p> GDPR and CCPA compliance <p>The below FAQ addresses how Chartbeat is approaching GDPR and the CCPA, how our product works with regard to personal data, and what resources customers can access with respect to each.</p>\n<ul>\n<li> What is GDPR? <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European regulation adopted by the European Commission on data protection and privacy for the benefit of individuals located in the European Union.\nIn short, it provides comprehensive data privacy protection for the personal data of EU individuals, focusing on transparency, accountability and the rights of data subjects.</p> What is CCPA? <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a California law on data protection and privacy for the benefit of California consumers.</p>\n</li>\n<li> What is Chartbeat\u2019s approach to data? <p>One of the earliest decisions Chartbeat made as a business \u2014 and one which we've stuck to steadfastly over the years \u2014 is to build our products with user privacy as a top priority.</p>\n<p>In light of GDPR and CCPA, we continue to evaluate and improve all of our data security, privacy, storage and data handling procedures and practices.\nChartbeat does not sell any personal information.</p>\n<p>Beyond our product, Chartbeat continuously evaluates our data privacy and security practices around standard business operations (such as marketing, finance and sales) to ensure that we are GDPR- and CCPA-compliant now and in the future.</p>\n</li>\n<li> How can I learn more about Chartbeat\u2019s commitment to complying with data protection laws? <p>We will continue to enrich our data protection measures and communicate about them here on this site, and directly with our customers.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> How Chartbeat products use data <ul>\n<li> Does Chartbeat track personal data? <p>In terms of the data we collect on behalf of our customers, Chartbeat obtains but does not store user internet protocol (IP) addresses and certain other online identifiers which constitute \u201cPersonal Data\u201d and personal information under GDPR and CCPA\u2019s broad definition, respectively.</p>\n<p>Chartbeat\u2019s products are designed to provide full functionality to our customers without needing any identifying information about our customer\u2019s website visitors or consumers such as the name, email address or any similar information.\nWe do not collect or store such information.\nFurther, as a matter of data security and privacy, we also do not collect or store any sensitive or special categories of Personal Data or personal information.</p>\n</li>\n<li> What are IP addresses and why does Chartbeat obtain them? <p>Every computer and device connected to the Internet is assigned an Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) address.\nIP addresses, which need to be used by websites for the Internet to function, enable information to pass between computers and servers.</p>\n<p>Chartbeat uses IP addresses in order to provide our service.\nWhen visitors browse on websites using Chartbeat, Chartbeat code transmits information about what was read to our servers.\nThis communication between browser and server necessarily involves IP addresses, as all Internet communication does.\nWe use IP addresses to handle that data transmission.\nAfter receipt of this data, we strip identifying information from the IP addresses by masking the last octet, and use this masked IP address to identify the city and country in which a visitor is based.\nWe then delete masked IP addresses from our systems within two hours of receipt.\nWe do not use IP addresses in any other part of our system.</p>\n<p>In technical terms, this means that each IP\u2019s final octet is converted to 000 before being processed by Chartbeat's systems and is never written to disk.\nConversion to 000 prevents the address from being used to track back to an individual host.</p>\n</li>\n<li> Does Chartbeat set cookies? <p>\n<strong>Chartbeat does not set third-party cookies.</strong> We also do not take any steps to identify specific visitors (for example, we do not do browser fingerprinting or collect device IDs).</p>\n<p>There are two types of cookies: first-party cookies and third-party cookies.\nFirst-party cookies are controlled by website owners, and they are specific to that particular website.\nThird-party cookies, by contrast, are set by third parties and may be used to track visitors between domains.</p>\n<p>Chartbeat was designed with privacy in mind, and is a first-party analytics platform.\nThis means that publishers who use our service can set first-party cookies on their sites using Chartbeat code, or they can run in cookieless mode.\nHowever, Chartbeat does not, under any circumstances, set third-party cookies on our publisher\u2019s sites.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Customer Resources <ul>\n<li> Have the GDPR changes affected my Terms of Service with Chartbeat? <p>Yes.\nChartbeat\u2019s standard Terms of Service have been amended consistent with GDPR requirements and are located here.\nCustomers governed by our standard Terms of Service will be automatically served by our Data Processing Addendum (\"DPA\") after May 25, 2018.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we will have updated our Privacy Policy, and other related documentation.</p>\n</li>\n<li> Have the CCPA changes affected my Terms of Service with Chartbeat? <p>Yes.\nChartbeat\u2019s standard Terms of Service have been amended consistent with CCPA requirements and are located here.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we will have updated our Privacy Policy, and other related documentation.</p>\n</li>\n<li> How can I adjust the controls that I have over the data I share with Chartbeat? <p>Chartbeat customers have the ability to manage and adjust controls over data they share with Chartbeat.\nAdditionally, publishers can modify Chartbeat data settings, including running Chartbeat in cookieless mode.\nPlease note that the only way to enter cookieless mode is for a developer to change the way that Chartbeat's code is implemented across the entire domain.</p>\n<p>Refer to our documentation guide or contact support@chartbeat.com if you have specific requests.</p>\n</li>\n<li> Where can I learn more about Chartbeat\u2019s data security practices?
