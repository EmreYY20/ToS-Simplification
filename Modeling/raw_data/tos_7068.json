your information.\nWe understand that this is a big responsibility and we work hard to protect your information and put you in control.\nThis Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it and how you can update, manage, export and delete your information.\nLast update: July 8th, 2022.Information we collectWe collect information to run the service, prevent abuse, and to provide better products to all our users.Basic InformationTo register as a user with Morgen, you will be asked to sign in using your <strong>email address</strong>.\nYour email address will be used for identification purposes and is linked to your Morgen account across all devices where you use Morgen.\nWe also collect some information about these devices like <strong>the operating system</strong>,<strong>hardware and software versions</strong>,<strong>screen resolution</strong>,<strong>the name of your mobile operator or ISP (Internet Service Provider)</strong>, <strong>language</strong>, <strong>time zone</strong>,<strong>approximate location</strong>, and <strong>IP address</strong>.<strong>Calendar Metadata</strong>When you link an external calendar provider like Google Calendar, Microsoft Exchange, Office 365, iCloud or other CalDAV calendars, we collect the <strong>unique identifier</strong> and the <strong>email address or username</strong> of these accounts.\nBy default, password and access tokens are only stored locally and never leave your computer.\nIn other words, we cannot access your account remotely with the information that we collect.\nWhen available from the calendar provider, we collect the <strong>name</strong> and the <strong>company name</strong> of the user associated with the account.\nWe also collect <strong>general statistics</strong> like the number of calendars in one account or the total number of events and contacts in each calendar.\nFor some more advanced features, like enabling Shared availability and Scheduling Links, Morgen requires continuous access to your latest calendar status.\nIn this case, you will be prompted for consent, and we will collect the accounts' credentials, which will be stored in encrypted form in our data center.TasksTasks are hosted in the Morgen cloud service.\nWhen you create a task, all its properties, including title, priority and notes are stored in our backend.Usage LogsWe collect general information about how you use Morgen, such as the <strong>views</strong> you engage with, the<strong> features you use</strong>, the <strong>actions you take</strong>, and <strong>how frequently you use &nbsp;Morgen</strong>.\nFor example, we log when you're using and have last used Morgen, and how many times you create calendar events using the calendar interface or the calendar assistant.SurveysIf you fill research surveys within Morgen, we collect <strong>your answers to the questionnaires</strong>.\nNormally, the results of these surveys are anonymous and not linked to your Morgen profile.\nSometimes, the survey might ask you to leave your email address.\nIn this case, the survey is not anonymous and can be linked with your Morgen profile or your activities within Morgen.\nNote that the participation is always optional.Information that we <em>don't</em> collectMorgen runs primarily on your computer, processing some of your data locally without transferring this information to our servers whenever possible.Access credentials to third-party accounts (by default)By default, we do not transfer nor collect the passwords and access tokens of your calendar accounts.\nThese are stored locally on your computer and are used by Morgen to synchronize your calendar data.\nSome features, however, do require us to store your access credentials (\"Connect to Morgen Cloud\").\nIn this case, you will be asked for consent before such features are enabled.Calendar DataMorgen synchronizes locally the information related to your calendar events, including the name and email address of the people registered as attendees in such events.\nCalendar events are never transferred to our servers.\nWhen your calendars need to be queried in order to provide some of the Morgen functionalities, any calendar data is immediately deleted as soon as the operation is completed.How do we use your informationProvide, personalize and improve MorgenWe use the information we have to develop, test and improve Morgen, including conducting surveys and research, and running, testing and troubleshooting new features.Communicate with YouWe may use your email address to communicate with you about Morgen, let you know about changes to our policies and terms, ask your feedback, and timely report any possible security issue if found.\nWe also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.Integrity and SecurityWe use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the integrity of Morgen.\nFor example, we use data we have to investigate suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies.Sharing of informationWe do not sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will.\nWe also do not share your information with third-parties.\nHowever, the data we collect is stored and processed on cloud infrastructures provided by our partners (the <em>data processors</em> in GDPR terms).\nWe store all data in Switzerland or in the European Union.\nOur partners

example, we collect the calendar account credentials only if you decide to use a feature that requires it.\nSecond, we use safe protocols for communication and transferring data (such as HTTPS).\nCredentials are stored encrypted using RSA.\nWe use pseudonymising or anonymising where suitable, for example when we train Machine Learning models based on aggregated data.\nWe use 2-factor authentication, whenever available, to access our accounts on processing partners that host your information.\nWe monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks.\nEven though we try our best, we can not guarantee the total security of information.\nHowever, we promise to notify suitable authorities of data breaches.\nWe will also notify you if there is a threat to your rights or

used and under what circumstances such information may be disclosed.\nYou agree to review the Policy periodically so that you are aware of any modifications.\nWe will also inform you by email of such
