categorized as general information and personally identifiable information.</p>\n<p>\n<u>General information</u>\n<strong>.\n</strong>General information does not specifically identify you and may include, for example, information automatically provided to us by your browser or computer, such as your IP address, Internet service provider, the type of browser you are using, your operating system, the website you visited prior to and after this website, the webpages you visited on this website, your location information, and the date and time of your visit.\nWe automatically collect some general information from you indirectly each time you visit the Scholar\u2019s App Website and the webpages within the site.\nThis type of general information helps us determine, for example, your computer environment, the type of browser and version you are using and the pages you visit on the Scholar\u2019s App Website.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Personally identifiable information</u>\n<strong>\n</strong>is specific to you and identifies you individually.\nPersonally identifiable information includes information such as your name, date of birth, social security

to provide personally identifiable information and other information to enable the applicant\u2019s selected schools to identify the applicant and process the applicant\u2019s inquiry form and/or application for admission.\nAll personally identifiable information collected by us is voluntarily provided by you directly when you register for a Scholar\u2019s App account and user id and each time you complete a Scholar\u2019s App application, inquiry form, Supplement or other form on the Scholar\u2019s App Website.\nSome of the personally identifiable information requested is mandatory and must be provided by the registrant or applicant in order to complete the registration, inquiry or application process.\nAll other information is optional and should not impede the application process if omitted by the applicant.</p>\n<p>We may also collect personally identifiable information when you contact us via phone or email for technical support or other requests.\nBy voluntarily providing personally identifying information, you are consenting to our use of such information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>Our Policies Regarding Use and Disclosure of Information<p>\n<u>Use of

Service, general information is not used to identify individual users of the Scholar\u2019s App Website.\nWe use general information to analyze website usage loads and trends, to administer the

policies and practices described below.\nWe do not promise to retain your personally identifiable information or general information for any minimum period of time and we may delete all or some of your information at any time, with or without notice, without liability, in the event that you violate our Terms of Service or for any other reason in our sole and absolute discretion.\nWe may use your email address and/or other contact information to communicate with your from time to time about your Scholar\u2019s App application or the scholarships to which your application has been sent, to provide you with technical or other information about the Scholar\u2019s App Website or to respond to your inquiries and requests for customer service.\nThese communications are not promotional in nature.\nWe may also use aggregated (i.e., non-identifying) general and/or personally identifiable information for statistical and other purposes and we may share such aggregate information with our member scholarship committees and partners.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to Third Parties</u>.\nWe do not sell, lease, license, share or otherwise disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties, except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>In providing this service to you, we necessarily must share your Scholar\u2019s App

information.\nNote that we cannot and do not control the use and/or disclosure of your personally identifiable information by the scholarship committees to whom your Scholar\u2019s App application is submitted and we are not responsible for any use or misuse by those scholarship committees or any third party.\nOnce your Scholar\u2019s App application is submitted to a particular scholarship committee, the information on the application submitted to the scholarship committee cannot be changed through the Scholar\u2019s App Website.\nYou must contact the scholarship committee directly to change or correct a submitted application.</p>\n<p>We may disclose personally identifiable information to our independent contractors, service providers and/or vendors who assist us in performing internal business functions and/or provide other services necessary to the operation of our business and/or the Scholar\u2019s App Website.</p>\n<p>We may also disclose personally identifiable

manage enrollment in connection with educational or scholarship programs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The student agrees to share their profile information with colleges, universities, and scholarship programs.\nThis information will be used for recruitment, scholarship opportunities, and college planning outreach.</li>\n<li>These organizations must sign a license agreement, which outlines the specific terms for which the student information can be used before it must be destroyed.</li>\n<li>Under no circumstances are these organizations allowed to give the student information to other organizations.</li>\n<li>Scholar\u2019s App consistently monitors the use of student information by licensed organizations for compliance.</li>\n<li>Users can opt out of at any

bankruptcy, or receivership, if such information is transferred to one or more third parties as part of our business or assets.</p>Your Access to Personally Identifiable Information<p>You may correct or update your personally identifiable information at any time by accessing your Scholar\u2019s App application on the Scholar\u2019s App Website.\nHowever, the information on any applications submitted to a school prior to such corrections or updates will not be changed.\nTo make changes to an application already submitted, you must contact the school directly.\nTo avoid fraud, abuse and mistakes, we do not allow you to deactivate your application or close your account online.\nTo deactivate your Scholar\u2019s App application and/or close your account, you must send a signed, written request to our office address set forth below with your name, user id, the reason for your request and a telephone number by which we can reach you.\nWe will attempt to respond to each such request within a reasonable time after receipt.\nWe will retain archived copies of your account, Scholar\u2019s App application and personally identifiable information for our records, subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>Our Use of Cookies<p>A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from our server and stored on your computer\u2019s hard drive.\nWe use cookies for managing your online sessions while you are using the Scholar\u2019s App Website, to save you from having to repeatedly enter your user ID and password, and to secure your communications with the Scholar\u2019s App Website, when necessary.\nWe do not store personally identifiable information in cookies.</p>\n<p>You may choose to accept or reject cookies.\nBy modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies.\nIf you choose to reject cookies from the Scholar\u2019s App Website, you may not be able to use those parts of the website that require cookies.</p>Our Security Practices and Procedures<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information you submit to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.\nWhen you enter sensitive information on our webpages, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).\nWe use the same type of encrypted transmissions when providing your application information to your selected schools and when you provide your payment information to the school\u2019s chosen payment processor.\nWe also restrict physical and electronic assess to our servers through the use of perimeter security and industry-standard firewalls.\nHowever, be aware that any emails you send to or receive from us are inherently not secure.\nContact us by telephone if your question or comment involves sensitive personally identifiable information.</p>\n<p>In addition to encrypted transmissions and physical and electronic security, we require you to select a unique user ID and password when you register to use the Scholar\u2019s App Website.\nYou must enter your user ID and password each time you log in to the Scholar\u2019s App Website to access your account.\nIt is your responsibility to maintain the secrecy of your password and to change your password periodically.\nWe recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone in order to avoid unauthorized access to your account.\nEach time you are finished working in your account, you should logout of your account, close your browser window and clear the computer cache to avoid unauthorized access to your account.\nYou should contact us immediately if you believe your password or account has been compromised.</p>\n<p>No method of transmission over the Internet or data security scheme is 100% secure, however.\nTherefore, while we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.\nIf you have any questions about our security practices, you may contact us by any of the means described below.</p>Links to Other Websites<p>This website may contain links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by or affiliated with Scholar\u2019s App.\nWe are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.\nWe encourage you to

Scholar\u2019s App Website.</p>Notice of Modifications to This Privacy Policy<p>Scholar\u2019s App reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy from time-to-time as necessary to reflect changing circumstances, including, for example, changes in our information collection and/or usage practices.\nScholar\u2019s App will notify you of any modifications to this Privacy Policy by electronically posting the revised Privacy Policy on the Scholar\u2019s App Website.\nWe encourage you to review this Privacy Policy frequently in order to be aware of any changes in the way we collect, use and/or disclose your information.\nThe revised Privacy Policy will be effective as of the Effective Date displayed at the top and bottom of this document.\nYour continued use of the Scholar\u2019s App Website after the Effective Date of the revised Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.\nIn addition, Scholar\u2019s App may, but is not obligated to, notify you via e-mail and/or by other means of such modifications.</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "created_at": "2023-04-16 01:23:08.732909", "updated_at": "2023-04-16 01:23:34.608981"}, {"id": 15597, "name": "Security Information", "url": "https://scholarsapp.com/security", "xpath": "//body", "text": "Security Information<p>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) applies to \"covered entities\" and \"business associates.\" Covered entities include health care providers engaged in certain electronic transactions, health plans, and health care clearinghouses.\nBusiness associates are entities that provide services to a covered entity that involve access by the business associate to Protected Health Information (PHI), as well as entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on behalf of another business associate.\nHIPAA was expanded in 2009 by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act.\nHIPAA and HITECH establish a set of federal standards intended to protect the security and privacy of PHI.\nHIPAA and HITECH impose requirements related to the use and disclosure of PHI, appropriate safeguards to protect PHI, individual rights, and administrative responsibilities.<br> For additional information on HIPAA and HITECH, visit http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy.</p>General information<p>ScholarsApp uses Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Firebase to continually expand coverage against the most important global standards.\nAs such, ScholarsApp provides industry recognized certifications and audits such as the ISO 27001 and SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3 evaluation process.</p>Encryption and protection of PHI in Scholar\u2019s App<p>All Scholar\u2019s App network traffic, whether it contains PHI or not, is encrypted using industry-standard transport encryption (TLS).\nTransport Layer Security (TLS) is a protocol that ensures privacy between communicating applications and their users on the Internet.\nWhen a server and client communicate, TLS 1.2 and 1.3 protocols ensure that no third party may eavesdrop or tamper with any message.\nTLS is the successor to the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).\nSSLv2, SSLv3, TLS 1.0, and TLS 1.1 are no longer considered secure protocols and thus are not used or supported by Scholar\u2019s App.</p>\n<p>Scholar\u2019s App technical implementation includes full access controls to make sure that only authorized individuals are able to access PHI related information and those individuals are trained on the requirements of HIPAA.\nWe follow cybersecurity best practices such as setting strong passwords, limiting administrative privileges, and regularly scan for malware.</p>Auditing, backups, and disaster recovery<p>To be consistent with HIPAA and HITECH requirements, Scholar\u2019s App has put auditing capabilities in place to allow security analysts to examine detailed activity logs or reports to see who had access, IP address entry, what data was accessed, etc.\nThis data is tracked, logged, and stored in a central location for extended periods of time.</p>\n<p>Under HIPAA, covered entities must have a contingency plan to protect data in case of an emergency and must create and maintain retrievable exact copies of electronic PHI.\nTo implement a data back-up plan, Scholar\u2019s App uses persistent storage for its server instances.\nThese volumes offer off-instance storage that persists independently from the life of a server instance.\nTo align with HIPAA guidelines, Scholar\u2019s App creates point-in-time snapshots of its volumes that automatically are replicated.\nThese snapshots can be accessed at any time and can protect data for long-term durability.\nScholar\u2019s App implements a variety of disaster recovery mechanisms.</p>\n<p>Scholar\u2019s App administrators can start server instances very quickly and can use an Elastic IP address (a static IP address for the cloud computing environment) for graceful failover from one machine to another.</p>How can you contact us about this policy?<p>If you have any questions or comments about this policy, you may contact our technical support by email at

funds.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Scholar\u2019s App will arrange for funds to be handled by PayPal via it\u2019s crowdfunding account services.\nScholar\u2019s App does not directly handle any funds.\nPledged funds are released to the applicant\u2019s corresponding school as soon as the applicant is accepted and enrolls at the school.\nScholar\u2019s App is thus not in control of funds and cannot offer it\u2019s own refunds, but in very limited circumstances, in its absolute and sole discretion, may try to assist in the recovery of pledged funds (but makes no guarantees even under such
