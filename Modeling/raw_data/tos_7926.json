order to allow you to benefit from the Site and/or Service functionalities.\nIf you have any hesitation about providing such personal data to us or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and in our Terms of Use, you should not become a Publisher.</p> The Site and Third Party Sites <p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to the Site.\nThe Site may contain links to third parties' sites which are not owned or controlled by the Provider.\nThe Provider has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies (if any), or practices of any third parties' sites.\nYou acknowledge that you are responsible for reviewing and understanding the privacy policies (if any) of any third parties' sites you may access through this Site.\nBy using this Site, you release the Provider from any and all liability arising from your use of any third parties' sites to which this Site may link.</p>\n<p>Our primary goals in collecting your personal data are to provide and improve the Site and Service and the related features, to administer your subscription and to enable Publishers to enjoy and easily navigate the Site and Service.\nBelow are the types and categories of information we collect.</p> Personal Data Collected <p>We collect your personal data in the following ways:</p> Sign-up <p>To use the Service you are required to provide the following information, which you recognize and expressly acknowledge are personal data allowing others, including the Provider, to identify you: first and last name, full address e-mail address, You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of any personal information you submit.\nInaccurate information will affect the information you receive when using the Site and Service and our ability to contact you as described in this Privacy Policy.</p> Log Data <p>When you visit the Site our servers automatically record information about your use and your visit to the Site (\"Log Data\").\nThe Log Data may include information such as your computer Internet Protocol (IP) address, time and date of your requests, your browser type, what software you were using, the web page you were visiting immediately prior to visiting the Site, access times and dates, your location, mobile network information and other statistics.\nWe use this information to monitor and analyze the use of the Site and for the Site's technical administration, to improve the Site's functionalities and Publisher-friendliness, and to better tailor it to the Publishers' needs.</p> Cookies <p>Like most sites, we use cookies and web log files to track the use of the Site.\nA cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer and allows the Provider to recognize you as a Publisher when you return to the Site using the same computer and web browser.\nIf your browser settings do not allow cookies, you may not be able to use the Site.\nLike the information you enter at subscription, cookies and log file data are used to customize your experience on the Site.</p>\n<p>One type of cookie, known as a \"session\" cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the Site.\nSession cookie expires after a short time or when you close your web browser.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the Site may use local shared objects, commonly called a \"flash cookies\" for purposes such as storing Publishers\u2019 preferences.\nYou may manage or opt out of your flash cookies here.</p>\n<p>In the course of serving advertisements or optimizing Service to our Publishers, we may allow authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.\nAny information provided to third parties through such cookies will not be personally identifiable.\nIf you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by third parties, please click here.\nMost browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.\nUnfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies or you opt to refuse all cookies, you may not be able to use the Site.\nThe Provider does not store personal data in the cookies.</p> Web Beacons <p>We allow other companies, called ad networks, to serve advertisements to Publishers through the Site.\nAd networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms.</p>\n<p>To deliver these ads properly, we may include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by the Provider so the ad networks may provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit other sites.</p>\n<p>Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network\u2019s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.</p>\n<p>These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other sites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads.\nThe Provider does not provide personal data to any advertiser or any other third parties.</p> Log files, IP and Information About Your Computer <p>Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the Site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave the Site.\nWe also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, e-mail patterns, as well as the name of your ISP.\nThis information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the Site.\nThe linkage between your IP address and your personal data is not shared with third parties without your prior consent or except when allowed or required by law.</p> Communications <p>The Provider will communicate with you through e-mail and notices posted on the Site or through other means available through the service, including text and other forms of messaging.\nIf we send any communications to you via the carrier service with which you have a mobile communications subscription or otherwise have access, you understand you will pay

provide your personal data to third parties for marketing purposes.\nWe will only share your personal data with third parties to carry out your instructions or to provide specific services or information.\nUnless you have agreed to it, these third parties do not retain, share, or store any personal data except to provide these services and they are bound by confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information.</p>\n<p>We may provide aggregated anonymous data about the use of the Site to third parties for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate, including to prospective advertisers on the Site.</p> Teaming with Third Parties <p>The Provider allows other companies to place advertisements on the Site.\nThese companies use technology to deliver advertisements you see on the Site directly to your browser.\nIn doing so, they may automatically receive your IP address.\nOther companies that place advertising on the Site may have the ability to use cookies and/or web beacons to collect information, including information about your use of the Site.\nWe do not control the processes that advertisers use to collect the information.\nHowever, IP addresses, cookies and web beacons alone are not considered as personal data and generally cannot be used to identify individuals, only machines.\nTherefore, advertisers and others whose advertisements or content may appear on the Site generally will not know who you are, unless you provide additional information to them, by responding to an advertisement, by entering into an agreement with them, or by some other means.</p> Legal Disclaimer <p>The Provider cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the

information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.\n\"European Territories\" mean the European Economic Area and Switzerland.\nFor the purpose of this Privacy Notice, the term \"European Territories\" shall continue to include the United Kingdom, even after the United Kingdom leaves the European Economic Area following Brexit.</p>\n<p>However, we will normally collect

collection and sharing of personal data to enable our services, it is the responsibility of these parties to provide necessary privacy notices and obtain required consent(s).</p>\n<p>If you have

interests to process your data are balanced against your data protection rights and freedoms, then please contact us using the Contact Form</p> Disclosures to Others <p>The Provider may also disclose

to visit an advertiser by clicking on a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to those third parties' websites.\nThe fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices.\nWe do not exercise control over third parties' websites.\nThese other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer,
