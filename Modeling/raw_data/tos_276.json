empowered but also respected.\nIt\u2019s up to all of us to make that happen.\nThis page includes important information about our rules and guidelines related to your use of SoundCloud.\nPlease take the time to carefully read through this information.\nwe take these guidelines seriously and expect you to do the same.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;The examples in the below sections are for illustrative purposes and are not exhaustive.\nSoundCloud reserves the right to remove any content deemed to violate our Terms of Use at our discretion.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;h2 id=\"copyright\"&gt;Copyright&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;We have always set out to build a diverse, collaborative community where the rights of creators are respected.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;You are responsible for all activity associated with your account, including all content that you post.\nIf you post content that belongs to someone else (for example, if you are a distributor, promotional agency, manager, or radio plugger acting on behalf of an artist or label), or if you use someone else\u2019s content in a remix or other similar work, it is your responsibility to ensure that you have the permission of all relevant rightsholders in order to post that content to SoundCloud.\nAnyone uploading another person\u2019s content without the necessary permissions is liable to have that content removed and/or their account terminated.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;When reporting content for infringement, we consider reports abusive if you are not the rightsholder or an authorized agent thereof (like the rightsholder\u2019s attorney or manager).\nAbusive reporting may result in your civil liability for damages incurred by SoundCloud (including costs and legal fees), the person whose content you report, or any copyright owner or authorized licensee as a result of content being removed.\nAdditionally, you risk having your account frozen or, in some cases, terminated if we believe that you have abusively reported content.\nIf you do not own the copyright in the content, please do not report it for infringement.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;If you are unsure whether you can upload something, read our &lt;a href=\"/pages/copyright\"&gt;copyright information pages&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you feel that someone is infringing your copyright, &lt;a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/pages/copyright/report/form\"&gt;tell us about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;h2 id=\"enforcement-guidelines\"&gt;Enforcement guidelines&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;SoundCloud gives people from all over the world the power to share and connect through music and audio and is the only global community where you can connect one on one with fellow fans, the biggest names in music and emerging artists.\nWhile engaging with the community can be rewarding, it can also be a source of frustration and misunderstanding if the context of the content is not considered or understood or users don\u2019t communicate and interact in a respectful way.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;As a general rule we\u2019re unable to prescreen or proactively search for many kinds of content, but we aim to be fair in deciding what content is permitted on SoundCloud.\nWhile complaints and inquiries must be evaluated and addressed on a case-by-case basis, we aim to apply a uniform set of standards to every user.\nWhen determining whether to remove content, we ask ourselves a number of questions, such as:&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Is the behavior directed at an individual, group, or protected category of people?&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Clearly targeted content will increase likelihood of removal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Has the report been filed by the target of the abuse or a third party?&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;In some instances we may not be able to take reports from third parties.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Does the reported user have a history of violating our policies?&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;If a user has violated our Terms of Use in the past, this could impact the decision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;How severe is the violation?&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;The severity will be reflected in the respective action (i.e.\nwarning vs.\nsuspension).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Is the content of legitimate public interest?&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;The purpose of content will be considered.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;When you see content that upsets or shocks you, step back and consider the above in addition to the possible context and intention of the person sharing the content.\nIf you\u2019re unsure of a user\u2019s intentions, feel free to engage with them in a calm and level-headed manner.\nThe comments section on SoundCloud provides a unique environment for people to engage in a conversation around the content.\nAlternatively, you could message the user privately to share any concerns.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, it\u2019s always possible to block or ignore a user as a means to no longer see unwanted content on SoundCloud, and sometimes this is the best or only way to resolve these issues.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;Please consider the above and review the relevant section of our Community Guidelines below before reporting content to our Trust and Safety Team.\nThis will both align your expectations with our policy and allow our team to focus on removing content that truly doesn\u2019t have a place on SoundCloud.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;h2 id=\"criticism\"&gt;Criticism&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;Criticism should always focus on the content, and not on the individual who created it.\nWe do not want criticism of the personal character of the creator, only the criticism of their content.\nPlease share your opinion with others, but do so in a constructive way.\nBefore posting feedback, always ask yourself whether you would appreciate receiving the same feedback.\nIf not, don\u2019t post it.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;\u201cThis wasn't my favorite track of yours\u201d&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;\u201cI think different vocals on this track would work better\u201d&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;\u201cI\u2019m pretty disappointed with this track tbh\u201d&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;\u201cYou\u2019re a piece of s**t! No one\u2019s ever gonna listen to your garbage!\u201d&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;\u201cI hate you and your voice.\nYou should stop making music.\nYou\u2019re so annoying and we all hate you bro\u201d&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;\u201cWhat the hell is this!?\u201d&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;h2 id=\"abuse\"&gt;Abuse&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;We have zero tolerance for abusive or threatening behavior within the community and on the platform.\nWe consider abuse to be any activity where the intent or likely result is to attack or demean someone else.\nThis includes but is not limited to content aimed at sexualizing or degrading other users.\nAnyone found to be engaging in this type of activity risks the immediate, permanent termination of their account.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;\u201cI like this track! Thanks for this!\u201d&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Block a user who you do not wish to engage with.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;\u201cYou\u2019re the GOAT!\u201d&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;\u201cF**k you\u201d&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;\u201cI\u2019ll find u and hurt u where u at man u don\u2019t deserve to live\u201d&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;\u201cYou don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re talking about, idiot!\u201d&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;h2 id=\"harassment\"&gt;Harassment&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;We define harassment as the unwanted, continued pursuit of contact with an individual who has indicated they do not wish to be in contact with another individual.\nThe difference between abuse and harassment is that harassment is typically conducted over a sustained period of time, whereas abuse may be a one-off event.\nTherefore, if an individual is sending repeated unwanted messages or comments to another user, they risk the immediate, permanent termination of their account.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Message or comment once: \u201cHey, you should check out my music, I think you\u2019d like it\u201d&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Repeatedly message or comment: \u201chey I think you\u2019re beautiful talk to me!\u201d&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Engage with someone when they\u2019ve told you to stop, or use SoundCloud to contact someone when they\u2019ve blocked you on another platform.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Create accounts or content with the sole purpose of \u201cexposing\u201d the behavior of a single identifiable individual or group of individuals.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;h2 id=\"unauthorized-recording-or-publishing-of-private-information\"&gt;Unauthorized recording or publishing of private information&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;We do not allow the sharing of personal details of another person (or entity), without their permission.\nThis includes recordings of private conversations, full names, photographs, unlisted phone numbers, and home or email addresses.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Reference a person by their first name without them being identifiable.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Express thoughts without any direct references to another person.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Include personal details such as \u201cSarah Smith at Elmwood High School\u201d&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Use photos of other individuals without their consent.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Upload recordings of private phone calls between two individuals without consent.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Use screenshots of private conversations as profile/track/playlist artwork.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;h2 id=\"impersonation--misleading-metadata\"&gt;Impersonation &amp;amp.\nmisleading metadata&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;As a platform built with creator needs in mind, we welcome the use of stage names or professional identities on SoundCloud.\nHowever, you cannot impersonate another person or post content that is intentionally misleading.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;This means that you must not create profiles or post content that is intended to make people think you are someone else.\nYou must not use someone else\u2019s name or trademark without their permission, or pretend to be associated with someone you aren\u2019t, even if you feel that you are helping that person by doing so.\nThis applies to everyone from the most popular creators to casual users on SoundCloud.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Use tags to indicate similarities to artists that inspire you.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Use your own name as a display name or URL where this is also the name of an existing artist and no \u2122 infringement is taking place.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Use your own original artwork on your profile.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Mention artists that inspire you in your profile bio (i.e.\n\u201cX, Y and Z artist inspire me\u201d)&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Create fan accounts with the permission or endorsement of the artist in question.\nThese must be clearly distinguished from official profiles.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Upload tracks with an artist\u2019s name in the title who is not officially associated with it.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Use another artist\u2019s name or variation of an artist\u2019s name as your display name, URL or Track URL.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Use an image of an artist or images associated with an artist (album covers etc.) as an avatar, banner, track or playlist image where the artist is not officially associated with the account or track.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;List artist names in your bio as a means of attempting to game our search.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Create fan accounts without the permission of the artist in question.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;h2 id=\"pornographic-content\"&gt;Pornographic Content&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;We do not allow any content that is predominantly sexual in nature or that could be perceived as an aid to sexual gratification.\nThis includes, but is not limited to, images containing nudity and recordings or detailed descriptions of sexual acts, or links to pornographic sites.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Post ASMR of your dog eating treats, or you brushing your hair.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Post noises directly associated with sexual acts disguised as ASMR.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Link to any pornographic content in your profile bio.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;h2 id=\"violence-and-threatening-behavior\"&gt;Violence and threatening behavior&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;We do not allow any use of intimidation or threats of violence between our users, against the wider public or against SoundCloud employees.\nLikewise, we don\u2019t permit any incitement to, or glorification of, violent acts either against an individual or the wider public.\nAdditionally, the use of excessive gore in regards to both imagery or language is not permitted.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Provide commentary on violence in regards to a specific event (i.e.\nsomething that happened to you in the context of a podcast episode).&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Refer to violence where this serves an educational purpose.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Upload content that has the intention to intimidate an individual into fearing a physical attack against their person.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Upload content inciting violence (i.e.\ncalling on or encouraging others to complete violent acts against an individual or against the wider public).&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Upload graphic images of real or dramatized violence with the intent to glorify violent acts or to shock/disgust.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;h2 id=\"hate-speech\"&gt;Hate speech&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;SoundCloud allows for the presentation of individual beliefs and opinions.\nWe do not, however, allow content that promotes or encourages hatred, discrimination or violence against others based on race, cultural identity or ethnic background, religious beliefs, disability, gender identity, or sexual orientation.\nWe will use our discretion when necessary to determine if beliefs or opinions incite hatred.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;Please keep in mind that applicable laws state that Nazi and ISIS content is illegal, and will be removed without discussion, unless clearly used for educational or journalistic purposes.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Speak about a hate group in a purely educational manner, making it clear when you are quoting directly and not presenting them as your own views.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Specifically state that you do not endorse the groups/events/etc.\nthat you may be quoting.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;\u201cI mean, these [protected group], they know what\u2019s wrong with them\u201d&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;\u201c[protected group] are threatening us.\nWe need to get them out\u201d&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;h2 id=\"podcasts\"&gt;Podcasts&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;We understand that SoundCloud is a popular platform to host podcasts, and we welcome those who chose to use our platform for that reason.\nWe invite the discussion and expression of our users opinions on almost all given topics.\nWith that being said, we reserve the right to decide when those discussions, expressions and opinions are aimed at harming a group of individuals, or when they cross over into hate speech or abuse.\nIn these instances, users risk deletion of certain episodes or suspension of their account.\nWe also do not allow podcasts associated with any illegal or hate groups, even when the content itself does not violate our Terms of Use.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Host a podcast about your favorite foods.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Host a historical podcast.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Dedicate your entire podcast or a section of your podcast to \u201cissues with\u201d or reasons you dislike a protected group.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Host a podcast to share a revisionist view of the holocaust.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;h2 id=\"misinformationfake-news\"&gt;Misinformation/Fake News&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;As a platform that promotes freedom of speech and connects millions of people, we feel we have a responsibility to take a clear stance on the issues of fake news and misinformation.\nAlthough not a new concept, the digital age has made it easier than ever to spread information almost anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;With that being said, we understand that in today\u2019s day and age many people rely on the internet and social platforms as their main news source.\nTherefore, in order to maintain the trust and safety of our community, the deliberate use of false information in order to mislead users is something we do not condone.\nThis type of information can take many forms, but is often uploaded with the aim of affecting political discourse.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;We encourage you to ensure the accuracy of your content, as each user is responsible for what they upload.\nAny user found to be purposely sharing information that is fabricated or misleading may be deemed in violation of our Terms of Use and subject to the immediate, permanent termination of their account.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Use imaginative subjects to produce satire, comedy and entertainment content.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;State the sources of information shared when presenting content as news.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Use of clickbait titles, profile names and description.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Fabricate content that deliberately presents false or misleading claims as news.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Refer to violent events as \u201cfalse flags\u201d&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Post links to websites hosting \u2018fake news\u2019 articles or false information.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;h2 id=\"spammy-behavior-and-self-promotion\"&gt;Spammy behavior and self promotion&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;SoundCloud aims to help creators to connect directly with their fans and build their audience.\nWe understand that promoting your work is important, and we encourage you to seek out fans and other like-minded individuals.\nIn our experience, the most successful forms of promotion are built upon meaningful interactions between creators and their audience.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;However, there is a fine line between developing these connections and over-sharing with members of the community.\nTo help encourage a two-way relationship between creators and fans, we have technical restrictions in place to limit activity that goes against this principle.\nFurther, we aim for SoundCloud to be a spam-free zone.\nTo support this effort, we have policies in place that prohibit both spammy activity and the use of related services that violate our Terms of Use.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;Specifically, it is not possible to:&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Post identical or almost identical comments or messages in large volumes&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Repeatedly follow large volumes of accounts in a short period of time&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Repeatedly unfollow and refollow the same accounts, in order to draw attention to your own profile&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Repeatedly repost or like tracks that you have reposted or liked in the past&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Reach out to fans with tailored messages for each one of them.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Find users related to your content and interact with them.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Repost tracks similar to your own to attract traffic.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Copy and paste the same links and words in comments and/or private chat.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Randomly bulk follow a large amount of users.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Pay for external promotion services not affiliated with SoundCloud.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Creation, use or promotion of services that claim to boost a profile\u2019s popularity such as followers, plays, likes, or reposts.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Creation, use or promotion of services that sell social interactions or other forms of promotion on SoundCloud.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Create multiple accounts with the intention of inflating the popularity of other profiles.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;h2 id=\"reporting-violations\"&gt;Reporting violations&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;We aim to create and foster a community where our users\u2019 behavior is in line with these guidelines and where individuals hold each other accountable for their use of the platform.\nWhen this fails, we also have various measures in place to help us keep track of certain kinds of content that violate our Terms of Use.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;As a general rule we\u2019re unable to prescreen or proactively search for many kinds of content.\nAs such, it\u2019s possible you might come across content that you don\u2019t wish to see.\nIn these cases, please ignore such content and block those who share it to avoid it in the future.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;That said, if you encounter any content that clearly violates these guidelines or our Terms of Use or is otherwise illegal \u2013 including impersonation, abusive or threatening behavior, pornography or malicious speech \u2013 please report this.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;Our Trust and Safety Team will review all reports objectively, and remove any content that violates our Terms of Use, these guidelines or applicable law.\nTo report content

in mind that something you find unacceptable, may not be a violation of our Terms of Use or illegal.\nWe try to maintain a fair and balanced approach, but reporting content will not always result in that content being removed if it does not violate our guidelines, Terms of Use or applicable law.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;h2 id=\"termination-of-accounts\"&gt;Termination of accounts&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;If we

social plugins on our website by the blue button with the Facebook logo and the inscription \"Register with Facebook\" or \"Connect with Facebook\" or \"Log in with Facebook\" or \"Sign in with Facebook\".\nWhen you visit a page of our website that contains a social plugin, your browser makes a direct connection to the Facebook servers.\nThe content of the plugin is transferred from Facebook directly to your browser, which then embeds it into the website.\nThrough the integrated plugin, Facebook receives the information that your browser has accessed the corresponding page of our website, even if you do not have a Facebook profile or are not currently logged in to Facebook.\nThis information (including your IP address) is transmitted by your browser directly to a Facebook server in the US and stored there.\nThese data processing operations are carried out on the basis of Facebook's legitimate interest in the displaying of personalized advertising on the basis of browsing behavior.\nBy using the \"Facebook Connect\" button on our website, you can also log in or register on our website using your Facebook user data.\nDepending on your personal data protection settings on Facebook, we will only receive general information that is publicly accessible and stored in your profile when you use Facebook\u2019s \"Facebook Connect\" button if you give your express consent prior to the registration process on the basis of a corresponding notification on the exchange of data with Facebook.\nThis information includes your user ID, name, profile picture, age and

our Platform.\nThis especially applies to your likes and/or usage, listening and viewing behavior as well as your friends within Facebook.\nIn case you decide to share this information with us, we will display relevant artists, playlists and such to you for your liking.\nWe will store and process the personal data transmitted by Facebook to create a user account with the necessary personal data, provided you have approved this on Facebook.\nConversely, based on your consent, personal data (e.g.\non your surfing or purchasing behavior) may be transferred from us to your Facebook profile.\nPlease see Facebook's privacy policies for the purpose and scope of data collection and the further processing and use of data by Facebook, as well as your rights and settings options for protecting your privacy.\nIf you do not wish Facebook to associate any data collected via our website with your Facebook profile, you should log out of Facebook before you visit our website.\nYou can

Android\u2019s Advertising ID (\u201cAAID\u201d).\nYou can reset these numbers through the settings of your device\u2019s operating system (we do not control this).\nSuch identifiers will only be used for further analysis subject to your consent.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Apple IDs</strong> - We collect your Apple Identifier for Advertising (\u201cIDFA\u201d).\nYou can reset these numbers

collected from our app with user or device data collected from other companies\u2019 apps, websites, or offline properties for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes.\nTracking also refers to sharing user or device data with data brokers.\nThe use of such tracking is subject to your consent and therefore may only be exercised by us with such consent.\nApple allows the ID for Vendors (IDFV) to be used for analytics across apps from the same content provider (us).\nThe IDFV may not be combined with other data to track a user across apps and websites owned by other companies unless we have been granted permission to track by you.\nFor further information on how we use the SKAdNetwork for attribution tracking please refer to the documentation that Apple provides here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Payment Verification Information</strong> - We use the services of Adyen (Adyen N.V., Simon Carmiggeltstraat 6-50, 1011 DJ, Netherlands, click here for privacy

the sending of timed messages to you, such as emails containing invoices or notifications concerning your payment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>External Payment Providers</strong> - The payment provider you use for your payment is solely responsible for the payment.\nPlease refer to the terms of service and privacy policy of your payment provider for further

interact with the Platform (e.g.\nby listening, liking or creating playlists), as well as device information and general location data.\nWe may also display ads based on the page you\u2019re on or Materials you have recently viewed, searched, or listened to.\nThis allows us to show you ads that will likely be more relevant and interesting to you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To collect certain personal data such as cookie data and device information, if we engage with third party services such as ad-networks and exchanges that enable us to show you targeted ads.\nThat personal data is used to sync

with future effect.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Market Research Studies</strong> - Based on our legitimate interest, from time to time we will ask you to participate in market research studies and surveys or to do research studies based on anonymized and/or pseudonymized data.\nThere is no obligation to participate in our studies.\nIn the case that you do participate, it will be based on the consent you provide when answering the survey.\nWe deem that the use of anonymized and/or pseudonymized data is covered by our legitimate interest as we will only use such analysis to further improve our research and Platform for the benefit of understanding your needs and enhancing your experience.\nWe will only use the data you provide when answering the market study for other reasons, such as customized product recommendations or notifications based on your consent which you provide ahead of your participation in the market study.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Operate and

by us.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Through Your Profile</strong> \u2013 Any personal data in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public Tracks, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages.\nArtist profile owners will be able to see in their statistics that you have listened to the Tracks they uploaded along with a ranking of who listened to their Tracks the most.\nThey will also be able to see how many times you have listened to any of their Tracks, and that you are following them.\nThis is to allow creators to track the popularity of their Tracks.\nSimilarly, if you comment on any Tracks on the Platform, your comments will be available to all users of the Platform together with your profile name and picture.\nMore information is available in the SoundCloud Fan Insights document here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Service Providers</strong> \u2013 We use a variety of service providers, some of who may be located outside of the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), to provide services to us or to our users on our behalf.\nThese service providers have access to your personal data solely to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are contractually bound to implement appropriate organizational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorized disclosure of personal data, and only to process personal data in accordance with our instructions and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.\nWe need to share your personal data in order to ensure the adequate performance of our contract with you.\nFor instance, we work closely with service providers in the area of customer service (i.e.\nhelp center, content moderation), with technical service providers (e.g.\nrunning computer centers) or music service providers (i.e.\nrights administration) and payment service providers.\nThese service providers may generally only process your personal data on our behalf under special conditions.\nWhen using such service providers, we guarantee an adequate level of data protection and will use any contractual and actual safeguards to comply with respective regulations (like the GDPR, Standard Contractual Clauses or the CCPA).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Rightsholders</strong> - The Platform allows you to listen to a variety of Tracks, including licensed streaming content.\nWe share personal data with rightsholders that license Tracks to us to help them understand how the Tracks that they provide are performing, including insights about general or individual user listening trends and preferences.\nthis can possibly include your public profile details as well as basic usage data (for example interactions with Tracks).\nWe share this personal data based on our legitimate interest, as our contracts with these rightsholders state that they will be granted these insights.\nTheir interest prevails over your legitimate interest in the safekeeping of your public profile information and basic usage data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Collecting Societies</strong> - Due to legal obligations, we are obliged in many countries around the world to transmit pseudonymized or anonymized usage data to collecting societies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Advertising</strong> \u2013 We share the personal data collected about you, in hashed, aggregated, or de-identified forms with advertisers and advertising service providers and business partners in order to serve ads based on interests of respective segments and to measure the reach and effectiveness of those ads, including whether a user took an action(e.g.\npurchased a product).\nWe may also share cookie data and device identifiers with service providers for data matching purposes, in order to improve ad targeting.\nYou can find a detailed overview of our advertisers here.Please be aware that where such personal data of yours is identifiable, we will only use it with your consent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Social Media</strong> \u2013 For users outside of the EU/EEA and where permissible under applicable law we may share your email address (in hashed form, so that it does not identify you) with Facebook in order to target you with ads for SoundCloud products on Facebook and on third party websites and applications in the Meta Audience Network.\nFor users within the EU/EEA this is only permissible with your explicit consent.\nWe also allow Facebook and other social media platforms to collect personal data through cookies and similar technologies like pixels in order to serve ads for SoundCloud on those third party websites and apps and drive users to our Platform.\nIn order to measure the effectiveness of and optimize these marketing campaigns, these technologies track activity taken across devices after a user sees a SoundCloud ad, in order to determine performance metrics like sign ups, visits to the Platform, and purchases.\nAny questions regarding how these social media platform service providers process your personal data should be directed to them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Aggregated Data</strong> \u2013 We may also share aggregated and anonymized personal data (personal data about our users that we render in such a way that it no longer identifies or references an individual user) and other pseudonymized personal data for regulatory compliance, industry and market analysis, demographic profiling, marketing and advertising, and other business purposes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>API Integrations</strong> \u2013 SoundCloud has an open application-programming interface (API), which enables application developers to integrate elements of the Platform into other apps.\nSome of these developers may be located outside of the EEA but will always, if user data is concerned, sign a Data Processing Addendum and accordingly (where applicable) EU-US Standard Contract Clauses.\nAny personal data you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile information and any public Tracks, may be accessible to these developers, subject to our API Terms of Use.\nPlease bear this in mind when deciding what information to publish on your profile.\nFor information on how to limit the information that is available through the API, please see the Your Choices and Controls section below.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Party Applications</strong> \u2013 If you choose to connect your SoundCloud account to other apps or social networks such as Facebook, you may be sharing certain personal data with these apps or networks.\nMaterials that you share with social media networks will appear on your timeline (or similar functions) as well as in news feeds that may be viewed by the public or by certain followers, subject to the terms and conditions of such social media networks.\nIn the case of connected apps, you will need to provide the app developer with full access to your SoundCloud account in order to upload and download Tracks, or comment on, favorite, or repost Tracks from within the app.\nThis means sharing your public information, plus access to your private Tracks.\nSoundCloud is not responsible for these other apps or networks, so please make sure you only connect your account with apps or services that you trust.\nFor information on how to control the personal data that you share, and how to disconnect your account from these apps, please see the Your Choices and Controls section below.\nIf you do not want this information shared with such social media networks or other Third Party Applications, please change your SoundCloud Settings on our Platform or in those networks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Use of Your Name and Other User Identifiers in Sharing Links</strong> - When sharing personal data from our platform on other platforms, especially social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram, we may use your pseudonymized data.\nIf a user clicks on your shared link and is lead to our platform, the user will be presented with a banner telling the user that you (in this context, your profile name will be displayed) are using SoundCloud and/or that you shared this link, and the user will then be asked if they want to follow you.\nSuch use by us is considered a legitimate interest as it enriches our user experience and the way our users connect with each other.\nAs we assume that you share links responsibly with people whom you want to interact with, we also assume that your interest in the safekeeping of your personal data is not affected, especially since we only use pseudonymized data within the link itself.\nPlease be aware that your shared link may be shared further by other parties.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Compliance with Laws</strong> \u2013 We may disclose your personal data to courts, law enforcement agencies, and governmental authorities (i) to comply with our legal obligations, (ii) to comply with legal process and to respond to claims asserted against SoundCloud, (iii) to respond to verified requests relating to a criminal investigation or alleged or suspected illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other of our users to legal liability, (iv) to enforce and administer our Terms of Use and other agreements with users, or (v) to protect the rights, property or personal safety of SoundCloud, its employees, and members of the public.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Protecting our Rights</strong> \u2013 We may disclose your personal data if we feel it is necessary in order to protect or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors, officers, or shareholders, and/or to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud community.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Change of Control</strong> \u2013 We may also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control of SoundCloud, or in preparation for any of these events.\nAny other entity that buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your personal data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Targeted Communications &amp.\nAdvertising</strong> - Here you will find a list of external advertising partners with whom we cooperate and share personal data (often in aggregated or de-identified forms) for analytics, targeted communications and targeted advertising purposes, should you have consented and not turned these toggles off in your settings.\nAny such consent will be gained through our cookie consent tool or via your settings in your account.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>SoundCloud Direct</strong> - In the event you choose to grant other users access to your SoundCloud Direct account, or in the event you set up our Split Pay feature, some personal data, such as your name and email address, will be available to those users.\nAdditionally, if you use SC Planner, your SC Planner profile will be visible to other users in the \u201cLeaderboard\u201d section of the App, unless you elect to make your profile invisible in your settings.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\nCookies and Similar Technology\n<p>As further described in our Cookie Policy we use cookies and similar technologies (e.g.\npixels, local storage, and device identifiers) to recognize you and/or your device(s) on and off the Platform, and across devices.\nTo the extent allowed by your settings or your device, we also allow third parties to use cookies as described in our Cookie Policy in order to track user behavior on and off the Platform in order to show you ads based on your interests and preferences.\nYou can control cookies through your browser and other tools as described in the Cookie Policy.</p>\n<p>Please be aware any use of cookies is subject to your consent, except for technical storage or access for transmitting communication, or as strictly necessary to provide a service which was explicitly requested by a user.\n</p>\n<p>You will find information regarding the use of cookies from specific third parties when making the choice of cookies you want to allow within our cookie consent tool.\nFurther information is provided in your account settings under \u201cadvertising\u201d, where you may as well toggle your choices after your first decision.\n</p>\nInformation Security\n<p>SoundCloud maintains appropriate technical, administrative, and physical safeguards that are designed to prevent unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal data we collect or store and to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons that may be involved with our processing operations.\nWe regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks.\nHowever, it is not possible to guarantee the security of personal data transmitted over the Internet.\nYou use the Platform and provide us with personal data at your own discretion and risk.</p>\nInternational Data Transfers\n<p>SoundCloud operates globally and may share your personal data internally within the SoundCloud Group and third parties for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nPersonal data collected within the EEA may, for example, be transferred to countries outside of the EEA for the purposes as described in this Privacy Policy.\nWe utilize appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission, or another legally approved mechanism, to ensure the lawful transfer of your personal data outside of the EEA.\nThe Standard Contractual Clauses can be accessed at any time here.\nAlternatively, you can request these documents from us using the contact details given below.</p>\nChildren\n<p>SoundCloud is not intended for use by children.\nAnyone under the age of 16 in the EEA and UK, or 13 in the United States and the rest of the world, is not permitted to use the Platform and must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal data to us.\nWe do not knowingly collect any personal data from any person who is under the age of 16 or 13, as the case may be, or allow them to register an account.\nIf it comes to our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 16 or 13, as applicable, we will delete this personal data as quickly as possible.\nIf you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such personal data, please notify us immediately at dataprotection@soundcloud.com.</p>\nOur Activity On Social Networks\n<p>To allow us to communicate with you on third party social networks and inform you about our services, we run pages on third party social networks.\nIf you visit our pages on any of these third party social media pages, we and the provider of the third party social media network are joint controllers regarding the processing operations thereby triggered, which concern personal data.\nWe are not the original provider of these pages, but only use them within the scope of the options offered to us by the respective providers.</p>\n<p>For our EU/EEA based users, we would like to point out that your personal data may also be processed outside of the EU or the EEA.\nUse of these networks may therefore involve data protection risks for you since the protection of your rights may be difficult, e.g.\nyour right to information, erasure, objection, etc.\nProcessing on social networks frequently takes place directly for advertising purposes or for the analysis of user behavior by network providers, and we have no control over this.\nIf the provider creates user profiles, cookies are often used or user behavior may be assigned directly to your own member profile on the respective social network (if you are logged in).</p>\n<p>The processing operations of personal data described are carried out on the basis of our legitimate interests and the legitimate interests of the respective provider in order to communicate with you in a timely manner or to inform you about our services.\nIf you get asked to grant your consent to the respective providers to process your personal data as a user, your consent is the legal basis for this processing.</p>\n<p>Since we have no access to these providers\u2019 databases, we would like to point out that you would be best situated to exercise your rights (e.g.\nto information, rectification, erasure, etc.) directly with the respective provider.\nMore information on the processing of your personal data on social networks and your options for exercising your right to object or your right of revocation (opt out) is listed below for each of the social network providers we use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Facebook</strong> - (Jointly) For Europe: Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd, 4 Grand Canal

amount of personal data you provide to us, and the control you have over that personal data.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Managing SoundCloud Settings</strong> - If you register an account, you may manage the content and personal data you share when you use SoundCloud through your account Settings, including for the features explained below.\nYou are solely responsible for keeping your Settings up-to-date.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Email &amp.\nDevice Notifications</strong> \u2013 You can adjust your Settings in the \u201cNotification\u201d tab to disable email and device notifications (other than important service updates and essential notifications about the Platform or your account).\nAll commercial emails and newsletters also allow you to unsubscribe at any time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Analytics</strong> \u2013 To control whether we collect analytics and usage information, including through cookies and similar technologies, you can adjust your Settings in the \u201cPrivacy\u201d tab (\u201cCookie Manager\u201d).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Marketing</strong> \u2013 If you do not want to receive personalized ads, offers or other marketing messages for SoundCloud products or services, you can adjust your Settings in the \u201cPrivacy\u201d tab (choose Communications in Your \u201cCookie Manager\u201d).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Advertising</strong> \u2013 If you do not want SoundCloud to deliver \u201cinterest based\u201d or personalized ads for third party products, you can adjust your Settings in the \u201cAdvertising\u201d tab.\nPlease note, however, that even if you opt out of personalized ads, you may still see ads, but they will likely not be as relevant or useful to you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Material Sharing</strong> \u2013 It\u2019s not possible to make your account entirely private.\nHowever, you do have the option to make all of your Tracks, playlists and other uploads private.\nThis means that no one will be able to access and listen to your Tracks without your explicit permission.\nYou can learn more about these settings here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Party Apps</strong> \u2013 If you have chosen to connect your account to a third-party application, like Facebook or Google, you can disable permission for the app by adjusting your Settings in the \u201cAccount\u201d tab.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Party Developers</strong> \u2013 SoundCloud has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of the Platform.\nIf you would prefer that your Tracks are not made available to third party app developers, you can disable API access within the sound page for each of the Tracks that you upload.\nClick on the pencil icon below the waveform player, and navigate to the \u201cPermissions\u201d tab and uncheck the \u201cenable app playback\u201d box.\nPlease note that your public profile information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that is not publicly available on the Platform.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Deleting Your SoundCloud Account</strong> \u2013 If you have an account and would like to delete it, you may do so by adjusting your Settings in the account tab.\nIf you delete your account, all personal data associated with your account (except for backup copies), including the Tracks that you have uploaded and the usage data associated with those Tracks, will be deleted and may not be recoverable.\nWe therefore advise you to copy or backup all Materials uploaded to your account before deletion.\nEven if you delete your account, it is possible that your personal data may still show up in some internet search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages.\nSearch engines\u2019 caching processes are outside of SoundCloud\u2019s control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any personal data that remains cached by search engines after that personal data has been removed from the Platform.\nPlease note that deleting any SoundCloud Apps, or any third party apps to which your account is connected, will not delete your account.\nSimilarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all personal data about your activity on the Platform from within that third party app.\nYou will need to refer to the app provider\u2019s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete personal data about your activity on the Platform from that third party app.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Messages From Other Users</strong> - If you do not want to receive messages from users you don\u2019t follow, you can adjust your settings in the \u201cPrivacy\u201d tab.\nIf you want to block users, you will have to do so on their respective profiles.\nAny blocked user will be shown in your settings in the \u201cPrivacy\u201d tab.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Managing Device Settings</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On your mobile device, disable the \u201cAllow Apps to Request to Track\u201d setting in your iOS phone\u2019s settings, or enable the setting to \u201cOpt out of Ads Personalization\u201d in your Android phone\u2019s settings.\nTo opt-out of location tracking when using our Apps, you can use the settings of your device.\nYou can disable mobile analytics and bug reporting through these same settings as well.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Managing Browser Settings</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You may also control cookies in your browser settings.\nYou can modify your settings in most web browsers to accept or deny cookies or to request your permission each time a site attempts to set a cookie.\nYou can also manually delete previously stored cookies at any time.\nPlease note that if you choose to block cookies, doing so may impair the Platform or prevent certain elements of it from functioning.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\nExercising Your EU Privacy Rights\n<p>If you are a user residing in the EU/EEA, you may exercise any of the rights described in this section through the Help Center or by contacting us at

- You may be entitled to request copies of your personal data held by us.\nWhile a lot of the personal data you provide to us can be accessed in your account settings, you may also be entitled to request copies of personal data you have provided to us in machine-readable format.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Change or Correct Data</strong> - Where you cannot update personal data yourself through an account, you have the right to ask us to correct, change, update or rectify your personal data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Retention and Deletion</strong> - We generally retain personal data for as long as is necessary to provide services to you under your account, i.e.\nas long as your contract is ongoing and for the sake of legal obligations, for 3 years following the end of the year in which your contract was canceled - or, for as long as is necessary to provide the Platform to you as a unregistered user.\nYou have the right to ask us to delete all or some of the personal data we hold about you.\nIf you have an account, you can also delete your account through the Settings at any time as described below.\nWe may need to retain some of your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (e.g.\nunder applicable tax or commercial law or to prevent fraud and abuse and maintain and enhance security).\nAfterwards, we delete the personal data immediately, unless we need the personal data until the expiry of the statutory period of limitation for the purpose of providing evidence for civil law claims or because of statutory storage obligations (e.g.\nfor accounting reasons).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Objection to Processing</strong> - You have the right to object to processing your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation at any time (in particular, where we don\u2019t have to process the personal data to meet a contractual or other legal requirement, or where we are using the personal data on the basis of our legitimate interests).\nIf you object to such processing, SoundCloud will no longer process your personal data for these purposes unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such processing or such processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or obligations.\nWhere your personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object to such processing of your personal data at any time and ask SoundCloud to cease processing your data for these direct marketing purposes.\nHowever, please be aware that any objection to processing will not necessarily have an impact on the personal data processing before such objection was made, thus such processing will generally be deemed as permissible and will be subject to the usual retention and deletion periods.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Restriction of Processing</strong> - You have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data where one of the following applies: your personal data is not accurate anymore.\nthe processing is unlawful and instead of erasing the personal data you request

the legitimate grounds for objection is pending.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Withdrawing Consent</strong> - Where you provide consent to the processing of your personal data by SoundCloud, you may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your account Settings or by sending a communication to SoundCloud specifying the specific consent you are withdrawing.\nPlease note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Lodging Complaints</strong> - You have the right to lodge complaints about the data processing activities carried out by SoundCloud before a competent data protection authority.\nA list of EU data protection authorities is available

Use.\n</p>\n<p>Capitalised terms used in this Cookie Policy, but not specifically defined in here, shall have the meanings given to the applicable capitalised terms in the SoundCloud Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>Like most companies, when you visit or interact with the Platform, we and our service providers may use cookies and other tracking technologies for storing information, including pixels (also known as a \u201cweb beacon\u201d or \u201cclear GIFs\u201d), local storage, and device identifiers, to help provide, protect and improve the Platform.\nFor example, to save your preferences, personalize content, target ads based on your interests, combat fraud and abuse, and streamline the functioning of and your access to the Platform.</p>\n<p>This policy explains how and why we use these technologies and the choices you have.\nWe use \u201ccookies\u201d and \u201csimilar technologies\u201d interchangeably to refer to all of these technologies.</p>\nWhat Are Cookies?\n<p>Cookies are small text files placed on your computer, phone, or other device when you visit websites and are used to record information about your activity, including the pages you view, the content you listen to, ads you click on, your settings, and other actions you take on the Platform.</p>\n<p>Cookies can be \u201cpersistent\u201d or \u201csession\u201d cookies.\nPersistent cookies stay on your device for a set period of time or until you delete them, while session cookies are deleted once you close your web browser.</p>\nSimilar Technologies\n<p>We use other data collecting technologies with similar functionality as cookies, including pixels, local storage, and device identifiers.\nWhile the specific names and types of cookies we use may change from time to time as we improve and update the Platform, we have provided some basic definitions in order to help you better understand this policy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Pixels</strong> \u2013 A pixel is a small amount of code on a web page or in an email notification that typically works in conjunction with cookies to identify our users and record user behavior.\nAs many services do, we use pixels to learn whether you\u2019ve interacted with certain web or email content.\nThis helps us measure and improve our services and personalize your experience.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Local Storage</strong> \u2013 Local storage is an industry-standard technology that allows a website or application to store information locally on your computer or mobile device.\nWe use local storage to customize what we show you based on your content consumption and other past interactions with the Platform.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Device Identifiers</strong> \u2013 We also use Device Identifiers, also known as mobile device and advertising identifiers, for the same purposes articulated in this policy, for example to recognize your device when you return to the Platform or otherwise use the Platform.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Software Development Kits</strong> \u2013 We may use third parties including our service providers and business partners who use mobile SDKs to collect information to recognize your device when you return to the Platform.\nWe may use this technology, for instance, to analyze how you interact with the Platform, including content and advertisements, and to enable analytics or other features through mobile devices.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\nHow We Use Cookies\n<p>While we use cookies to deliver, measure, and improve the Platform in various ways, the cookies we use generally fall into one of the following categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Strictly Necessary (Operational) Cookies</strong> \u2013 These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems.\nThey are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms.\nYou can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site won\u2019t work then.\nThese cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.\nCookies necessary to maintain the Platform secure and free of abuse are also considered strictly necessary.\nThese cookies enable and support our security features, and help us detect malicious or unauthorized activity.\nWe also use cookies to combat fraud and other activity that violates our policies or otherwise degrades our ability to provide the Platform.\nCookies also help us fight spam and phishing attacks by enabling us to identify computers or devices that are used to create large numbers of fake SoundCloud accounts.\nSuch Cookies ensure the intended functionality of our services and are therefore strictly necessary and we use these cookies based on legitimate interest.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Performance Cookies</strong> - These cookies allow us to count unique visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site.\nThey help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site.\nIf you do not allow these cookies, we will not know when you have visited our site as all information collected about your behavior on SoundCloud will be anonymous.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Functional Cookies</strong> - These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation.\nThey may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages.\nIf you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly.\nFor example, when you continue to use or come back to the Platform, we will recognize your user name and remember your settings and content preferences.\nDeletion, blocking or choosing against these types of cookies will result in limited functionality of the Platform.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Targeted Cookies (Personalization/Advertising)</strong> \u2013 These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners.\nThey may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites.\nThey do not store directly personal information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device.\nIf you do not allow these cookies, the advertisements you\u2019ll see will be less personalized.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Communications Cookies</strong> - These cookies allow us to show personalized news, tips, and offers for SoundCloud products based on your use of our Platform.\nIf you turn this setting off, the communications you\u2019ll see may be less relevant.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies Relating to the IAB Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF)</strong> - This framework provides granular only choices for our users and guarantees that any publishers and vendors registered under this framework adhere to the standards of the IAB TCF and therefore only use information you are willing to share for their advertisements.\nThe IAB TCF is used for vendors / publishers only and presents a granular set of possible choices.\nPublishers will adhere to these choices which are guaranteed by the IAB.\nPlease refer to the extensive documentation within the Consent Management Platform for further details.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Additional Cookies for Registered Users</strong> - For registered users, we use additional advertising services that are as well based on cookies.\nYou will be prompted with different choices for allowing or rejecting cookies for our advertising partners.\nSome of these cookies, although named \u201cadvertising cookies\u201d may be usable without your consent, as they are necessary for the safety of your data and our services or they are used for providing certain functions and analysis of the SoundCloud service.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\nThird Party Cookies\n<p>We allow certain service providers to place cookies and similar technologies on the Platform for the same purposes listed above, including collecting information about your online activities over time and across different websites and devices in order to provide you with more relevant advertising.</p>\n<p>\u200b\u200bThird party analytics are used to track and measure usage of this site so that we can continue to produce engaging content.\nThese cookies may track things such as how long you spend on the site or pages you visit which helps us to understand how we can improve the site for you.\nFrom time to time we test new features and make subtle changes to the way that the site is delivered.\nWhen we are still testing new features these cookies may be used to ensure that you receive a consistent experience when using the site whilst ensuring we understand which optimisations our users appreciate the most.</p>\n<p>You may also encounter cookies and tracking technologies from our third-party marketing service providers.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we may work with advertising networks and programmatic exchanges to allow us to serve you ads.\nThese third-party ad networks and exchange providers may use third-party cookies, pixels, or similar technologies to collect information, including your device identifier, IP address, or identifier for advertising.\nThe information these third parties collect may be used to help us in providing you with more relevant advertising that we serve on or off the Platform, and as described above.</p>\n<p>As we sell services it's important for us to understand statistics about how many of the visitors to our site actually make a purchase and as such this is the kind of data that these cookies will track.\nThis is important to you as it means that we can accurately make business predictions that allow us to monitor our advertising and product costs to ensure the best possible price.</p>\n<p>We use adverts to offset the costs of running this site and provide funding for further development.\nThe behavioral advertising cookies used by our Platform are designed to ensure that we provide you with the most relevant adverts where possible by anonymously tracking your interests and presenting similar things that may be of interest.</p>\n<p>Several partners advertise on our behalf and affiliate tracking cookies simply allow us to see if our customers have come to the site through one of our partner sites so that we can credit them appropriately and where applicable allow our affiliate partners to provide any bonus that they may provide you for making a purchase.</p>\n<p>We also use social media buttons and/or plugins on the Platform that allow you to connect with your social network in various ways.\nThe social media networks will set cookies through our site which may be used to enhance your profile on their site or contribute to the data they hold for various purposes outlined in their respective privacy policies.</p>\n<p>Third-party cookies are covered by the third parties\u2019 privacy policy.</p>\n<p>SoundCloud works with reputable advertising partners to show you content and advertisements for products and services that you may like.\nAdvertising partners are divided by purpose, function and websites.\nBy purpose, some Cookies can be subject to your consent or objection whereas others are based on our legitimate interest.\nWithin the Cookie Management Platform, you can navigate to the respective cookie category to see which particular cookies are first party or third party cookies.</p>\nYour Choices and Controls\n<p>SoundCloud is committed to offering you meaningful privacy choices.\nYou have a number of options to control or limit how we, our partners, and other third parties use cookies.\nHowever, note that cookies are important for many aspects of the Platform \u2013 if you disable cookies, you may not be able to enjoy all of the features of the Platform.\nTo the extent you opt out of personalized advertising using the mechanisms below, you may still receive advertisements when using the Platform, but they will not be tailored to your interests.</p>\nConsent Management Platform (\"CMP\")\n<p>We use a Consent Management Platform (\u201cCMP\u201d) to give you the choice on which Cookies you like to allow and which not.\nIn some countries, subject to the respective laws, it is allowed to set such Cookies by default but you may as well access your profile settings to make a choice of your liking here.</p>\n<p>The CMP allows you to consent to the setting of optional cookies by us and our third-party partners.\nAdditionally, third party cookies can be managed according to the purpose for which your data is processed or according to which third-party partners are involved.\nThe CMP also allows us to maintain records of your consent.\n</p>\n<p>Strictly Necessary Cookies and other cookies based on legitimate interest (security and abuse) are not subject to your choice regarding our CMP but are used in our legitimate interest.\nSuch interest has been reviewed against your interest of not using any of your data and leaving such cookies on your devices and it has been appropriately documented why such use of Cookies is deemed necessary for our services.\nYou can however even block these Cookies, for example within the settings of your browser, but this will ultimately disable the use of our service or the most essential parts of it.</p>\n<p>As a registered user, you will find the explanation to the relevant cookies in your account under \u201cPrivacy\u201d and \u201cAdvertising\u201d as well.\nHere you can view and control your respective choices.\n</p>\nSoundCloud Settings\n<p>If you have a SoundCloud account, you can adjust the following settings to reflect your choices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To control whether we collect certain kinds of analytics and usage information through cookies and similar technologies, you can adjust your settings in the \u201cPrivacy\u201d tab.\nHere you will be presented with the CMP that is explained above.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you do not want SoundCloud to deliver \u201cinterest based\u201d or personalized ads for third party products, you can adjust your settings in the \u201cAdvertising\u201d tab.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Users without a SoundCloud account can control whether we collect certain kinds of analytics and usage information through cookies and similar technologies in the Cookie Manager tab.</p>\n<p>Users with a SoundCloud account may adjust their settings in the Cookie Manager to be found in the \u201cPrivacy\u201d tab, or by clicking here.</p>\nBrowser Settings\n<p>To control cookies, you can modify your settings in most web browsers to accept or deny cookies or to request your permission each time a site attempts to set a cookie.\nYou can also manually delete previously stored cookies at any time.\nPlease note that if you choose to block cookies, doing so may impair the Platform or prevent certain elements of it from functioning.\nAdditionally you may be prompted a question by your browser referring to cross-site tracking.\nThis means that you have to agree to sites and services before connecting your usage of one service or the choices you made there with your usage of another site.\nYou may opt-out of this when prompted this question or make a choice within your browser settings.</p>\nDevice Settings\n<p>On your mobile device, disable the \u201cAllow Apps to Request to Track\u201d setting in your iOS phone\u2019s settings, or enable the setting to \u201cOpt Out of Ads Personalization\u201d in your Android phone\u2019s settings.\nTo opt-out of location tracking when using our Apps, you can use the settings of your device.\nYou can disable mobile analytics and bug reporting through these same settings as well.\nAdditionally you may be prompted a question by your browser or our app referring to cross-app tracking.\nThis means that you have to agree to sites and services before connecting your usage of one service or the choices you made there with your usage of another site, app or service.\nYou may opt-out of this when prompted this question or make a choice within your device or app settings.</p>\nMobile Identifiers\n<p>On your mobile device, your operating system may provide you with options to opt out of interest based advertising or to otherwise reset your mobile identifier.\nThis is a unique identifier that can be used to identify a mobile device which works in a similar way to a cookie.\nFor example, you may use the \"Limit Ad Tracking\" setting (on iOS devices) or a setting to \"Opt out of Interest-Based Ads\" (on Android) which allows you to limit the use of information about your use of apps for purposes of serving ads targeted to your interests.</p>\nUpdates to This Policy\n<p>We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.\nIf they are material changes, we will provide you with prominent notice.</p>\nContact Us\n<p>If you have
