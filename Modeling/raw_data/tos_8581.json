26.04.2021<br>\n<br> You can contact us at info@Poopfight.io<br>\nYou can contact our Data Protection Officer at info@Poopfight.io<br>\nIn this Privacy and Cookie Notice, we describe how we use cookies and process data, including personal data, when you visit a website that is part of our network.<br>\nWe are committed to lawful, fair, and transparent processing of personal data, adhering to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).<br>\n<br> \u201cJUST THE BASICS\u201d<br>\nWhich data do we process when you use our sites and apps?<br>\nWhen you play a game or watch a video, we process information about these activities.<br>\nThis includes information such as IP addresses, which games you played, advertising IDs, general browser and device information like the brand and type, and country.<br>\n<br> Why do we process this data?<br>\nWe process data in order to:<br>\n- Deliver ads that more accurately reflect your interests.<br>\n- Perform analytics to see how you and other players use our sites and/or apps.\nThis helps us provide you with more useful customised content.<br>\n- For example, we can offer you more relevant games and select new games based on what\u2019s popular.<br>\n- Provide social media functionality.\nThis means that you can easily share games, high-scores, and other content from Poopfight.io.<br>\n<br> Who can give consent?<br>\nYou need to be 16 years or older to give consent.<br>\n<br> What are my rights?<br>\nYou have the right to request access to your personal data.\nYou also have the right to:<br>\n- Rectify incorrect personal data, or, when certain circumstances apply, to erase it.<br>\n- Restrict or object to the processing of your personal data.<br>\n- Receive your data so that you can use it elsewhere (data portability).<br>\n<br> Where we process data on the basis of your consent, you also have the right to withdraw your consent for future processing at any time.\nPlease go click here to change your consent settings.<br>\nWho do we share data with?<br>\nWe allow a limited number of advertising, analytics, and social media companies to also place cookies and/or collect your data via Poopfight.\nYou can see a detailed list below.\nUnder certain circumstances, other third parties may also place cookies and/or collect your data.\nHowever, we can\u2019t know beforehand which third parties this may involve.<br>\n<br> \u201cALL THE DETAILS\u201d<br>\nPoopfight.io and third parties process personal data mostly with the help of cookies.\nTo help you understand what this means, we will first describe the use of cookies on our website below.<br>\nWe will then explain how personal data is processed, including the use of those cookies.<br>\n<br> 1.How do we use cookies?<br>\nCookies are small pieces of information (small files) stored on your equipment (such as your computer).<br>\nAs the website owner, we place cookies when you visit our website, as do the third-parties that we work with directly to deliver games and ads.\nWhile we control this process, you can use our consent tool to make choices about the cookies you wish to allow and the personal data processing that occurs with the help of those cookies.<br>\nBecause of the way online games and ads work, third parties with whom we do not work directly, but who also deliver games and ads via our website, may also place cookies.\nThis is not something we can control.<br>\nBelow we describe which cookies Poopfight.io uses, for what purpose, and the duration of their use.<br>\n<br> 1.1 Cookies that help to ensure that the website functions properly<br>\nOur website uses cookies:<br>\n- to remember information you enter when you fill in forms or input fields on various pages.\nWe do this so that you won\u2019t have to enter all of this information again the next time you visit.<br>\n- to store preferences such as language settings, location settings, the number of search results you wish to display per page, etc.<br>\n- to store settings for optimal (video) display, such as the optimal or desired buffer size and information regarding your screen resolution.<br>\n- to read your browser settings, ensuring that our website is displayed properly on your screen.<br>\n- to detect abuse of our website and services, for instance by registering repeated failed attempts to log in.<br>\n- to ensure an even load (page requests) across the website, allowing us to keep the website available to our visitors.<br>\n- to offer the option to store login details so that you do not have to log in manually the next time you visit the website.<br>\n- to enable you to interact with our website in a whole range of different ways, such as social media interaction, or leaving direct feedback.<br>\n<br> 1.2 Cookies allowing us to sell and show ads<br>\nMost of our domains/games are provided free of charge.\nAdvertising income is used to cover the costs.\nThis means that ads are a vital source of income, and are necessary to keep the domains running.\nSome advertisements (or videos) use cookies.\nThese ads are placed on our websites by us and/or media companies and advertising networks.\nAdvertising networks and media companies function as a middleman between us as the website owner and advertisers.<br>\nThese cookies ensure that it is possible to:<br>\n- track which ads you have already seen, and prevent you from being shown the same ad over and over again.<br>\n- track how many visitors click on an advertisement, so that we can balance the books with advertisers.<br>\n- track how many orders are placed via the ads, so that we can balance the books with advertisers.<br>\nPlease note that you will still be shown advertisements even if these cookies are not used.\nAfter all, we also display ads that do not use cookies.\nFor more information regarding the cookies used by these advertising networks and the data these parties collect using those cookies, we refer you to the terms and conditions / privacy policies applicable to these platforms as listed on their own websites.\nPlease see the advertising networks websites listed and linked below to view the terms and conditions / privacy policies that may apply.\nPlease note, however, that these terms and conditions / privacy policies may be subject to change without notice.<br>\nWe do not have any influence on these separate terms and conditions.<br>\n- Improve Digital<br>\n- OpenX<br>\n- OneVideo<br>\n- Pubmatic<br>\n- Rubicon Project<br>\n- Google Ads<br>\n- SpotX<br>\n- AppNexus<br>\n<br> 1.3 Cookies that allow us to gather information about the way visitors use our website<br>\nTo find out which sections of our website our visitors like best, we continually try to measure how many visitors our website attracts and which pages they view most often.\nTo do this, we use our own cookies and/or those provided by third parties.\nThe information we gather in this manner is used to generate statistics.\nThese statistics provide us with insights into how often visitors come to our web pages, which pages they spend the most time viewing, how often they interact with (part of) a page, and so on.\nThis allows us to make the structure, navigation, and content of our website as user-friendly as possible.\nWe do not trace our statistics and other reports back to individual people.<br>\nWe use cookies to:<br>\n- keep track of the number of visitors on our webpages.<br>\n- keep track of the amount of time visitors spend on our webpages.<br>\n- determine the order in which a visitor views the various pages belonging to our website.<br>\n- determine which parts of our website (or pages) need to be adjusted.<br>\n- optimise the website (or parts of it).<br>\n<br> 1.4 Cookies used to increase the relevance of the content of the website<br>\nWe aim to provide our visitors with relevant information.\nThat is why we work to tailor our website to each visitor\u2019s needs and interest.\nIn order to adjust the website to reflect your interests more accurately, we try to get an impression of the things you like based on the websites you have previously visited.\nIn doing so, we do not construct a profile that can be traced to any individual person.\nWe tailor the content and the ads shown on our website to different groups of visitors.\nOn the basis of your online history, you may be put into a certain category, such as \u201cwomen aged 35-45, married, with children, interested in ballet\u201d.<br>\nThis group will, of course, be shown different ads than the group \u201cmen aged 20-30, unmarried, interested in cooking\u201d.\nThird parties (advertisers) who place cookies via our website may use similar technologies to find out what interests you.\nIn this case, information about your current visit to the website may be combined with information from earlier visits to other websites besides our own.\nWhen such cookies are not used, this does not mean that you will no longer be shown any ads on our websites.\nInstead, the ads will just be less likely to match your interests.<br>\nThese cookies make it possible:<br>\n- for websites to register your visit in order to try to guess what you might be interested in.<br>\n- to register whether you clicked on an advertisement (i.e.\nclick-through behaviour).<br>\n- to pass on information about your browsing behaviour to other websites.<br>\n- to use services provided by third parties to display ads (re-targeted marketing).<br>\n- to show more interesting ads based on your social media usage (i.e.\nsocial media behaviour).<br>\nFor more information regarding the cookies used by these advertising networks and the data these parties collect using those cookies, we refer you to the terms and conditions / privacy policies applicable to these platforms as listed on their own websites.\nPlease see the advertising networks websites listed and linked below to view the terms and conditions / privacy policies that may apply.\n(Please note, however, that these terms and conditions / privacy policies may be subject to change without notice.)<br>\nWe do not have any influence on these separate terms and conditions.<br>\n- Improve Digital<br>\n- OpenX<br>\n- OneVideo<br>\n- Pubmatic<br>\n- Rubicon Project<br>\n- Google Ads<br>\n- SpotX<br>\n- AppNexus<br>\n<br> 1.6 Other/unforeseen<br>\nBecause of the way the internet and websites work, it may be that we do not always have insight into the cookies that third parties place via our website.\nThis is especially the case if our web pages contain so-called embedded elements.\nThese are games that are stored with another party, but which are shown on, in, or via our website.\nIf you encounter cookies on this website that fall into this category, and do not correspond to the previous categories described above, please let us know.\nYou can also contact the third party directly and ask which cookies they place on your device, why they do this, and what personal data they process with the cookie.\nYou may also wish to ask what the lifespan of the cookie is and what safeguards they have taken to protect your privacy.<br>\n<br> 2.\nHow does Poopfight.io use personal data?<br>\n<br> 2.1 Data used by Poopfight.io to sell and show ads<br>\nWe process personal data on all Poopfight.io websites.\nBelow, we describe in more detail what types of personal data we process and for what purpose.<br>\nWe collect and process the following types of (personal) data:<br>\n- The page you visited (URL).\nThis contains an abbreviation of the name of the game you played.<br>\n- General data about the browser used.\nFor instance, whether you use Chrome or Firefox, and which version.<br>\n- Whether you use a desktop/laptop or tablet/smartphone to visit the website.<br>\n- The version and language of the operating system used.<br>\n- The IP address used (the address of the internet connection)<br>\n- Upon access, the approximate geographical location of the visitor based on the IP address, at the country or region level.<br>\n<br> What we use the data for<br>\n- We use the data we collect to enable the automated auction (bidding process) of the ad inventory of our clients, and to record views and clicks on ads.<br>\n<br> Our legal basis for processing this data<br>\nWe base our data processing on the consent granted by the data subject.<br>\n<br> Where do we obtain the data from?<br>\nWe collect data via the cookies mentioned above.<br>\n<br> How long do we store data?<br>\nWe store data for up to 90 days.\nIf we interact with cookies stored on your device, this period starts over again.<br>\n<br> Who do we share data with?<br>\nWe share the above mentioned data with a large number of buyers, such as advertisers, brands, media agencies, and other intermediaries, although not all buyers receive the same data.\nThe list of buyers changes on a continuing basis, and for this reason we cannot include a comprehensive list here.<br>\n<br> 2.2 Transfer of your personal data<br>\nIf you are an EU resident, would like to inform you that we may transfer your personal data from your home country to other countries and organizations.\nWhen we transfer this data, we will do so only when we have put in place appropriate safeguards (you can obtain more information about these safeguards by writing to our DPO), or if we have obtained your explicit consent for such a transfer.<br>\n<br> 3.\nYour rights to your data<br>\nAccess

contact us at info@Poopfight.io.\nWe will provide you with instructions regarding the information (cookie) we need for you so that we are able to find the data in question.<br>\nIf you ask us to delete your data, we reserve the right to store the data we need to meet our legal and internal audit requirements.<br>\nYou also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.<br>\n<br> 4.\nRevoke consent for Poopfight.io cookies and data processing<br>\nYou have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, but we would like to point out that this does not affect the lawfulness of the processing before the date that you withdraw your consent.\nTo revoke your consent, please click here<br>\n5.\nAdditional information<br>\nWe use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site.\nThese companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web
