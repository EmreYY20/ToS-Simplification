Plausible Analytics is to track the usage of a website, this can still be done without collecting any personal data or personally identifiable information (PII), without using cookies and while respecting the privacy of the website visitors.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a closer look at our data policy, the information that we do collect, what we use it for and steps we\u2019ve taken to comply with

compliant web analytics</li>\n</ol> First thing first: What we collect and what we use it for <p>We do not track people across their devices and across websites and apps that they visit.\nAll the data is isolated to a single day, single website and single device only.\nThere is no way to know whether the same person visits a site from more than one device or visits another website.\nSee here the full list of what makes Plausible a privacy-first web analytics tool.</p>\n<p>The goal of Plausible is to track overall trends in your website traffic, it is not to track individual visitors.\nWe don\u2019t use cookies, we don\u2019t generate any persistent identifiers and we don\u2019t collect or store any personal or identifiable data.\nAll of the data is aggregated data only and it has no personal information.</p>\n<p>By using Plausible Analytics, all the site measurement is carried out absolutely anonymously.\nWe measure only the most essential data points and nothing else.\nAll the metrics we do collect fit on one single page.\nHere is the complete list of what we collect and store about your website visitors:</p> Data point Example Comment <strong>Page URL</strong>\n<em>https://yoursite.com/pricing</em> We track the page URL of each page view on your website.\nWe use this to show you which pages have been viewed and how many times a particular page has been viewed.\n<br>\n<br>The hostname and path are collected.\nQuery parameters are discarded, except for these special query parameters: <code>ref=</code>, <code>source=</code>, <code>utm_source=</code>, <code>utm_medium=</code> and <code>utm_campaign=</code>.\n<strong>HTTP Referer</strong>\n<em>https://facebook.com</em> We use the referrer string to show you the number of visitors referred to your website from links on other sites.\n<strong>Browser</strong>\n<em>Chrome 86.0</em> We use this to show you what browsers and browser version numbers people use when visiting your website.\nThis is derived from the User-Agent HTTP header.\nThe full User-Agent is discarded.\n<strong>Operating system</strong>\n<em>macOS 10.15</em> We use this to show you what operating systems people use when visiting your website.\nWe show the brand of the operating system and the version number.\nThis is derived from the User-Agent HTTP header.\nThe full User-Agent is discarded.\n<strong>Device type</strong>\n<em>Desktop</em> We use this to show you what devices people use when visiting your website.\nThis is derived from window.innerWidth.\nThe actual width of the browser in pixels is discarded.\n<strong>Country, region, city</strong>\n<em>United Kingdom, England, London</em> We look up the visitor\u2019s location using their IP address.\nWe do not track anything more granular than the city level and the IP address of the visitor is discarded.\nWe never store IP addresses in our database or logs.\nHow we count unique users without cookies <p>Counting unique visitors is an integral part of web analytics.\nPlausible attempts to strike a reasonable balance between de-duplicating pageviews and staying respectful of visitor privacy.</p>\n<p>We do not attempt to generate a device-persistent identifier because they are considered personal data under GDPR.\nWe do not use cookies, browser cache nor the local storage.\nWe do not store, retrieve nor extract anything from visitor\u2019s devices.</p>\n<p>Every single HTTP request sends the IP address and the User-Agent to the server so that\u2019s what we use.\nWe generate a daily changing identifier using the visitor\u2019s IP address and User-Agent.\nTo anonymize these datapoints and make them impossible to relate back to the user, we run them through a hash function with a rotating salt.</p>\n<code>hash(daily_salt + website_domain + ip_address + user_agent)\n</code>\n<p>This generates a random string of letters and numbers that is used to calculate unique visitor numbers for the day.\nThe raw data IP address and User-Agent are never stored in our logs, databases or anywhere on disk at all.</p>\n<p>Old salts are deleted every 24 hours to avoid the possibility of linking visitor information from one day to the next.\nForgetting used salts also removes the possibility of the original IP addresses being revealed in a brute-force attack.\nThe raw IP address and User-Agent are rendered completely inaccessible to anyone, including ourselves.</p>\n<p>In our testing, using IP addresses to count visitors is remarkably accurate when compared to using a cookie.\nIn some cases it might even be more accurate than using a cookie because some visitors block cookies altogether.</p>\n<p>The biggest limitation with this approach is that we cannot do good retention analysis with Plausible.\nWe cannot show stats like <em>New vs Returning visitors</em> because they rely on having a persistent user identifier.</p>\n<p>If the same visitor visits your site five times in one day we will show that as one unique visitor.\nBut if the same visitor visits your site on five different days in a month we would show that as five unique visitors.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re happy to provide information on how Plausible is built to help you comply with the different privacy regulations.\nWe encourage you to discuss specific issues with your lawyer to help you decide whether our service allows you to fulfill the legal requirements that apply to you.</p> Hosted in the EU powered by European-owned cloud infrastructure <p>We\u2019re a small team based in the EU.\nThe legal entity is incorporated in Estonia.</p>\n<p>All of the data that we do track and collect is kept fully secured, encrypted and hosted on 100% renewable energy powered server in Falkenstein, Germany.\nThe server is owned by Hetzner, a European company.\nThis ensures that all of the website data is being covered by the European Union\u2019s strict laws on data privacy.</p>\n<p>We use Bunny (another European-owned provider from Slovenia) for a global CDN and DDoS protection.\nThis ensures that all visitor data we collect is exclusively processed with servers owned and operated by European companies.</p>\n<p>For encryption, we use https in transit and the hashing process at rest.\nWe also do regular backups.\nThe backups are also stored in the EU, in a redundant site.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve tried hard to limit external services that we use and none of them have access to any of the data that we do collect.\nNo third party vendors are involved other than the hosting company that owns the servers where the data is stored.\nYou can read more in our privacy policy.</p>\n<p>You don\u2019t have to worry about Schrems II and that it invalidates the EU-US

about your visitors.\nYou entrust us with your site data and we take that trust to heart.\nThe privacy of your site data \u2014 and it is your data, not ours! \u2014 is a big deal to us.</p>\n<p>By using Plausible, you keep 100% ownership of your website data.\nAlthough when using our hosted service, your site analytics are stored on our server in the cloud, you remain completely in control of your site data and you fully own all of your data too.</p>\n<p>You own all right, title, and interest to your website data.\nWe obtain no rights from you to your website data.\nWe will never sell or share your site data to any third-parties.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your website data is not shared with advertising companies or any other companies in general.</li>\n<li>Your website data is not sent to any third-parties at all.</li>\n<li>Your website data is not mined and harvested for personal and behavioral trends.</li>\n<li>Your website data is not monetized.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can choose to delete your account and delete your site stats at any time.\nWe provide simple no-questions-asked deletion links.</p>\n<p>All your stats will be permanently deleted immediately when you delete your Plausible

"Data Processing Agreement ", "url": "https://plausible.io/dpa", "xpath": "/html/body/main", "text": " Plausible Analytics Data Processing Agreement <p>Thank you for using Plausible Analytics!</p>\n<p>Note: The following DPA applies to Plausible Analytics Cloud only and not to self-hosted which would be hosted on your own servers and therefore the DPA isn\u2019t needed.</p>\n<p>Plausible Analytics is a European company and our data infrastructure is based in Germany covered by the EU\u2019s strong data privacy laws.\nProcessing and storing data in a secure, fair, and transparent way is extremely important to us.</p>\n<p>This Data Processing Agreement (\u201cDPA\u201d) is an addendum to the Terms of Service between Plausible Analytics and the customer.</p>\n<p>If you are accepting this DPA on behalf of your customer, you warrant that: (a) you have full legal authority to bind your customer to this DPA.\n(b) you have read and understand this DPA.\nand (c) you agree, on behalf of your customer, to this DPA.</p>\n<p>These service terms incorporate the Plausible Analytics Data Processing Agreement\u201d (\u201cDPA\u201d), when the General Data Protection regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) applies to your use of Plausible Analytics services to process visitor data as defined in the DPA.\nWe protect and secure your visitor data to the high standards set out in the agreement.</p> Definitions <ul>\n<li>\n<p>\u201cYou\u201d or \u201ccustomer\u201d refers to the company or organization that signs up to use the Plausible Analytics to analyze website\u2019s visitors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the course of providing the Plausible Analytics service to customer pursuant to the agreement, Plausible Analytics may process visitor data on behalf of customer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In this Data Processing Agreement (\u201cDPA\u201d), \u201cData Protection Legislation\u201d means the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/279), and all other applicable laws relating to processing of visitor data and privacy that may exist in any relevant jurisdiction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\u201cdata controller\u201d, \u201cdata processor\u201d, \u201cdata subject\u201d, \u201cpersonal data\u201d and \u201cprocessing\u201d shall be interpreted in accordance with applicable Data Protection Legislation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The parties agree that customer is the data controller and that Plausible Analytics is its data processor in relation to visitor data that is processed in the course of providing the service.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Privacy and security of your visitor data <p>We take many measures to protect and secure your data through backups, redundancies, and encryption.\nWhen you use our service to measure your website stats, Plausible Analytics will collect information about your visitors.</p>\n<p>You entrust us with your site data and we take that trust to heart.\nYou agree that Plausible Analytics may process your data as described in our data policy and for no other purpose.\nWe do our best to deserve that trust by being open about who we are, how we work, and keeping an open door to your feedback.</p>\n<p>You own all right, title, and interest to your website data.\nWe obtain no rights from you to your website data.\nWe do not collect and analyze personal information from web users and use these behavioral insights to sell advertisements.\nWhen using Plausible Analytics, you 100% own and control all of your website data.\nWe don\u2019t sell or share your site data to any third-parties, and we don\u2019t abuse your visitor\u2019s privacy.</p>\n<p>Even though the purpose of Plausible Analytics is to track the usage of a website, this can still be done without tracking, collecting or storing any personal data or personally identifiable information (PII), without using cookies and while respecting the privacy of your website visitors.</p>\n<p>By using Plausible Analytics, all the site measurement is carried out absolutely anonymously.\nWe minimize data collection in general.\nWe measure only the most essential data points and nothing else.\nAll the metrics we do collect fit on one single page.</p>\n<p>We do not attempt to generate a device-persistent identifier because they are considered personal data under GDPR.\nWe do not use cookies, browser cache nor the local storage.\nWe do not store, retrieve nor extract anything from visitor\u2019s devices.\nThe data we process cannot be used to identify any single individual.</p>\n<p>Every single HTTP request sends the IP address and the User-Agent to the server so that\u2019s what we use.\nWe generate a daily changing identifier using the visitor\u2019s IP address and User-Agent.\nTo anonymize these datapoints and make them impossible to relate back to the user, we run them through a hash function with a rotating salt.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>hash(daily_salt + website_domain + ip_address + user_agent)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This generates a random string of letters and numbers that is used to calculate unique visitor numbers for the day.\nThe raw data IP address and User-Agent are never stored in our logs, databases or anywhere on disk at all.</p>\n<p>Old salts are deleted every 24 hours to avoid the possibility of linking visitor information from one day to the next.\nForgetting used salts also removes the possibility of the original IP addresses being revealed in a brute-force attack.\nThe raw IP address and User-Agent are rendered completely inaccessible to anyone, including ourselves.</p>\n<p>The group of data subjects affected by the processing of their data under this agreement includes end-users of the controller\u2019s websites which make use of the service provided by the processor.</p>\n<p>You can find more information about our processing of your visitor data and what types/categories of data we collect on your behalf in our publicly available data policy.</p> Organizational and technical security measures <p>All of the data that we do track is kept fully secured, encrypted and hosted on renewable energy powered server in Germany.\nThis ensures that all of the website data is being covered by the European Union\u2019s strict laws on data privacy.\nYour visitor data never leaves the EU and EU-owned cloud infrastructure.\nYou can read about Hetzner and their server security certifications here.</p>\n<p>For encryption, we use https in transit and the hashing process at rest.\nOur hashing process is much stronger than encryption.\nEncryption implies that there\u2019s a key that can decrypt and reveal the raw data.\nIn our database the raw IP address and User Agent are rendered completely inaccessible to anyone, including ourselves.\nIn addition to this, we use strict firewall rules and private encrypted networking.\nWe keep offsite backups with replication including strong bcrypt passwords.</p>\n<p>Plausible Analytics is fully open source software which means that our source code is available and accessible on GitHub so anyone can check it out and audit it.\nYou can read it, inspect it and review it to understand how it works and to ensure it keeps the data private and secure.\nThis gives you and everyone else full transparency on how we handle the website traffic data.</p>\n<p>With more than 10,000 GitHub stars, there are a lot of eyes on our code and it is this transparency and openness that means that open source products can be more trustworthy than proprietary and closed source products.\nOur software is updated several times per week and on our GitHub page we also have a way for people to report any security vulnerabilities.</p> Processor\u2019s obligations with respect to the controller <ul>\n<li>\n<p>Plausible Analytics will process visitor data only in accordance with instructions from customer through the settings of the service, i.e.\n(a) to operate, maintain and

after having become aware of it), notify customer by email and provide customer with a description of the incident as well as periodic updates to information about the incident, including its impact on customer content.\nPlausible Analytics shall additionally take action to investigate the incident and reasonably prevent or mitigate the effects of the incident.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Plausible Analytics shall not on its own authority rectify, erase or restrict the processing of visitor data that is being processed on behalf of the controller (unless this is required by law or the Processor Terms of Service), but shall only do so on documented instructions from the controller and in accordance to the data retention rules associated to the controller subscription plan.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Plausible Analytics shall assist the controller in complying with the obligations concerning the security of personal data.\nPlausible will also provide assistance to the controller for DPIAs.\nWhere a data subject asserts their rights as a data subject, this request will be forwarded to the controller without delay.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> How we handle delete instructions <p>You can choose to delete your account and delete your site stats at any time.\nWe provide simple no-questions-asked deletion links.</p>\n<p>All your stats will be permanently deleted immediately
