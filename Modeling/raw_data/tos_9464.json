A sum is counted of the amount of time you have skipped in total Each time you downvote or hide a segment:\nIf you have downvote storage enabled: - A hash prefix of the videoID is stored locally along with a hash of the segment ID to keep that segment hidden when you watch the video in the future ## Children's Information Children under 13 are not allowed to use this service without permission from a legal guardian.\n## Consent By using this browser extension or API, you hereby consent to the Privacy Policy.\n## Data Access/Deletion Requests (GDPR) Please email me with your request.\n## Error logging and Cloudflare While I try to keep it's use to a minimum, I sometimes have to enable Cloudflare proxy to reduce load on the servers.\nI don't want to use it, but have to use it at the moment until I figure out a solution to this problem.\nWhen it is enabled, it logs some information itself that I cannot control, such as the number and location of connecting IPs.\nMore information can be found at https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/ I sometimes need to enable error logging in nginx.\nThis does log IPs associated with connection errors (not all requests), but I will delete these logs within 72 hours whenever that is enabled.\n## Additional Info If you have additional questions or require more information, contact me through email at dev@ajay.app.\nYou can also ask me questions on Discord (Ajay#1922) or [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@ajay:ajay.app).", "created_at": "2023-09-01 23:43:26.863909", "updated_at": "2023-09-01 23:47:04.382234"}, {"id": 18653, "name": "Privacy Policy for DeArrow", "url": "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ajayyy/9bfec83d57ea34f5182658ec8445aa9d/raw/0e67f776e6a126b45e5d6b0942082f2fd763c5bb/DeArrow%2520Privacy%2520Policy.md", "xpath": "//body", "text": "# Privacy Policy for DeArrow DeArrow is a browser extention that allows you to submit titles and thumbnails for YouTube videos and fetch titles and thumbnails that other people have already submitted.\nIt consists of one server that handles titles and timestamps of when thumbnails occur (they are screenshots at specific timestamps), and another server that acts as a cache of the thumbnail images themselves.\nAlso see [the terms of use](https://gist.github.com/ajayyy/9e8100f069348e0bc062641f34d6af12).\n## Log Files Almost all data that is collected through this extension can be downloaded from https://sponsor.ajay.app/database.\nSome more sensitive data such as votes and _hashed_ IPs are stored in a private database.\nThe only things I keep are:\n- Information you submit (submitted titles, thumbnails, reports, and votes on existing submissions)\n- A hashed version of your userID (a randomly generated value assigned when you first install the extension), only if a submission or vote has occurred\n- The time the submission happened\n- A hashed + salted version of your ip address for ratelimiting.\nThis process makes it close to impossible to retrieve the original value if they don't have access to the salt.\n- The name of your client (if using an extension, another port, etc.) The extension also makes requests to YouTube URLs to generate thumbnails and get metadata, such as video duration, of videos.\n# Requests sent to the server while using the extension Each time a video title or thumbnail is displayed on screen:\n- An anonymous request is sent asking for the submissions for that video -
