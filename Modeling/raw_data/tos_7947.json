uses cookies and similar technology on its websites for a variety of reasons.\nThis policy explains what cookies are and why we use them.\nWhen this policy refers to \u201ccookies\u201d, it refers to both cookies and similar technologies, which function in the same way as cookies.\nWhen this policy refers to \u201ccomputers\u201d, it refers to computers and all other devices used for accessing the internet.\nThis Cookie Policy applies to any and all of our websites (the \u201cWebsite\", \u201cWebsites\u201d), meaning any website operated by or on behalf of DOUBLEGIS or its subsidiaries, regardless of how you access the network.</p>\n<p>This policy explains how cookies are used on DOUBLEGIS websites in general and how you can control the cookies that may be used on this site.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.\nInformation about cookies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What is a cookie?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer's browser from a website's server and is stored on your computer's hard drive.\nEach website or third party service provider used by the website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website or third party service provider to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites or other third party service providers.&nbsp.\nA cookie will contain some anonymous information such as a unique identifier and the site name and some digits and numbers.\nIt allows a website to remember things like your preferences or what's in your shopping basket.\nA cookie may be a session cookie, that is, a cookie that remains on your browser while you are logged on to a particular web site and then disappears when you close your browser, or it may be a persistent cookie, a cookie that remains on your browser over a period of time.</p>\n<p>You can learn more about cookies, generally, at www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>\n<p>We use both session cookies and persistent cookies on our websites.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What is a browser?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A browser is an application that allows you to surf the internet.&nbsp.\nThe most common browsers are Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari.\nMost browsers are secure and offer quick and easy ways to delete information like cookies.</p>\n<p>You can choose how cookies are handled by your device via your browser settings.\nThe most popular browsers allow users to a) accept all cookies, b) to notify you when a cookie is issued, or c) to not receive cookies at any time.\nIf you choose not to receive cookies at any time, the website may not function properly and certain services will not be provided, spoiling your experience of the website.&nbsp.\nEach browser is different, so check the \"Help\" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies and personal information </strong>\n</p>\n<p>Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your email address or other personal information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at one of our sites.\nOnce you choose to provide a web page with personal information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.\nA cookie is like an identification card.\nIt is unique to your computer and can only be read by the server that gave it to you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nOur cookies and how we use cookies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use cookies to enhance the functionality of the websites understanding sites usage and improving the content, the performance of our websites and offerings on our sites.\nWe also may use cookies to offer you products and services.</p>\n<p>Typically, we use cookies to deliver the following services throughout the pages of our websites.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to help us maintain security and verify your details whilst you use the website as you navigate from page to page, which enables you to avoid having to re-enter your details each time you enter a new page;</li>\n<li>to recognize that you may have requested that we remember your username and password so you don't need to enter your details each time you visit the site;</li>\n<li>To collect and compile anonymous, aggregated information for statistical and evaluation purposes to help us understand how users use the website and help us improve the structure of our website.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We don't list every single cookie used by name - but for each type of cookie we tell you how you can control its use.</p>\n<p>Types of cookie that may be used during your visit to the websites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Personalization cookies - </strong>These cookies are used to recognize repeat visitors to the website and in conjunction with other information we hold to attempt to record specific browsing information (that is, about the way you arrive at the website, pages you view, options you select, information you enter and the path you take through the website).\nThese are used to recommend content we think you will be interested in based on what you are looked at before.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>&nbsp;Site management cookies - </strong>These are used to maintain your identity or session on the website.\nFor instance, where our websites run on more than one server, we use a cookie to ensure that you are sent information by one specific server (otherwise you may log in or out unexpectedly).\nWe may use similar cookies when you vote in opinion polls to ensure that you can only vote once, and to ensure that you can use our commenting functionality when not logged in (to ensure you don't see comments you've reported as abusive, for instance, or don't vote comments up/down more than once).\nThese cookies cannot be turned off individually but you could change your browser setting to refuse all cookies if you do not wish to accept them.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Third parties cookies and analytics -</strong> DOUBLEGIS and our advertisers use cookies to serve you with advertisements that we believe are relevant to you and your interests.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Analytics </strong>\n</p>\n<p>Google.Analytycs, Yandex.Metrika, VisualWebsiteOptimizer provide anonymized statistical information for us.\nIt processes IP addresses and information from cookies used on our websites so we know how many page views we have, how many users we have, what browsers they are using (so we can target our resources in the right way to maximize compatibility for the majority of our users) and, in some cases, in which country, city or region they are located.\nSome of the IP address and information from cookies gathered by this provider is processed by it outside the European Economic Area and we confirm that it satisfies the European Union data protection requirements.\nPlease read their privacy policies to ensure that you are comfortable with the manner in which they use cookies.</p>\n<p>If you would like to opt out some of Analytics cookies, please do so by clicking on the links below:</p>\n<p>Google Analytics: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout </p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third party advertising</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Advertisers sometimes use their own cookies to provide you with targeted advertising.\nFor example, advertisers may use a profile they have built on sites that you have previously visited to present you with more relevant advertisements during your visit to Website.\nWe believe that it is useful to our users to see advertisements that are more relevant to their interests.\nThe placing of these cookies on your device may enable you to be identified across multiple websites and you should consult the privacy policies of our advertisers, partners and advertising service providers to understand how they collect and use your data.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\nBlocking cookies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies.\nThese links explain how you can control cookies via your browser - remember that if you turn off cookies in your browser then these settings apply to all websites not just this one:</p>\n<p>Internet Explorer http://support.microsoft.com/kb/278835 (this page links to

http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en-GB&amp;answer=95647</p>\n<p>Blocking all cookies will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites<strong>.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nDeleting cookies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You can also delete cookies already stored on your computer following the instructions provided by your browser.\nAgain, doing this may have a negative impact on the usability of many websites.</p>\n<p>You can learn more about deleting cookies at http://www.aboutcookies.org/page-2 .</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.\nAuditing our websites</strong>\n</p>\n<p>On a quarterly basis, we conduct an audit of all cookies being used across the website portfolio.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nFurther information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our cookies policy may be amended from time to time without notice so it is important that you regularly check this policy so you are fully aware of any changes or updates.</p>\n<p>To contact us about this policy, you may email inf@2gis.ru.\nWhen emailing please indicate which of our sites you question relates to.</p>\n<p>Policy Last Updated: Version as of July
