you receive a marketing or promotional email from us, you may click the \u2018Unsubscribe\u2019 link contained in the bottom of every email to \"opt out\" from future promotional emails.\nHowever, we may continue to send you emails about your account and for other purposes related to customer service.\nYou may also unsubscribe from such emails at any time by emailing us at support@vpnelf.com and telling us you would like to \"unsubscribe from marketing emails.\"</p>\n<p>We also send product awareness emails to new customers.\nThese emails include application tips and other information intended to educate VPNElf account subscribers about the uses and fundamentals of a VPN.</p>\nTransactional Emails\nAccount\n<p>To keep you updated on any changes or alerts related to your account, we

our security and privacy practices.\nIn addition, access to user or subscriber personal information is restricted to those who need to know such information to perform their job functions.</p>\n<p>We

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is effective as of May 25, 2018.\nThis regulation broadens the privacy rights that EU individuals have over how their personal data is collected, processed, and maintained.</p>\nDedicated IP Addresses\n<p>We want our customers to be aware that while we offered packages with dedicated IP addresses in the past, these packages were not designed for anonymity, and should not be used for that purpose.\nDedicated IP addresses are built for security and region-switching, and are assigned to one customer for their exclusive use.\nFor additional privacy and anonymity, we recommend switching to our current VPN packages that use our shared IP network.\nThese plans give you access to more regions and provide another layer of privacy.\nIf you\u2019re a current customer on a legacy plan with a dedicated IP, you can upgrade your account at no charge.\nPlease contact support to change your account.</p>\nPrivacy Settings and
