Services uses several types of cookies including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Session cookies: Session cookies are created temporarily in your browser's subfolder while you are visiting a website and are automatically deleted when you leave the website.</li>\n<li>Persistent cookies: In contrast to session cookies, persistent cookies are re-activated when you return to the same website, and remain in your browser's subfolder until they expire (usually after 12 months).</li>\n<li>Secure cookies: Secure cookies are a type of cookie which is transmitted over encrypted HTTP connection.\nWhen setting the cookie, the Secure attribute instructs the browser that the cookie should only be returned to the application over encrypted connections.</li>\n<li>Third party cookies: A third party cookie is one that is placed on your hard drive by a website from a domain other than the one you are visiting (e.g.\nwhen the website features content, such as ads, from a third-party domain).\nThird party cookies are set so that a site can remember something about you at a later time.\nThese cookies are set by third parties and we do not control how they are set.</li>\n<li>SameSite cookies: SameSite cookies allow servers to assert that a cookie ought not to be sent along with cross-site requests, which provides some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks.\nSameSite cookies may not be supported by all browsers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>HOW CAN YOU OBJECT TO COOKIES BEING PLACED ON YOUR DEVICE?</strong>\n</p>\n<p> You can control how cookies are set on your device by using your

settings</strong>\n</p>\n<p> You can authorise, refuse or disable website cookies by changing your browser settings.\nIf you disable a cookie already installed on your device or browser, it will not be active any more, but it will not disappear from your device or browser until the end of its lifespan.\n</p>\n<p> Each browser is configured differently.\nYou should follow the instructions given by the publisher of your browser.\nIf you use different devices, make sure you configure the settings of the corresponding browser according to your preferences.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Mobile device settings</strong>\n</p>\n<p> Your mobile device may provide settings that allow you to express the choice not to have information about your use of mobile ads used for interest-based advertising
