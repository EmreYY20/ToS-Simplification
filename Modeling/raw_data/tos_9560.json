trust of the schools and school districts that have chosen our services.\nWe work hard to meet or exceed legal compliance requirements and to stay abreast of the fast-changing privacy law landscape.\nWe are committed to being a trusted partner in education and to help schools meet their own compliance obligations under the applicable privacy laws, such as GDPR, COPPA and other local laws.</p>\n<p>The Student Privacy Pledge</p>\n<p>Soundtrap for Education is a signatory of&nbsp;the Student Privacy Pledge&nbsp;(the \u201cPledge\u201d), an industry standard of privacy principles for providers of K\u201312 educational services.\nAs part of our commitment to the Pledge, we follow certain core principles with respect to our collection and use of student personal information, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We collect, maintain, use or share student personal information only for purposes for which we were authorized.</li>\n<li>We disclose clearly in contracts and/or privacy policies what types of student personal information we collect and the purposes for which it is used and shared.</li>\n<li>We support access to and correction of student personal information by the student or their authorized parent.</li>\n<li>We maintain a comprehensive security program that is reasonably designed to protect the security, privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of student personal information through the use of appropriate safeguards.</li>\n<li>We require our vendors that process student personal information on our behalf to implement safeguards at least as protective as the commitments we undertake.</li>\n<li>We do not sell student personal information.</li>\n<li>We do not use or disclose student personal information for behavioral targeting of advertisements to students.</li>\n<li>We do not build a personal profile of a student other than for supporting authorized educational purposes or as authorized by the parent/student.</li>\n<li>We will not make material changes to our privacy policies without notice or choice.</li>\n<li>We do not knowingly retain student personal information beyond the time period necessary or as authorized by the parent/student.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our collection and use of student personal information is governed by our privacy notices, terms of use, agreements signed with a school or school district, and by applicable laws like the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), and other local student privacy laws, of which a few key ones are highlighted below.\n</p>\n<p>Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) </p>\n<p>Soundtrap for Education is designed to meet our responsibilities to protect personal information from the students' educational records under FERPA.\nWe are committed to helping schools ensure compliance with the FERPA regulations to protect the confidentiality of educational records, provide parents and eligible students the opportunity to access and review such records, and limit further disclosure of personal information only as necessary to support the schools educational purposes.</p>\n<p>Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</p>\n<p>Soundtrap for Education is designed to comply with COPPA.\nConsistent with the COPPA regulations, we rely on the school to provide appropriate consent and authorization for a student under 13 to use our services and for Soundtrap for Education to collect personal information from each student.\nWe use and process student personal information for the purpose of providing the educational services to the school and do not collect or retain student personal information for longer than is necessary to provide the Service.\nWe provide the school the opportunity to review and delete the personal information collected from their students, and we work with schools to provide parents the same level of access, upon request.\n</p>\n<p>California Student Online Personal Information Protection Act (SOPIPA) and California Assembly Bill 1584</p>\n<p>Soundtrap for Education is designed to comply with SOPIPA and California Assembly Bill 1584.\nWe do not use student personal information for targeted advertising purposes.\nWe do not use collected information to amass a profile of a K-12 student except in furtherance of K-12 school purposes.\nWe never sell student personal information unless the sale is part of a corporate transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other sale of assets, in which case we make efforts to ensure the successor entity honors the privacy commitments made in this policy and/or we will notify you of such a sale and provide you an opportunity to opt out by deleting your account before the data transfer occurs.\n</p>\n<p>New York Education Law \u00a72-d and Regulation 121</p>\n<p>Soundtrap for Education is committed to protecting the confidentiality, integrity and security of student personal information, consistent with the provisions of New York Education Law \u00a72-d.\nThe New York State Board of Regents recently approved new regulations that provide further guidance for New York Education Law \u00a72-d, which becomes effective July 1, 2020 (namely, Part 121 of the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education).\nSoundtrap for Education is designed to align with the finalized regulations.\nUpon request, we will append a Parents\u2019 Bill of Rights to our agreement with any New York State school district and provide a copy of Soundtrap\u2019s Data Security and Privacy Plan.\n</p>\n<p>Last Updated:&nbsp;September 2020</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "created_at": "2023-09-04 23:06:57.249274", "updated_at": "2023-09-04 23:07:04.425671"},

CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and we agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>\n<p>\n<br>23.3 Arbitration</p>\n<p>If you are located in, are based in, have offices in, or do business in a jurisdiction in which this Section 23.3 is enforceable, the following mandatory arbitration provisions apply to you:</p>\n<p>23.3.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration</p>\n<p>You and we&nbsp;agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and us&nbsp;arising in connection with or relating in any way to the Agreement or to your relationship with us&nbsp;as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreement) will be determined by mandatory binding individual arbitration.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreement.</p>\n<p>23.3.2 Exceptions</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding clause 23.3.1 above, you and we&nbsp;both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a small claims court (2) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (3) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (4) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</p>\n<p>23.3.3 Arbitration rules</p>\n<p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and us&nbsp;will be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the \u201cICC\u201d) then in force (the \u201cICC Rules\u201d) by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the ICC Rules, as modified by the Agreement, and will be administered by the International Court of Arbitration of the ICC.<br>\n<br>Any arbitration will be conducted in the English language and unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of a member state of the European Union or any other jurisdiction, the law to be applied in any arbitration shall be the law of the relevant state or country listed in clause 23.1, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.</p>\n<p>23.3.4 Time for filing</p>\n<p>Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration within ONE (1) YEAR after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission, or default giving rise to the claim.\nand there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period.\nIf applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.</p>\n<p>23.3.5 Notice.\nprocess</p>\n<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nOur&nbsp;address for Notice is: Katarinav\u00e4gen 15, 116 45 STOCKHOLM.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or we&nbsp;may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or us shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, we shall pay you (1) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (2) the last written settlement amount offered by us&nbsp;in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator\u2019s award.\nor (3) \u20ac1,000 euro, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator\u2019s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.</p>\n<p>\n<br>Except as required to enforce the arbitrator\u2019s decision and award, neither you nor we shall make any public announcement or public comment or originate any publicity concerning the arbitration, including the fact that the parties are in dispute, the existence of the arbitration, or any decision or award of the arbitrator.<br>\n<br>23.3.6 Modifications<br>\n<br>In the event that we make any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to our&nbsp;address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to our&nbsp;address for Notice, in which case your Soundtrap\u00ae account shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, shall survive.<br>\n<br>23.3.7 Enforceability<br>\n<br>If the class action waiver in section 23.2 is found to be unenforceable in arbitration or if any part of this section 23.3 is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this section 23.3 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 23.1 shall govern any action arising out of or related to the Agreement.</p>\n<p>24.\nEntire agreement, third party beneficiaries</p>\n<p>Other than as stated in this section or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and us, this&nbsp;Agreement together with and any additional terms you agree to from time to time, constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to your use of the Service and supersede any prior agreement with respect to the same subject matter.\nAny modifications to the Agreement other than by us as permitted by Section 3&nbsp;are prohibited unless made in writing between you and us.</p>\n<p>As noted previously, however, certain aspects of your use of the Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, when access to the Service is sold via a third party, together with other services, or when you have agreed to terms and conditions of Third Party Services.\nTo the extent that there is any irreconcilable conflict between any such additional terms and these Terms of Use, the additional terms shall prevail.</p>\n<p>25.\nExport control</p>\n<p>Our products may be subject to U.S.\nexport and re-export control laws

Arbitration</p>\n<p>If you are located in, are based in, have offices in, or do business in a jurisdiction in which this Section 19.3 is enforceable, the following mandatory arbitration provisions apply to you:</p>\n<p>19.3.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration</p>\n<p>You and we&nbsp;agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and us&nbsp;arising in connection with or relating in any way to the Agreement or to your relationship with us&nbsp;as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreement) will be determined by mandatory binding individual arbitration.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreement.</p>\n<p>19.3.2 Exceptions</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding clause 19.3.1 above, you and we&nbsp;both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a small claims court (2) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (3) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (4) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</p>\n<p>19.3.3 Arbitration rules</p>\n<p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and us&nbsp;will be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the \u201cICC\u201d) then in force (the \u201cICC Rules\u201d) by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the ICC Rules, as modified by the Agreement, and will be administered by the International Court of Arbitration of the ICC.<br>\n<br>Any arbitration will be conducted in the English language and unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of a member state of the European Union or any other jurisdiction, the law to be applied in any arbitration shall be the law of the relevant state or country listed in clause 23.1, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.</p>\n<p>19.3.4 Time for filing</p>\n<p>Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration within ONE (1) YEAR after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission, or default giving rise to the claim.\nand there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period.\nIf applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.</p>\n<p>19.3.5 Notice.\nprocess</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nOur&nbsp;address for Notice is: Soundtrap AB, Katarinav\u00e4gen 15, 116 45, STOCKHOLM, Sweden.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or we&nbsp;may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or us shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, we shall pay you (1) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (2) the last written settlement amount offered by us&nbsp;in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator\u2019s award.\nor (3) \u20ac1,000.00, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator\u2019s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.</p>\n<p>\n<br>Except as required to enforce the arbitrator\u2019s decision and award, neither you nor we shall make any public announcement or public comment or originate any publicity concerning the arbitration, including the fact that the parties are in dispute, the existence of the arbitration, or any decision or award of the arbitrator.<br>\n<br>19.3.6 Modifications<br>\n<br>In the event that we make any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to our&nbsp;address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to our&nbsp;address for Notice, in which case your Soundtrap\u00ae account shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, shall survive.<br>\n<br>19.3.7 Enforceability<br>\n<br>If the class action waiver in section 19.2 is found to be unenforceable in arbitration or if any part of this section 19.3 is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this section 19.3 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 19.1 shall govern any action arising out of or related to the Agreement.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Entire agreement, third party beneficiaries</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Other than as stated in this section or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and us, this Agreement together with and any additional terms you agree to from time to time, constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to your and your End Users use of the Service and supersede any prior agreement between you and us

a representative with actual authority to bind us to those modifications.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>As noted previously, however, certain aspects of your use of the Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, when access to the Service is sold via a Reseller together with other services, or when you have agreed to terms and conditions of Third Party Services.\nTo the extent that there is any irreconcilable conflict between any such additional terms and these Terms of Use, the additional terms shall prevail.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Export
