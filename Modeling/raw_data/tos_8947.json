Library Computers &amp.\nWiFi <p>The Kenosha Public Library understands that for many people, library computers are the only way to connect to the digital world.\nAccording to the 2020 census, ~<em>17%</em> of the residents within the City of Kenosha lack&nbsp;access to high-speed internet and&nbsp;a home computer.\nWhile no computer system is 100% secure, to help ensure your digital privacy and online security, KPL has taken the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Installed \"reboot to restore\" software on all public computers.\nAll personal information, logins, and any installed software are wiped from the computer when it's rebooted.</li>\n<li>Installed and maintain anti-malware software on library-owned computers.</li>\n<li>Ensured that all network traffic on library-owned computers is encrypted from point of origin to its final destination (aka end-to-end encryption).</li>\n<li>Encrypted the data on all servers, staff workstations, and staff laptops.</li>\n<li>Disabled all unused physical networking ports.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, we are in the development of a fully secure WiFi network for patrons.\nIn the future, patrons will be able to connect to the Library's wireless network via their library card number to have a more secure connection at every library location.</p> Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) <p>The Kenosha Public Library uses&nbsp;Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID), opens a new window&nbsp;for inventory control and systems automation.\nThis system uses tags to help with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Checking out of items;</li>\n<li>Checking in and sorting returned items (such as the automated returns system at Northside).\nand</li>\n<li>Allowing&nbsp;staff to conduct quicker inventories of items on the shelves.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The tags are encoded with only the item's barcode number and do not contain any personal information or other identifying information.\nWith this system in place, the library has been able to retrain and deploy staff to other functions such as the bookmobiles, adult &amp.\nyouth events, and home delivery services.</p> Visits to MyKPL.info <p>When you visit mykpl.info, the following basic information is automatically received and stored by the web servers hosting mykpl.info:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The originating Internet Protocol (IP) address;</li>\n<li>The internet domain
