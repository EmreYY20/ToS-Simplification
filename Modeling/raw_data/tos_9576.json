\u201cWHOIS\u201d.\nWHOIS is designed to provide limited information concerning Domain Names.</p>\n<p>WHOIS has built-in privacy protection options, which can be used to limit the personal information available through the WHOIS system.\nFor Registrants who are individuals (e.g.\nas opposed to organizations), the privacy protection options are turned on by default, and only limited personal information is available to third parties when they search the WHOIS system for a Domain Name that you have registered.\nIf you turn your privacy protection option off, more of your personal information will be available through the WHOIS system.\nYour privacy protections can be changed by contacting your Registrar.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>When your privacy protection is turned on, the following information is visible:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Domain Name;</li>\n<li>Domain Name status;</li>\n<li>Creation date;</li>\n<li>Expiry date;</li>\n<li>Updated date;</li>\n<li>Registrar name.\nand</li>\n<li>Registrar number.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>When your privacy protection is turned OFF, the following information is visible</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Registrant Information includes:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Registrant name;</li>\n<li>Mailing address, e-mail address, phone number and fax number;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Domain Name Information includes:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Domain Name;</li>\n<li>Domain Name status;</li>\n<li>Creation date;</li>\n<li>Expiry date;</li>\n<li>Updated date;</li>\n<li>Registrar name.\nand</li>\n<li>Registrar number.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Administrative Contact Information and Technical Contact Information includes:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name;</li>\n<li>Mailing address;</li>\n<li>Phone;</li>\n<li>Fax.\nand</li>\n<li>E-mail.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are a non-individual Registrant, the information that will be made available through the WHOIS system will be the same as an individual Registrant with their privacy protection turned OFF.\nNon-individual Registrants may request to CIRA, in writing, that the information described above not be disclosed to the public via the WHOIS.\nIn such a written request, the non-individual Registrant must certify that it has a legitimate need to protect the privacy of its information, which need is greater than that of other CIRA Registrants who are not individuals, because the nature of that Registrant\u2019s operations or activities is such that disclosure of its information via the WHOIS would be likely to cause harm to individuals or to that Registrant.</p>\n<p>CIRA retains the discretion to determine in any case whether a non-individual Registrant meets the criteria and will be permitted to opt out of standard disclosure of information in the WHOIS.\nIf CIRA accedes to the request, the non-individual Registrant\u2019s WHOIS information will only be disclosed thereafter in accordance with the terms for disclosure applicable to individual Registrants.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Domain Name Disputes and Law Enforcement</strong>\n</p>\n<p>CIRA has established policies on the disclosure of registration information for Domain Name disputes and law enforcement purposes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(i) Domain Name Disputes</strong>\n</p>\n<p>CIRA has implemented two policies, entitled Registration Information Access Rules and Procedures and Request for Disclosure of Registrant Information \u2013 Rules and Procedures, that address disclosures in the course of Domain Name disputes.</p>\n<p>Under the Registration Information Access Rules and Procedures policy, CIRA will provide a person, who requests in the applicable form, a list of the .CA Domain Names registered in the name of a Registrant or registered in the name of the same Registrant as a Domain Name identified by the requester, even where the identity of the Registrant is unknown.\nThis is done to facilitate bona fide rights holders to determine infringements of intellectual property rights.</p>\n<p>Under the Request for Disclosure of Registrant Information \u2013 Rules and Procedures, CIRA may provide a person, who requests in the applicable form, certain Registrant information not publicly available through CIRA\u2019s WHOIS.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information disclosed to requesters includes:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The name of the Registrant;</li>\n<li>The mailing address and e-mail address of the Registrant;</li>\n<li>The name of the Registrant\u2019s Administrative Contact and Technical Contact.\nand</li>\n<li>The mailing address and e-mail address of the Administrative Contact and Technical Contact</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a Domain Name that you have registered is subject to a proceeding under the CIRA Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy, your personal information may also be disclosed to the relevant Dispute Resolution Service Provider to facilitate the dispute resolution process.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(ii) Requests from Law Enforcement</strong>\n</p>\n<p>CIRA has implemented a policy entitled Request for Disclosure of Registrant Information for Law Enforcement and National Security Agencies \u2013 Rules and Procedures that addresses disclosures for law enforcement purposes.\nUnder this policy, CIRA may provide a Law Enforcement Requester, who requests in the applicable form, certain Registrant information not publicly available through CIRA\u2019s WHOIS.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information disclosed to Law Enforcement Requesters includes:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The name of the Registrant;</li>\n<li>The mailing address and e-mail address of the Registrant;</li>\n<li>The name of the Registrant\u2019s Administrative Contact and Technical Contact.\nand</li>\n<li>The mailing address and e-mail address of the Administrative Contact and Technical Contact.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>(iii) Notification</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If a Registrant\u2019s information is disclosed pursuant to the Request for Disclosure of Registrant Information \u2013 Rules and Procedures, or the Request for Disclosure of Registrant Information for Law Enforcement and National Security Agencies \u2013 Rules and Procedures, we shall, unless prohibited by law, not less than thirty (30) and not more than sixty (60) days after disclosure of the personal information, use reasonable efforts to send an e-mail to the Registrant and Administrative Contact&nbsp.\nfor the relevant Domain Name Registration(s) indicating:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>what parts of the information were disclosed.\nand</li>\n<li>to whom it was disclosed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Service Provider Arrangements</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may transfer (or otherwise make available) your personal information to third parties who provide

information to any third party service provider, CIRA enters into an agreement with the service provider pursuant to which it is required to use the personal information solely for the purpose of providing the service and to maintain security and privacy measures at least as stringent as those of CIRA.\nOur service providers are only given the information they need to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose personal information for their own marketing or other purposes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Legal</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In the event that personal
