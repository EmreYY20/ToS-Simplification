equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property rights.</p>\n<p>Arbitration will be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\").\nIn the event the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.\nThe rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms.\nThe AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (\"AAA Rules\") governing the arbitration are available online at&nbsp;www.adr.org&nbsp;or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator.</p>\n<p>If the claim is for $10,000 or less, the party initiating the arbitration may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.\nIn the case of an in-person hearing, the proceedings will be conducted at a location which is reasonably convenient for both parties with due consideration of the ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.\nIf the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by the arbitration institution.</p>\n<p>Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be limited to those fees set forth in the AAA Rules with the remainder paid by Ellation.\nIf the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the arbitration is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\nIn such case, you agree to reimburse Ellation for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Ellation.\nThe dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.\nThe arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute.\nThe arbitrator will have the authority to award all remedies available under applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and the Terms.\nThe arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.\nThe award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Ellation.</p>\n<p>You and Ellation waive any constitutional and statutory rights to go to court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury.\nRather, you and Ellation elect to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration.\nIn any litigation between you and Ellation over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, you and Ellation waive all rights to a jury trial, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>\n<p>YOU AND ELLATION AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nIf this specific provision is found to unenforceable, then the entirety of this provision shall be null and void, and all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as specified in Section 13 above.</p>\n<p>YOU MAY OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.\nIf you do so, neither you nor Ellation can force the other to arbitrate.\nTo opt-out, you must notify Ellation in writing no later than thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement.\nYour notice must include your name and address, and the email address you used to set up your Crunchyroll account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt-out of this arbitration agreement.\nYou must send your opt-out notice to one of the following physical or email addresses: Ellation, LLC., ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out, 444 Bush Street, San Francisco, CA
