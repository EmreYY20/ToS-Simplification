<p>GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents' data is protected by companies and enhances the control the EU residents have, over their personal data.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> What is personal data? <p>Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual.\nGDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person.\nPersonal data extends beyond a person's name or email address.\nSome examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.\nThe Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.\n</li>\n<li>Personal data should only be collected to fulfill a specific purpose and it should only be used for that purpose.\nOrganizations must specify why they need personal data when they collect it.\n</li>\n<li>Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfill its purpose.</li>\n<li>People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data.\nThey can also request a copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.\n</li>\n</ul> Why is GDPR important? <p>GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals' personal data that they collect and process.\nIt also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach.\nBeyond these facts, it's simply the right thing to do.\nAt Lili we strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.</p> Individual Data Subject's Rights - Data Access, Portability and Deletion <p>We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject rights requirements of GDPR.\nWe process or store all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors.\nWe do store all conversation and personal data for up to 6 years unless your account is deleted.\nIn which case, we dispose of all data in accordance with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, but we will not hold it longer than 60 days.</p>\n<p>We are aware that if you are working with EU customers, you need to be able to provide them with the ability to access, update, retrieve, and remove personal data.\nWe got you!
