Partners:</b> Some of our Services will be provided with the assistance of third parties.\nWe may also share some personal data with our partners in particular so as to deliver you a better service

property.\n(d) to protect your rights, property or personal safety or that of others.\n(e) to investigate fraud and (f) to protect the security or integrity of our Services.\n</p>\n<p>

consent.\n</p> VII.\nHow Your Personal Data Is Transferred Globally <p> 1.\nWe leverage our resources and servers around the world to provide Services.\nWe have data centres in the U.S., France,

Services.\n</p>\n<p> 2.\nPlease note that different countries or regions offer different levels of data protection.\nThis means that your personal data could be stored in a country that offers a level of protection that may, in certain instances, be less protective of your personal data than the country or region in which you are located.\nHowever, in such cases, we will take measures to ensure that the personal data we collect is processed in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable laws, and that your personal data is adequately protected.\nFor example, we might ask your permission to transfer your personal data across borders, and we will implement adequate security measures (such as encryption and de-identification where feasible) and sign the necessary data transmission/sharing agreements with the recipients of your personal data prior to the transfer taking place.\nWe will also specifically ensure that we comply with laws that require us to store data locally within a specific country or region.\n</p> VIII.\nHow We Protect Your Personal Data <p> 1.\nThe security of your personal data is very important to us.\nWe have taken reasonably practical, technical and organisational measures in accordance with industry standards to protect personal data collected in connection with our Service and prevent it from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access.\nHowever, please note that while we have taken reasonable measures to protect your personal data, no websites, Internet transmissions, computer systems or wireless connections are absolutely secure.\nIn particular: </p>\n<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022 Where appropriate, we will de-identify your personal data to mitigate the risk that other organisations or individuals may identify you on the basis of that personal data.\nWe may also implement full security encryption during storage and transmission to prevent your personal data from unauthorised access, use or disclosure (such as by using SSL to encrypt many Services).\nWe regularly review practices regarding personal data collection, storage and processing (including physical security measures) to prevent unauthorised access to or tampering with our various systems and your personal data.\n</p>\n<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022 We only allow our employees and personnel of authorised service companies to access such personal data on a need-to-know basis, in order to process such personal data or provide relevant Services to you.\nThese employees and external personnel are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations.\nIf they fail to perform these obligations, they may be held liable and/or their relationship with OnePlus may be terminated.\n</p>\n<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022 When transmitting and storing special categories of personal data, we use extra security measures, such as encryption of the transmitted content.\nWe also use technical measures to process your personal biometric information so that we only need to store essential data (such as basic parameters necessary to identify a person, but not the raw facial and fingerprint data).\n</p>\n<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022 We carefully select our business partners and service providers and ensure that they are sufficiently bound to protect personal data and will be subject to privacy audits and assessments.\n</p>\n<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022 We conduct security and privacy protection training, testing and other activities to enhance employee awareness of and proficiency in personal data protection.\n</p>\n<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022 We use international and industry-recognised standards to protect your personal data and actively pursue relevant security and privacy protection accreditation.\n</p>\n<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022 We promise not to sell personal data to any third party and guarantees the legitimate and fair use of user information only to the extent permitted by law.\n</p>\n<p> 2.\nIn case of a personal data security incident, we will act in accordance with applicable law and notify you and/or the competent data protection authority of any such security incident where required, and take measures to mitigate any risks arising therefrom.\n</p> IX.\nYour Rights Regarding Your Personal Data <p> 1.\nSubject to applicable laws in your jurisdiction, you may have specific rights regarding your personal data.\nThis may include the following rights in particular: </p>\n<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>\u2022 The right to be informed:</b>

jurisdictions might entitle you to refer the complaint to the relevant regulatory authority if you are not satisfied with the response you received.\n</p>\n<p> 6.\nIn principle, we do not charge a fee for responding to your reasonable request.\nHowever, for multiple and repetitive requests that exceed a reasonable limit, we may charge a reasonable fee to cover some of our costs, depending on the nature of the request.\nWe are entitled to refuse requests in whole or in part, and we may refuse requests that are manifestly unfounded, unreasonably repetitive or that require disproportionate technical effort (for instance, requests that require the development of new systems).\nIn addition, we may not respond to requests that directly concern significant issues of public interest or may cause serious damage to the legitimate rights and interests of you or other individuals or entities.\n</p> X.\nHow We Process Children's Personal Data <p> 1.\nOur Services are mainly intended for adults.\nA child should not use our Services without his/her legal guardian's consent.\nWe treat anyone less than 18 years of age (or the equivalent minimum age for full legal capacity in the relevant jurisdiction) as a child.\n</p>\n<p> 2.\nIf we discover that a child's personal data has been collected, we will delete the corresponding data as soon as possible.\n</p>\n<p> 3.\nIf you believe that we might have any personal data concerning a child, please contact us using the \"Contact Us\" section.\n</p> XI.\nThird-Party Websites <p> 1.\nOnePlus Services may contain links to third-party websites, products and services.\nYou can choose whether to access websites or accept products and services provided by third parties or not.\nFor example, the \"Follow us\" function on our official website provides links to our official social media accounts (such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and Twitter) where you can view marketing or promotional information published by OnePlus .\n</p>\n<p> 2.\nWe do not control third-party privacy and data protection policies and do not accept any responsibility or liability for such policies.\nAt the same time, such third parties are not bound by this Privacy Notice.\nTherefore, before submitting personal data to third parties, we strongly recommend that you refer to the privacy protection practices of such third parties.\n</p> XII.\nHow This Privacy Notice Is Updated <p> We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Notice from time to time.\nWe will, as appropriate, send you notifications of material updates to

ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THIS LIMITATION IS REASONABLE GIVEN THE BENEFITS OF THE SITE AND YOU WILL ACCEPT SUCH RISK AND/OR INSURE ACCORDINGLY.\n</p>\n<p>15.2 If, notwithstanding the other provisions of these Terms of Use, OnePlus is found to be liable to you for any damage or loss which arises out of or is in any way connected with your use of the Site or any Content, THE COLLECTIVE LIABILITY OF ONEPLUS, ITS AFFILIATES, AND THEIR LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OFFICERS, AND DIRECTORS shall in no event exceed the greater of (I) us$100.00.\nOR (II) THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO

Law.\nJurisdiction.\nLimitation on Time to File Claims <p>17.1 All matters arising out of or relating to the Site and these Terms of Use, and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), are governed by and construed in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) and (only to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of Article XVIII below and the substantive and procedural provisions of the FAA) the internal laws of the State of Texas, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Texas or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of Texas.\nThe arbitrator will not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving OnePlus to which you are not a party.\nOther than claims that must be resolved through binding arbitration (or that may be brought in small claims court), any disputes relating to these Terms of Use or the Site will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Dallas County, Texas.\nthe parties consent to personal and exclusive jurisdiction in these courts and waive any objection to such jurisdiction and venue.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, other than claims that must be resolved through binding arbitration (or that may be brought in small claims court), OnePlus reserves the right to institute proceedings and/or apply for injunctive remedies (or any equivalent type of urgent legal relief) against the user in the courts having jurisdiction in the place where the user has its seat or in any jurisdiction where harm to OnePlus is occurring.\n</p>\n<p>17.2 These Terms of Use will not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded.\n</p>\n<p>17.3 ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR THE SITE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES.\nOTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.\n</p> XVIII.\nDispute Resolution and Binding Arbitration <p>READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM ONEPLUS.</p>\n<p>18.1 YOU AND ONEPLUS ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS FURTHER SET FORTH BELOW IN THIS SECTION 18) OR BEFORE A JURY, OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM.\nOTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT MAY ALSO BE UNAVAILABLE OR MAY BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.\n</p>\n<p>18.2 EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DISPUTES, OR CONTROVERSIES (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER PRE-EXISTING, PRESENT, OR FUTURE, AND INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, STATUTORY, CONSUMER PROTECTION, COMMON LAW, INTENTIONAL TORT, INJUNCTIVE, AND EQUITABLE CLAIMS) BETWEEN YOU AND ONEPLUS, ARISING FROM OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (I) THE SITE.\n(II) THESE TERMS OF USE AND PRIOR VERSIONS OF THESE TERMS OF USE, OR THE EXISTENCE, BREACH, TERMINATION, ENFORCEMENT, INTERPRETATION, SCOPE, WAIVER, OR VALIDITY THEREOF.\nOR (III) YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ONEPLUS (COLLECTIVELY, THE \u201cCOVERED DISPUTES\u201d), WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE COVERED DISPUTE OCCURRED OR ACCRUED BEFORE OR AFTER THE DATE YOU AGREED TO THESE TERMS OF USE.\n</p>\n<p>18.3 Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provision in these Terms of Use, this agreement to arbitrate evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and the FAA will govern its interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant thereto.\nIt is the intent of the parties to be bound by the provisions of the FAA for all purposes, that the applicable arbitration provider\u2019s rules shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law, and that the agreement to arbitrate be broadly interpreted.\n</p>\n<p>18.4 This agreement to arbitrate applies (i) whether your dispute is with OnePlus, its subsidiaries, affiliates, or parent company, or any suppliers or service providers involved with the Site or OnePlus\u2019s products and services, and their officers, directors, employees, agents, assigns, predecessors, and successors.\nand (ii) regardless of the legal theory on which you base your claim (such as breach of warranty, breach of contract, negligence, etc.).\nThis agreement to arbitrate will also be binding upon, and shall include any claims brought by, any other third parties, including, without limitation, your spouse, heirs, third-party beneficiaries, successors, and assigns, where their underlying claims arise out of or relate to a Covered Dispute.\n</p>\n<p>18.5 For Covered Disputes specifically relating to these Terms of Use or the Site, this agreement to arbitrate supersedes any terms regarding dispute resolution in any other agreement between you and OnePlus and contains the whole agreement between you and OnePlus with respect to any such disputes or claims.\n</p>\n<p>18.6 The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator and will be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures applicable to consumer disputes, and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those Rules, unless the parties agree to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (collectively, the \u201cJAMS Rules\u201d), except as modified by this Article XVIII.\nThe JAMS Rules are available online at www.jamsadr.com.\n</p>\n<p>18.7 For disputes arising in a jurisdiction where JAMS cannot or will not administer the arbitration, the parties shall be required to meet and confer to select a neutral arbitration provider.\nSuch an arbitration provider shall have operations in the state in which the dispute arises.\nIf the parties are unable to mutually agree upon an arbitration provider, then either party may invoke 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 5 to request that a court of competent jurisdiction appoint an arbitration provider with operations in the state in which the dispute arises.\nAny arbitration provider appointed by a court under 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 5 shall conduct arbitration solely on an individualized basis as set forth herein.\nOnce the parties mutually agree upon a neutral arbitration provider, or an arbitrator provider is appointed under 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 5, the ensuing arbitration shall commence pursuant to the rules of the designated arbitration provider, except as otherwise designated herein.\nOnce an arbitration provider is agreed upon or appointed, an arbitrator shall be appointed.\nThe arbitrator will be either (i) a retired judge, or (ii) an attorney licensed to practice law in the state where the arbitration is conducted with experience in the law underlying the dispute.\nThe arbitrator will be selected by the parties from the applicable arbitration provider\u2019s roster of arbitrators.\nIf the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator after a good faith meet and confer effort, then the applicable arbitration provider will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with its rules.\n</p>\n<p>18.8 We each agree that, as a condition precedent to initiating any arbitration or other legal proceedings, the parties shall make a good faith effort to resolve any Covered Dispute.\nIn the event that the parties are unable to resolve any Covered Dispute within a reasonable period (which, in any event, shall not exceed sixty (60) days), you or OnePlus may initiate an arbitration proceeding by (i) sending a written notice (entitled, and referred to herein as a, \u201cDemand for Arbitration\u201d) to the other party by mail.\nAND (ii) sending an electronic copy of the Demand for Arbitration to legal-usa@oneplus.com (if the Demand for Arbitration is from you) or to any email address that you provide to us when registering a OnePlus account or purchasing OnePlus product(s) or that you otherwise publish through the Site (if the Demand for Arbitration is from OnePlus).\nAny Demand for Arbitration that you send to OnePlus should be delivered to our principal place of business at: OnePlus, Attn: Legal Department, Re: Demand for Arbitration, Riverside Commons, 5000 Riverside Drive, Building 5, Suite 300, Irving, Texas 75039 USA.\n</p>\n<p>18.9 Unless the parties agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing will take place (at your option) in Dallas County, Texas or in the county in which you reside.\nHowever, subject to the approval of the arbitrator and OnePlus, you may decide whether you want the arbitration to be conducted instead: (i) based on written submissions without an oral hearing, or (ii) through a telephone or videoconference hearing.\n</p>\n<p>18.10 All issues in dispute are for the arbitrator to decide.\nExcept as otherwise specifically provided in Section 18.14 below, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the scope, arbitrability, and/or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate, whether a dispute can be arbitrated, or the interpretation of this agreement to arbitrate, including any unconscionability challenge or any other challenge to the effect that these arbitration provisions or these Terms of Use are void, voidable, or otherwise invalid.\nThe arbitrator shall, in accordance with the JAMS Rules, allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute, and shall enter orders as appropriate in order to protect the parties\u2019 trade secrets or confidential information.\nThe arbitrator will be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity.\nAny award of the arbitrator will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nThe arbitrator is not bound by decisions reached in separate arbitrations, and the arbitrator\u2019s decision shall be binding only upon the parties to the arbitration that are the subject of the decision.\nThe arbitrator shall award reasonable costs incurred in the arbitration to the prevailing party in accordance with the law(s) of the state in which arbitration is held.\n</p>\n<p>18.11 Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules unless otherwise stated in this agreement to arbitrate.\nIf the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, OnePlus will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration.\nIf the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the cost of accessing arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the cost of accessing a court for purposes of pursuing litigation on an individual basis, OnePlus will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of accessing arbitration from being prohibitive.\nIf the arbitrator decides that either the substance of your claim or the remedy you asked for is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, the parties will use the JAMS Rules to determine whether you or OnePlus is responsible for the filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees.\n</p>\n<p>18.12 The foregoing notwithstanding, if a party\u2019s claim is within the jurisdiction of a small claims court, either party may choose to take the claim to that court instead of arbitration as follows: (i) a party may take its claim to small claims court without first sending a Demand for Arbitration to the other party.\n(ii) a party that receives a Demand for Arbitration can, within thirty (30) calendar days after its receipt of the Demand for Arbitration (the \u201cForum Determination Period\u201d), send written notice (in the manner prescribed in Section 18.8 above) to the opposing party that it wants the case decided by a small claims court.\n(iii) after the expiration of the Forum Determination Period and after a case is filed with JAMS, but before the issuance of a Commencement Letter (as such term is defined in the JAMS Rules), a party can send written notice (in the manner prescribed in Section 18.8 above) to the opposing party and JAMS that it wants the case decided by a small claims court (after receiving this notice, JAMS will administratively close the case).\nand (iv) after the expiration of the Forum Determination Period, after a case is filed with JAMS, and after the issuance of a Commencement Letter, the parties may mutually agree in writing that the arbitration case should be closed and the dispute decided in small claims court.\nThe small-claims court proceeding will be limited solely to your individual dispute or controversy and will not be consolidated with any other action or conducted on a class-wide, representative, or class-action basis.\nNeither party may file a case with jams (for a claim that is within the jurisdiction of a small claims court) until after the expiration of the Forum Determination Period.\n</p>\n<p>18.13 The forgoing notwithstanding, you or OnePlus may file suit in court to address an intellectual property rights infringement claim (as set forth in Section 17.1 above).\n</p>\n<p>18.14 You agree to an arbitration on an individual basis.\nIn any dispute, NEITHER YOU NOR ONEPLUS WILL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST OTHER USERS OF THE SITE IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLAIM AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS MEMBER, IN A REPRESENATIVE CAPACITY, OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY.\nThe arbitral tribunal may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of you, the individual party seeking relief, and only to the extent necessary to provide relief that is warranted by your individual claim, and not any remedy that affects other users of the Site or third parties.\nThe arbitral tribunal has no power to consider the enforceability of this class arbitration waiver and any challenge to the class arbitration waiver may only be raised in a court of competent jurisdiction.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of the limitations set forth in this Section 18.14 as to a particular claim for relief or remedy (such as declaratory or injunctive relief), then that claim or remedy (and only that claim or remedy) must be severed from the arbitration and must be brought in the state or federal courts located in Dallas County, Texas or in the county in which you reside, while the remaining claims and remedies (such as individual damages or restitution) will still be resolved through binding arbitration.\n</p>\n<p>18.15 You can choose to reject the agreement to arbitrate (\u201copt out\u201d) by mailing us a written opt-out notice (\u201cOpt-Out Notice\u201d).\nThe Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than thirty (30) days after the date you accept these Terms of Use.\nYou must mail the Opt-Out Notice to OnePlus at the following address: OnePlus, Attn: Legal Department, Re: Opt-Out Notice, Riverside Commons, 5000 Riverside Drive, Building 5, Suite 300, Irving, Texas 75039 USA.\nYour Opt-Out Notice must include a statement that you intend to opt out of the arbitration agreement in the OnePlus Website Terms of Use, together with your name, address (including street number and address, city, state, and zip code), phone number, and any email address that you used in connection with registering a OnePlus account or purchasing OnePlus product(s) or that you otherwise published through the Site.\nYou must sign the Opt-Out Notice in order for it to be
