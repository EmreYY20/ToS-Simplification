children\u2019s information?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>NOTE TO PARENTS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Hasbro has developed its Services to be an enjoyable experience for users of all ages, including those under 13 (\u201cChild(ren)\u201d).\nPlease discuss this Policy with your Children so that they will better understand how to use the Services and the information they may be asked to provide when using the Services.\nHasbro believes that providing its visitors with accurate and adequate notice about the Services will inform choices and decisions about how to use the Services and will better protect its users' privacy.\nIf you have any questions or comments about this Policy, please contact us using the contact information provided at the end of this section.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Hasbro is committed to compliance with the <u>Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d)</u>, a federal law designed to protect Children online.\nWe take Children's privacy seriously and encourage parents to take an active role in protecting their Children's privacy and online experience at all times.\nAs shown on our website, we are Privacy Certified by ESRB for Kids, which indicates that our Services were subject to a third party review to ensure they restrict the collection and use of personal information in compliance with COPPA.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Hasbro may collect and store certain persistent identifiers (e.g., cookies, IP addresses, etc.) from Children without parental consent for the purpose of supporting the internal operations of the Services or as otherwise permitted under COPPA.</p>\n<p>Hasbro may collect and store other personal information about Children if this information is submitted by a Child with prior parental consent or by the parent or guardian of the Child.\nIf a Service is directed to children under COPPA, we may ask users to verify their dates of birth before collecting any personal information from them.\nThose users that indicate they are Children are either blocked from the activity or taken through a parental consent process.</p>\n<p>Hasbro may collect and store the following types of personal information about a Child when submitted by a Child with prior parental consent or by the parent or guardian of the Child: first and/or last name, email address, parent's or guardian's name, and parent's or guardian's email address.\nHasbro may also collect the Child's mailing address and/or telephone number when necessary to respond to an inquiry or fulfill a transaction, such as sending the winner of a contest or sweepstakes the awarded prize.\nHasbro may also collect demographic information about a Child such as the Child's date of birth, gender, toy and game ownership and other preferences, and combine such information with the Child's personal information.\nPlease refer to the sections entitled <u>\"What information is collected from me?\"</u> and <u>\u201cHow does Hasbro use my information?\u201d</u> for further details on the information we collect and the tools we use to collect it.</p>\n<p>When registering an account to play online games, we may collect a username and password from registrants for the purpose of saving that user\u2019s gaming activities (e.g., pets collected in Littlest Pet Shop).\nOnce collected, we may also use the game play information for our internal marketing and demographic studies so that we can improve the products and services we provide our visitors in order to better meet their needs, or as otherwise described in this Policy.\nPlease note that we use aggregated (i.e., non-personal) information for analytics purposes.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we are prohibited by COPPA from conditioning a Child's participation in an activity - like contests - on the Child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.\nThis means that if we don't need a specific piece of information (like the Child's phone number) to allow the Child to participate in a contest, we simply won't ask for it, even with parental consent.\nTo read about the steps Hasbro takes to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of all users\u2019 personal information, please see our section on <u>\"Security\".\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Disclosure of Children's Personal Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We follow our standard policy <u>(\"With whom does Hasbro share my personal information?\")</u> for the disclosure of personal information collected from and about Children.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Parental Access</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A parent who has already given Hasbro permission to collect and use his or her Child's personal information can, at any time, do the following: (1) review, correct, or delete the Child's personal information.\nand/or (2) discontinue further collection or use of the Child's personal information.\nTo do so, please refer to the confirmation email provided to you when you gave consent or contact <u>Hasbro Consumer Care.</u> Please be sure to include your Child's name and email address, your name and email address, and the name of the site on which your Child is registered.\nAlternatively, you may contact us at:</p>\n<p>Hasbro, Inc.<br>\nAttention: Website Administrator<br>\n1027 Newport Avenue, Mailstop A906<br>\nPawtucket, RI 02861<br>\n(800) 255-5516</p>\n<p>For any other issue, please contact <u>Hasbro Consumer Care.</u>

Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We do not share your personal information with third parties other than as described in this Policy or in connection with the Services,

that we have collected from you through the Services, including on co-branded pages and where we have taken reasonable measures to de-identify such information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Social Sharing Features</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Services may offer third party social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook widget), which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa.\nThe use of such features may enable the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides these features.\nThe third party provider may also collect other information in connection with your use of their features, including your IP address, which page you are visiting on our
