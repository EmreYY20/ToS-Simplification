purchased products and services).\nIf you fail to provide the personal data we need, we may be unable to complete your transaction.</p>\n<p>We use personal data from employment applications where

within medical data products, personal data processed in communications products, biometric data processed in our biometric products, and any personal data contained within product usage data we collect, to deliver our Products sold to Nuance customers.\nOur processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing.\nOur automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods.\nFor example, our automated methods include artificial intelligence (AI), which we think of as a set of technologies that enable computers to perceive, learn, reason, and assist in decision\u2011making to solve problems in ways that are similar to what people do.\nTo build, train, and improve the accuracy of our automated methods of processing (including AI), we manually review some of the predictions and inferences produced by the automated methods against the underlying data from which the predictions and inferences were made.\nSnippets of your voice data, may be manually reviewed and transcribed into text for Nuance\u2019s product operation, tuning, maintenance, and enhancement.\nPrior to an employee or vendor reviewing voice data, where possible, we protect user's privacy by taking steps such as de\u2011identifing the data, requiring non\u2011disclosure agreements with\u202frelevant\u202fvendors and their employees, and requiring that employees and vendors meet high privacy standards.\n</p>\n<p>We may collect the following sensitive data from your use of our Products, subject to your jurisdiction,

transfer personal data across international borders and may process personal data to other Nuance affiliates, Nuance\u2019s parent corporation, or other companies performing support functions on our behalf (each as described above ) in countries and jurisdictions other than the location of original collection, including in countries and jurisdictions that are not subject to an adequacy decision by the European Commission or your national legislator or regulator, and that may not provide for the same level of data protection as your jurisdiction.\nIn such cases, we ensure that the recipient offers an adequate level of protection and security, for instance by entering into the appropriate agreements and, if required, standard contractual clauses or an alternative mechanism for the transfer of data as approved by the European Commission or other applicable regulators or legislators.\nWhere required by applicable law, we will only share, transfer or store your personal data outside of your jurisdiction with your prior consent.</p> General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") <p>Nuance has a range of privacy and security controls across its organizations to ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), including, but not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GDPR-compliant data protection agreements with all customers for whom Nuance Processes Personal Data.\n</li>\n<li>A PIA driven process to ensure that all products and services are built with Privacy By Design;</li>\n<li>An extensive, on-going training program for its employees, with data privacy and protection education upon hiring and then again at least on an annual basis;</li>\n<li>State-of-the-art technical and security measures, including data encryption at rest and in transit;</li>\n<li>Records of processing which include mapped storage and transfer of Personal Data throughout Nuance\u2019s product-lines;</li>\n<li>Appropriate access right limitations;</li>\n<li>Company-wide systems for protecting Data Subject rights, ensuring that individual access/portability/right-to-be-forgotten rights are respected.\nand</li>\n<li>Appointment of a Data Protection Officer.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>Lawful bases for processing personal information (applies only in the European Economic Area)</b>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>We process personal information where one or more of the following conditions that are set out in the GDPR apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where it is necessary in order for us to conduct our business and pursue our, or our affiliates' legitimate interests for internal administrative purposes.\nIn particular, we collect, use and store your personal information: (i) to communicate and manage our relationship with our customers.\n(ii) to allow our customers to use our Products.\n(iii) to develop new Products and to improve performance of our Products and software.\n(iv) to maintain contact data about you or a third party (such as, your employer).\n(v) to inform you of Products, marketing plan and other business related items which may be of interest to you.\n(vi) to ensure the security and proper performance of our systems and our operations, (vii) for accounting, billing and audit purposes and (viii) where appropriate, to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>\n<li>Where it is required by applicable privacy laws, we will obtain your consent to: (i)send you direct marketing in relation to relevant Products that we provide.\n(ii)place cookies and use similar technologies in accordance with the \u2018Cookies\u00b4section of this Statement and the information provided to you when those technologies are used;</li>\n<li>Where it is necessary in order for us to comply with our legal obligations, such as requirements to process requests by government or law enforcement authorities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>Transfers to third countries</b>\n<br>Whenever Nuance transfers personal information beyond the country of origin, we will do so in accordance with applicable laws.\nIn the context of its European operations, Nuance may transfer Personal Data abroad to other countries in the European Economic Area or to third countries.\nIn reaction to the decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union issued on July 16th 2020, in its Case C-311/18 Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland and Maximillian Schrems (called \u201cSchrems II case\u201d) and in furtherance to the Recommendations 01/2020 issued by the European Data Protection Board on measures that supplement transfer tools to ensure compliance with the EU level of protection of personal data, Nuance has evaluated the data transfers necessary for its multinational operations.\nNuance will ensure that importers of any Personal Data offer an adequate level of protection, whether through an adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards under Article 46 of the GDPR.</p>\n<p>To the extent Personal Data processed by Nuance would be transferred to a country, territory or sector outside the EEA that is not recognized by the European Commission as providing an \u2018essentially equivalent\u00b4 level of protection to that which exists within the EU, Nuance will rely on EU Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers: (i) between Nuance affiliates, and (ii) to third parties.\nThe EU Standard Contractual Clauses can be viewed on the European Commission\u2019s website here.\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en(Open a new window).\nAs per the guidance of the European Data Protection Board, Nuance has implemented programs to review such data transfers and to employ additional safeguards when appropriate for the data processing required by law and our customer contracts.\n</p>\n<p>With respect to personal data received or transferred, Nuance and its U.S.\nSubsidiaries are subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S.\nFederal Trade Commission.\nIn certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.\n</p> Security and Retention <p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received.\nInformation you provide to us is stored on our secure servers.\nAny payment transactions will be encrypted using current PCI-DSS standards.\nIf Nuance has issued you a password, you are responsible for keeping the password confidential.</p>\n<p>We store personal data to the extent necessary to provide Products to our customers, employees, and prospective employees.\nGenerally, we retain personal data for as long as you remain an active customer or user of our Sites and Services and for 3 years afterwards, or otherwise as required for our business operations or by applicable laws.\nWe will permanently destroy biometric data when the initial purpose for collecting or obtaining such data has been satisfied, or within 3 years of your last interaction with us, whichever occurs first.\nDifferent retention of personal data may be necessary under contractual terms with the data controller for whom we provide services, for fraud prevention, to identify technical problems, or to resolve legal proceedings.</p>\n<p>We may retain non-personally identifiable aggregate information beyond this time for research purposes and to help us improve and further develop our Products.\nYou cannot be identified from aggregate information retained or used for these purposes.\nWhere we process personal information for marketing or business analytic purposes or with your consent, we process the data until you ask us to stop and for a short period after this (to allow us to implement your requests).\nWe also keep a record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing or to process your data so that we can respect your request in the future.</p> Children <p>If a Nuance customer puts Nuance voice recognition Product technology in a customer product or service that is likely to be accessed by children, Nuance may receive speech data from product users to provide voice recognition to the user.\nThis is a function of how Nuance\u2019s voice technology works.\nThis means that if the user is under the age of 16, Nuance may receive personal data from children under the age of 16.\nIt is the responsibility of the Nuance customer to obtain any consents required under applicable law, including under the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act and relevant data protection laws, for the collection of such personal data.</p>\n<p>Except as described in the preceding paragraph, Nuance does not sell services to children and does not knowingly collect personal data directly from children under the age of 16.\nNuance has adopted a policy that Nuance will not provide hosted services to primarily child-directed websites and online services.\nNo child under 16 should directly submit personal data to Nuance.\nIf you become aware that a child under the age of 16 has submitted personal data to Nuance except as described in the preceding paragraph, please inform us by completing the Privacy Request\n(Open a new

any active processing) of your personal data held by us;</li>\n<li>to object to the processing of your data in some circumstances (in particular, where we do not have to process the data to meet a

violations in the mining of certain minerals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries.\nThe passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Section 1502 is a manifestation of this awareness.\nNuance is committed to the ethical sourcing of minerals used in our products.\nWe have been actively assessing whether our products contain tantalum, tin, tungsten or gold derived from ores mined in the DRC and adjoining countries (Conflict Minerals).\n</p>\n<p>It is Nuance's goal not to purchase product materials containing Conflict Minerals.\nThe global supply chain for these minerals is complex, and tracing such Conflict Minerals in our products to their source is challenging.\nNuance is working with our suppliers and other stakeholders to improve and systematically address the process for sourcing minerals that are \"conflict-free.\" </p>\n<p>Consistent with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, we expect our suppliers (and their suppliers and sub-suppliers) to comply with the applicable regulation to prevent Conflict Minerals from entering our products and processes.\nTo this end, Nuance is requiring all suppliers to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand where Conflict Minerals can enter their process</li>\n<li>Disclose the use of Conflict Minerals or certify that Conflict Minerals are not used in their materials or processes</li>\n<li>Work to eliminate use of Conflict Minerals discovered through these efforts</li>\n</ul> Notice specific to software available on this website <p>The materials on

Software piracy <p>Each copy of Dragon is licensed for use by a single user.\nWhen you purchase a genuine copy of Dragon, you become a licensed user and have purchased the right to use the software for a specific user.\nIt is against the law to give copies to friends and colleagues or to sell copies of the software to others.\nThe unauthorized copying of software is called piracy.\n</p>\n<p>Each copy of Dragon must be activated prior to use.\nThis helps us to discourage the piracy of our software and protects our customers from the risks of illegal and fake software.\nIn addition to potential viruses, pirated software does not offer the support, warranties and updates received with genuine copies of Dragon.\nUnfortunately, this process doesn't stop all software piracy.\nSome people continue to sell fake or illegal copies of Dragon, particularly through Internet storefronts or online auction sites.</p>\n<p>Since there are many legitimate online retailers of Dragon, it may be difficult to spot online piracy.\nBefore buying online, be sure to review the company's name, full address and phone number.\nInquire about the company's return policy, as well as service and warranty information.\nAsk directly if the software has been used or installed before.\nTo be sure that you are purchasing a genuine copy of Dragon, we encourage you to buy your products either directly from Nuance or from one of our authorized resellers.\n</p>\n<p>If you mistakenly purchased a pirated copy of Dragon, it is not supported by Nuance as we can\u2019t confirm the quality and full functionality of pirated products.\nAlthough Nuance regularly monitors the market for pirated versions of our software to protect our customer base, we can\u2019t be responsible for the activities of those who illegally copy the software.\nYou will need to return the software to its original source.\n</p> Copyright notice <p>Copyright \u00a9 2002-2023 Nuance Communications, Inc.\n</p>\n<p>All
