<p>DeepL reserves the right to restrict or suspend API features for other reasons than those specified in Section 3.2.4.\nIn such case, DeepL shall inform Customer of the proposed changes with two months\u2019 prior notice in writing (e-mail sufficient).\nFurthermore, DeepL shall grant Customer a reasonable period of at least two (2) months to declare whether or not Customer accepts the proposed changes.\nIf Customer does not give any notice within this period, which shall commence running from the receipt of the notification, the proposed changes shall be deemed as agreed.\nDeepL

invalid;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Customer has registered several times in order to use the service free of charge or Customer still has open payments from other contracts;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Customer uses a fraudulent, lost, stolen or blocked / inadmissible means of payment;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Customer has contested or demanded the return of a payment without informing DeepL of a valid reason for contesting or demanding the return.\nThe suspension of Customer\u2019s access will be upheld until Customer informs DeepL of a valid reason.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> 10.6 <p>In case Customer violates the restrictions on using the DeepL API key in certain types of products (Section 8.1.6), utilizes Products with unlimited usage in a way in which they were not intended to (e.g.\naccessing the DeepL Pro Translator in an automatic way) or allows more users to utilize Products than licensed, DeepL reserves the right to disable the access and cancel the Agreement with immediate effect.\nIn this case, Customer will be refunded fees already paid proportionally.</p>\n</li>\n<li> 10.7 <p>For products with a maximum monthly usage cap, DeepL will only allow the contracted number of characters (as described in the Service Specification) to be translated within a billing period.\nOnce the monthly usage limit is reached, Customer will no longer be able to use the Products, unless a Product with a higher number of characters has been purchased (if available).</p>\n</li>\n<li> 10.8 <p>Within the free trial period, Customer and DeepL are allowed to terminate the Agreement at any time with immediate effect.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> 11Right to withdraw from the contract <ol>\n<li>\n<p>If the Customer is consumer in terms of Section 13 German Civil Code (\u201c<i>BGB</i>\u201d) the

as long as necessary to create the translation and return it to Customer, as described in Section 3.1.2 of the Terms and Conditions.</p>\n<p>The DeepL Pro Translator does not impose limits on the length of the texts translated (contrary to the free translator available at https://www.deepl.com/translator).\nHowever, browsers, their Javascript execution environment, and the HTTP transmission techniques used impose technical limits.\nThe DeepL Pro Translator will try to notify the user about exceeding these limits and warn about possible performance issues.</p>\n<p>The DeepL Pro Translator allows Customer to translate whole documents.\nAbility to translate documents is subject to the ability of DeepL Pro to correctly read and translate the documents, which can't be
