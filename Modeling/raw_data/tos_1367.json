share of US$70).\nHowever, no payment would be made out to you, as your balance would be below the minimum threshold amount of US$100.\nThe balance of US$90 would carry over to the following month.</li>\n<li>\u2022If you earn US$110 during the month of June, your total balance would be US$130 (previous balance of US$20 + your June Net Ad Revenue share of US$110).\nWe would pay you US$100
