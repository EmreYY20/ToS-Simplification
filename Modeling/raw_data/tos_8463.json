SECTION 6.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Therapists and Therapist Services</p>\n<p>The Platform may be used to connect you with a Therapist who will provide services to you through the Platform (\"Therapist Services\").</p>\n<p>For U.S.\nbased Therapists</p>\n<p>We require every Therapist providing Therapist Services on the Platform to be an accredited, trained, and experienced licensed U.S.\npsychologist (PhD / PsyD), licensed marriage and family therapist (LMFT), licensed clinical social worker (LCSW), licensed professional counselor (LPC), or similar applicable recognized professional certification based on their state and/or jurisdiction.\nTherapists must have a relevant academic degree in their field, at least 3 years of experience, at least 1,000 hours of hands-on experience, and have to be qualified and certified by their respective professional board after successfully completing the necessary education, exams, training and practice requirements as

Therapists</p>\n<p>The Therapists are independent providers who are neither our employees nor agents nor representatives.\nThe Platform's role is limited to enabling the Therapist Services.\nThe Therapists themselves are responsible for the performance of the Therapist Services.\nIf you feel the Therapist Services provided by the Therapist do not fit your needs or expectations, you may change to a different Therapist who provides services through the Platform.\nWhile we have a large database of Therapists, you should note that because of licensure requirements that differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, not all Therapists available on our database will be available for you to match with, or at any particular time, or for any set period of time.\nIf a Therapist you have been connected with stops using the Platform at any time after you have been connected, we will send an email to notify you that your Therapist is no longer on the Platform and that you have the opportunity to match with a new Therapist.</p>\n<p>While we hope the Therapist Services are beneficial to you, you understand, agree and acknowledge that they may not be the appropriate solution for everyone's needs and that they may not be appropriate for every particular situation and/or a substitute for certain mental health needs that might require in-person therapy services, such as active withdrawal from certain substances or anorexia nervosa.</p>\n<p>IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT SUICIDE OR IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING HARMING YOURSELF OR OTHERS OR IF YOU FEEL THAT ANY OTHER PERSON MAY BE IN ANY DANGER OR IF

PLATFORM.</p>\n<p>YOU UNDERSTAND, AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MERCHANTABILITY,

limitation of liability as set forth above, the limitation will be deemed modified solely to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law.</p>\n<p>This section (limitation of liability) shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p> Arbitration</p>\n<p>THIS SECTION 6 OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE REFERRED TO AS THE \"ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.\"</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>By accepting the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and the Company (collectively, \"Parties\") agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy (except those specifically exempted below) arising out of or relating to (i) this Agreement and prior versions of this Agreement, or concerning the existence, applicability, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, scope, waiver, or validity thereof.\nand (ii) the use of the Platform or Therapist Services (collectively, \"Disputes\") will be resolved on an individual basis by final and binding arbitration, regardless of its date of accrual.\nExcept as it otherwise provides, this Arbitration Agreement is intended to apply to the resolution of Disputes that otherwise would be resolved in a court of law or before a forum other than arbitration.\nAll claims in arbitration are subject to the same statutes of limitation that would apply in court.\nBy accepting the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and the Company mutually agree to waive their respective rights to trial by jury.</p>\n<p>The Parties acknowledge that the Agreement involves interstate commerce and agree that all issues relating to arbitration or enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq.).\nThe arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (\"AAA Consumer Rules\"), which are available via the internet at www.adr.org or by using a service such as Google to search for \"AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules\".\nprovided however, that if there is a conflict between the AAA Consumer Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall govern.\nThe following terms and procedures shall apply:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The arbitration shall be heard by one arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA Consumer Rules.\nThe arbitrator shall be a member of the bar of the state in which the arbitration will be conducted or a retired judge from any jurisdiction and, in either case, shall have experience in the law underlying the dispute.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other than issues related to the Class Action Waiver (as defined below), the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, any part of it, or of the Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement or Agreement is void or voidable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the parties cannot otherwise agree on a location for the arbitration, the arbitration shall take place in Wilmington, Delaware.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Each party will pay the fees for its own attorneys, subject to any remedies to which that party may later be entitled under applicable law.\nIn all cases where required by law, the Company will pay the arbitrator's and arbitration fees.\nIf under applicable law the Company is not required to pay all of the arbitrator's and/or arbitration fees, such fee(s) will be apportioned between the Parties in accordance with said applicable law.\nAny disputes regarding whether the Company is required to pay the arbitrator's and arbitration fees and/or how those fees are to be apportioned between the Parties will be resolved by the arbitrator.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The arbitrator shall issue orders (including subpoenas to third parties for pre-hearing discovery) allowing the parties to conduct discovery sufficient to allow each party to prepare its claims and/or defenses, taking into consideration that arbitration is designed to be a speedy and efficient method for resolving disputes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Except as provided in the Class Action Waiver (as defined below), the arbitrator may award all remedies to which a party is entitled under applicable law and which would otherwise be available in a court of law, but shall not be empowered to award any remedies that would not have been available in a court of law for the claims presented in arbitration.\nThe arbitrator shall apply the state or federal substantive law, or both, as is applicable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Either party shall be permitted to file a motion to dismiss and/or motion for summary judgment and the arbitrator will apply the standards of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing such motions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The arbitrator's decision or award shall be in writing with findings of fact and conclusions of law.\nJudgment may be entered on the arbitrator's decision or award in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in connection with an arbitrable controversy in accordance with applicable law, and any such application shall not be deemed incompatible with or waiver of this Arbitration Agreement.\nThe court to which the application is made is authorized to consider the merits of the arbitrable controversy to the extent it deems necessary in making its ruling, but only to the extent permitted by applicable law.\nAll determinations of final relief, however, will be decided in arbitration.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If for any reason the AAA will not administer the arbitration, either party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction with authority over the location where the arbitration will be conducted for appointment of a neutral arbitrator.</p>\n<p>Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement prevents the investigation by a government agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise covered by this Arbitration Agreement.\nThis Arbitration Agreement also does not prevent federal administrative agencies from adjudicating claims and awarding remedies based on those claims, even if the claims would otherwise be covered by this Arbitration Agreement.\nNothing in this Arbitration Agreement prevents or excuses a party from satisfying any conditions precedent and/or exhausting administrative remedies under applicable law before bringing a claim in arbitration.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Class, Collective, and Other Representative Action Waivers (\"Class Action Waiver\").\nYou and the Company mutually agree that by entering into this Arbitration Agreement, both waive their right to have any dispute, claim, or controversy brought, heard or arbitrated as a class, collective, and/or other representative action to the maximum extent permitted by law, and an arbitrator will not have any authority to hear or arbitrate any such class, collective, or other representative action.\nYou also waive your right to receive notice of any class, collective, or other representative action that may be filed.\nNotwithstanding any other clause contained in this Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Consumer Rules, as defined above and incorporated herein by reference, any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.\nIn any case in which (i) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or other representative action.\nand (ii) there is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the class, collective, or other representative action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mass Arbitration.\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, to increase efficiency of resolution, in the event 25 or more arbitration demands of a similar nature are filed against the Company, presented by or with the assistance or involvement of the same law firm or organization, the Parties agree that this will constitute a \"Mass Arbitration\" and the following terms and procedures shall apply:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The Parties shall cooperate to group the arbitration demands into randomized batches of no more than 100 demands per batch.\nTo the extent there are fewer than 100 arbitration demands left over after the batching previously described, a final batch shall consist of the remaining demands.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Claimants' counsel shall organize and present the batched demands to the arbitration provider in a format as directed by the arbitration provider.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The arbitration provider shall treat each batch of demands as one case, with each case having one demand for arbitration, one appointed arbitrator, and one set of administrative documents, and administrative and filing fees per batch.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A separate arbitrator will be appointed to, and administrative and filing fees assessed for, each batch of demands.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Parties agree that arbitration demands are of a \"similar nature\" if they arise out of or relate to a similar factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief.\nYou agree to cooperate in good faith with the Company and the arbitration provider to implement such a batch approach to resolution and fees.\nDisagreements over the applicability of this batch arbitration process will be settled in a single, consolidated arbitration proceeding that includes all affected parties and is resolved by a single arbitrator subject to the requirements of this section.\nNotwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the contrary, batch arbitrations shall take place in Wilmington, Delaware.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Exceptions to Arbitration.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, this Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following claims: (i) individual claims brought in small claims court so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual basis.\n(ii) individual claims of sexual assault or sexual harassment occurring in connection with your use of the Platform.\nand/or (iii) injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.\nAlso, this Arbitration Agreement does not apply to disputes that may not be subject to arbitration as expressly provided by a controlling federal or state statute.\nDisputes between the parties that may not be subject to a pre-dispute arbitration agreement as provided by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Public Law 111-203), Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (H.R.\n4445), or as provided by an Act of Congress are excluded from the coverage of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Optional Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification.\nBefore initiating arbitration, you and the Company may first attempt to resolve any Disputes informally for 30 days, unless this time period is mutually extended by the Parties.\nThe informal negotiations begin upon receipt of written notice from one party to the other (\"Notice of Dispute\").\nThe Notice of Dispute must: (i) include the full name and contact information of the complaining party.\n(ii) describe the nature and basis of the dispute, claim, or controversy.\nand (iii) set forth the specific relief sought.\nThe Company will send its Notice of Dispute to your billing or email address.\nYou will send your Notice of Dispute to: BetterHelp, 990 Villa Street, Mountain View, CA 94041.\nAll offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the negotiation by any of the Parties, their agents, employees, and attorneys are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including as evidence of liability or for impeachment, in arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible as a result of its use in the negotiation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Application to Third Parties.\nThis Arbitration Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall include any claims brought by or against any third parties, including but not limited to your spouses, heirs, third-party beneficiaries and assigns, where their underlying claim(s) arise out of or relate to your use of the Platform or Therapist Services.\nTo the extent that any third-party beneficiary to this Agreement brings claims against the Parties, those claims shall also be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Right to Opt Out of Arbitration.\nYou may opt out from this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days after you first access or use the Platform by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to optout@faithfulcounseling.com, using the subject line \"Arbitration Opt-Out.\" Please state that you are opting out of this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver and provide your name and address.\nIf you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver within the 30-day period, neither you nor Faithful Counseling will be required to arbitrate disputes and may instead litigate those disputes without regard to this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver.\nFaithful Counseling members who accessed the Platform before April 6, 2023 will have the option to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver within 30 days of April 6, 2023.\nShould you not opt out of this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver within the 30-day period, you and Faithful Counseling shall be bound by the terms of this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver.\nYou have the right to consult with counsel of your choice concerning this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Survival.\nThis Arbitration Agreement survives after the termination or expiration of the Parties' relationship.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your Subscription</p>\n<p>We offer different subscription options that you can choose.\nincluding billing that can occur weekly, every (4) four weeks, or quarterly.\nAny type of subscription you choose will continue and <strong>automatically</strong> renew until you cancel the membership.\nBy choosing a recurring Membership Service, you acknowledge that such paid services have a recurring payment and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation.</p>\n<p>You can cancel the subscription to the service at any time for any reason.\nYour membership must be canceled before it renews in order to avoid the next billing cycle.\nFor the

does not rollover into June such that you will have 5 sessions available in June.\nAll sessions expire within the applicable billing cycle.</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to change our subscription or adjust prices of our services.\nAny changes to your membership services will only take effect following proper notice to you.</p>\n<p>Free Trials: Occasionally, we offer free trials for our Therapist

costs to you, we strive to deliver ads that are relevant, interesting, and personal.</p>\n<p>Therefore, if you opt in to Advertising cookies and web beacons, your IP address, Third Party identifier (if applicable), and some Visitor Data, excluding activity when you\u2019re logged in and have started therapy, may be shared for advertising purposes.\nAs a result, you may see ads for our services on some Third Party websites.</p>\n<p>Even if you do opt in, we still do not engage in \u201cretargeting\u201d advertising.\nRetargeting advertising is a type of advertising whereby advertisers leverage the fact that you viewed a page or took an action on their site to advertise to you again on third party properties in the hope that you will see the ad and return to their site.</p>\n<p>To be clear, we don\u2019t share any data or information you share with your Therapist with any Third Party advertisers.\nEven if you opt in to Advertising cookies and web beacons, we still don\u2019t share information with Third Party advertisers like Member names, email addresses, phone numbers, clinician diagnosis, questionnaires answers, sessions data, journal entries, messages, worksheets, or any other type of private communication you have with your Therapist on the Platform.</p>\n<p>For additional information regarding Third Parties that Faithful Counseling may share data with, please reference our Third Party Partners Disclosure List.</p>12.\nWhat is a cookie or web beacon?<i>\n</i>\n<i>\n</i>\n<p>A \u201ccookie\u201c is a small data file that is accessible within a folder on a computer, and it is used for record-keeping purposes.\nCookies are used to enhance performance of the Platform, personalize your experience and can be used for Third Party tracking (as described above).\nFor example, cookies may be used to help you quickly log into certain platforms and websites without having to enter your credentials every time.</p>\n<p>A \u201cweb beacon\u201c or \u201cpixel\u201d is a tiny and sometimes invisible image or embedded code, placed on a web page or email that can report your visit or use to a Third Party (as described above).\nIn general, these tools can be used to monitor the activity of users for the purpose of web analytics, advertising optimization, or page tagging.</p>13.\nWhat are you using cookies and web beacons for?<i>\n</i>\n<i>\n</i>\n<p>We use our own, Service Providers and Third Party cookies and web beacons to deliver a faster and safer experience, to monitor and analyze usage, to comply with laws, and for advertising purposes.\nTo read more about the kinds of Third Party cookies we use and their purposes go to \u2018List of Third Parties\u2018.\nTo update your settings or opt out, click

beacons, or for instructions on how to remove previously set cookies.</p>15.\nHow do you keep my data secure?<i>\n</i>\n<i>\n</i>\n<p>We apply industry standards and strive to apply best practices to prevent any unauthorized access and disclosure.\nInternet-based services carry inherent security risks, but our systems infrastructure, encryption technology, operation and processes are all designed, built, and maintained with your security and privacy in mind.\nOur Platform is certified by HITRUST - one of the most recognized data security certification programs in the health industry.</p>\n<p>Faithful Counseling has an experienced team of data security professionals whose job it is to make sure we use secure technology to protect your data.\nWe have an Information Security team who test internal security at Faithful Counseling to try and anticipate threat actors and act defensively to build processes and infrastructure to prevent incidents and attacks.\nWe have numerous robust security practices such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All messages between a Member and their Therapist are secure and have 256-bit encryption.</li>\n<li>Our servers are distributed across multiple Tier 3 AWS Data Centers for optimal security and protection.</li>\n<li>Our browsing encryption system (SSL) follows modern best practices.</li>\n<li>Our databases are encrypted and scrambled rendering them useless in the unlikely event that they are stolen or inappropriately retrieved.</li>\n<li>We have robust monitoring and alerting systems and procedures in place that include both automated systems and humans.\nFor example, there are always security personnel active in our 24/7 rotation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For your own security, keep the following in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Phishing: This is a type of online identity theft or account hacking.\nWe will never request your login information or credit card information in any non-secure or unsolicited communication.\nYou should always be diligent when you are asked to provide your account information and make sure it is in our secure system.</li>\n<li>External links: Our Platform may contain links to an external website or service.\nWe do not control external websites, and do not have control over their privacy policies and terms of use.\nThe fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization, or representation of our affiliation with that external party or of their privacy and security policies or practices.</li>\n</ul>16.\nDo you sell my data?<i>\n</i>\n<i>\n</i>\n<p>We aren\u2019t paid by anyone for any data.\nHowever, in California, the laws define \u201csale\u201d broadly to include the sharing of personal information in exchange for <em>anything of value</em>.\nIf you opt in to our use of Advertising cookies and web beacons, this use <em>may</em> be considered a \u201csale\u201d of personal information under that specific California law.\nFor specific information on your data rights as a resident of California, see the additional notice for California residents.</p>17.\nCan I sign up for Faithful Counseling and remain anonymous?<i>\n</i>\n<i>\n</i>\n<p>When you sign up for an account on Faithful Counseling, we do not ask you for your full name.\nYou may pick any name or \u201cnickname\u201d which will identify you in the system.\nYou will need to provide an email address so that we can verify your account, and so we can communicate with you.\nYou can choose an email that does not include your name(including if you are coming to us from an employer, organization, or other business partner and do not want to use your organization\u2019s email address), but you should be aware that in some jurisdictions emails may be considered \u201cpersonal data,\u201d \u201cpersonally identifiable information,\u201d or \u201csensitive personal data\u201d in certain circumstances.\nWhen you decide to start the therapy process, we\u2019ll ask you for your contact information for emergency situations such as if your Therapist thinks that you or someone else is in immediate danger.\nYour Therapist may request additional specific information about you as required by their license or other accreditation guidelines.</p>\n<p>Even though we try to limit the kinds of information you must provide to us as discussed above, it is very difficult to be truly \u201canonymous\u201d when you use any app or the internet.\nRead more about what data we Process and why here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What specific data are you Processing?</li>\n<li>Do you Process location

also needed to ensure our products and services function.</p>\n<p>In addition to the data retention schedule outlined below, BetterHelp maintains a process to receive and process, without undue delay, requests by Members to delete their data.\nThis process is outlined in the next section of this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>If you are a Member with a Faithful Counseling account:</strong> We

law?<i>\n</i>\n<i>\n</i>\n<p>When required by law, we cooperate with government agencies.\nThis is not unique to Faithful Counseling and is applicable to in-person therapy as well.\nFor example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena.\nKeep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them.\nMany jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that.\nWe encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations.</p>\n<p>You should also be aware that Therapists may be obliged to disclose information to authorities to meet professional and legal responsibilities.\nSpecifically, some laws require mental health professionals to disclose information and/or take action for: (a) reported or suspected abuse.\n(b) serious suicidal potential.\n(c) threatened harm.\nand (d) court-ordered treatment.\nYou should speak with your Therapist if you have concerns about this.</p>23.\nWill you change this Privacy Policy?<i>\n</i>\n<i>\n</i>\n<p>We may update this Privacy Policy.\nWhen we make significant changes to this Policy, we will notify you through our website
