Information</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nData Collection\n<p>There are two primary ways in which Splunk collects Information about you: through Interactions and through Offerings as set forth below.<br>\n<br>\n</p>\nInteractions\n<p>When you interact online or offline with Splunk, we may receive your Information, including your Personal Data.\nFor example, we receive your Information when you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visit Splunk\u2019s websites or offices</li>\n<li>Download materials through our websites</li>\n<li>Provide or update account information through our websites</li>\n<li>Register for or attend Splunk-hosted or sponsored events (such as promotional events, webcasts, contests, or hackathons)</li>\n<li>Participate in community programs and Splunk-managed repositories on third-party open-source platforms</li>\n<li>Communicate with us including by emails, phone, texts, and online chats</li>\n<li>Provide testimonials</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We collect Information about you from other sources such as public databases, commercial data sources, joint marketing partners, resellers, managed services providers and other partners, social media platforms, and conference/event hosts.</p>\n<p>We refer collectively to these contacts as \u201cInteractions\u201d and we explain below how we use the Information we collect through them.<br>\n<br>\n</p>\nWhat We Collect via Your Interactions\n<p>We (or others acting on our behalf) may collect your Information, including your Personal Data, through Interactions.\nThe Personal Data we collect includes such things as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name or alias</li>\n<li>Email address</li>\n<li>Physical address, including country</li>\n<li>Employer</li>\n<li>Title / position</li>\n<li>Payment details</li>\n<li>Phone number</li>\n<li>Username / user ID</li>\n<li>IP address</li>\n<li>MAC address (or other device identifiers automatically assigned to your device when you access the internet)</li>\n<li>Images and related metadata (for example, when visiting our offices or attending an event)</li>\n<li>Content of your communications and files you input, upload, or create</li>\n<li>Videos (for example, when you provide a product testimonial)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We collect Personal Data in various ways, such as when you manually key in your Personal Data to our website forms or provide it to us or others from whom we receive marketing leads.\nFrom time to time, we offer virtual private networks (VPNs) for attendees at Splunk events or visitors to our offices.\nIf you access a Splunk-provided VPN, we may collect Personal Data from you, such as IP and MAC addresses, when we monitor the VPNs for security or performance.</p>\n<p>IP addresses are also collected on an automated basis through your use of the website services using cookies, web beacons, and like technologies.\nWe may infer your location from your IP address.\nFor more on the use of cookies and like technologies, see the Splunk Cookie Policy and How We Use Information Collected from Interactions.</p>\n<p>When you make purchases through our website, we use third-party payment processors to collect credit card or other financial information.\nSplunk does not store the credit card information you provide, only confirmation that payment was made.<br>\n<br>\n</p>\nHow We Use Information Collected from Interactions\n<p>Splunk uses the Information we collect from your Interactions to deliver services to you in accordance with our terms, to fulfill our contractual and legal obligations, or to \u201cpursue legitimate business interests\u201d, as described below.\nWe take seriously the need to balance our legitimate interests with your privacy rights.\nWe summarize for you here how we use your Information, including Personal Data, to:<br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fulfill your orders or respond to your requests for information and other inquiries<br>\nFor example, to satisfy your requests for website materials such as marketing collateral or white papers, we collect and use your name and email address.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Operate, enhance, and personalize your experience on our website<br>\nWe collect Information via cookies and other information gathering technologies as stated in the Splunk Cookie Policy to fulfill our legitimate interest in operating our website, making it easy to navigate, enriching the available content and offering information tailored to your interests.\nIn doing so, we may receive your location information, which you can stop at any time by configuring the location setting permissions in your device.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Issue you Splunk accounts for access to online communities and forums and to enable your participation there<br>\nWhen you join our online communities and forums, including blogs and Splunk-branded business communication and streaming platform channels (collectively, \u201conline forums\u201d), we collect your Personal Data to enable your access and provide an interactive experience when you participate.\nThe guidelines associated with those online forums recommend not sharing private or proprietary information on them, as many of their aspects are public.\nIf you choose to submit content to online forums, such content will be considered \u201cpublic\u201d and will not be subject to the privacy protections set forth in this Privacy Policy except as required by applicable law.\nOnline forums that display the Splunk name but present you with their own privacy notice are subject to such privacy notice and not this Privacy Policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Send you administrative notices<br>\nWe may need to notify you (or we may choose to inform you) when we make updates to our terms or policies or make changes to our website services.\nWe will use your name and email address to send such administrative notices to you, which due to their nature are treated differently from marketing communications from which you can opt out.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Manage your Splunk account<br>\nTo perform the services under the contract between you and Splunk, we need to collect certain Information from you such as your contact and payment details.\nWithout this Information, we may not be able to deliver the services or comply with our contractual or legal obligations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Advertise and market to you<br>\nWith your consent or to pursue legitimate business interests, we may contact you with product announcements, educational materials, announcements about special offers, or information about upcoming or ongoing online/offline events, such as SplunkLive! or .conf, and related offers.\nIf required by applicable law, we will ask you for your consent before sending and/or give you the choice to opt out of receiving these communications.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Administer prize promotions and events<br>\nWe use your Information to administer prize promotions and events based on the terms of the promotion or event.\nFor example, if you enter into a prize promotion, we may use your data to select a winner and provide the prize to you if you win.\nOr, if you register for a coding workshop or a gaming or other event, we may add your name to the list of expected attendees.\nIf you win, we may seek your consent to announce you as a winner, with consent you may withdraw at any time.\nHowever, we will retain Information collected in connection with the enrollment contract.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Invite you to participate on customer advisory boards or in surveys, studies, and assessments of Offerings<br>\nWe use your Personal Data to register you to participate on advisory boards (such as our Customer Advisory Board or Product Advisory Council) or to request feedback from you about Splunk Offerings.\nWe use your feedback to fulfill our legitimate interest in improving our Offerings and growing our business.\nYour participation is voluntary and subject to the terms of your agreements with us and this Privacy Policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Diagnose and fix technical issues, monitor for security, and otherwise protect our property<br>\nWe do this to satisfy our legitimate interest in assessing actual or potential threats to our facilities, attendees at Splunk-sponsored events, our IT systems and networks, and website services.\nWe may process your Information, in particular your IP address, for this purpose.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To recruit you for a position at Splunk<br>\nWe may use your username or handle and contribution information from Splunk-managed repositories on third-party open-source platforms to fulfill our legitimate interest in identifying candidates for open positions at Splunk.\nFor example, we may use your contribution information in a Splunk-managed GitHub repository to consider you for and contact you about a position.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Comply with law<br>\nWe may use your Information to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, or to protect our legal rights or those of others.</p>\n</li>\n<li>For any other purpose disclosed to you in connection with our website services from time to time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we process your Personal Data for other purposes, we will provide you with information about such processing, and if required, obtain your consent.<br>\n<br>\n</p>\nOpting Out of Marketing Emails\n<p>If you no longer want to receive marketing emails from Splunk on a go-forward basis, please submit your request through our online data request portal.\nAlternatively, you may use the \"unsubscribe\" feature in our email messages.<br>\n<br>\n</p>\nOfferings\n<p>We also collect Information, including Personal Data, when providing our Offerings.\nWe may ask you for this Information directly, or in some cases, we may collect it when certain features are enabled.\nFor example, we collect Information from or about you when you (or someone you work with):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Order or sign up for a trial of our Offerings</li>\n<li>Interact with Splunk online or offline, including when you request support services</li>\n<li>Use our Offerings to process information</li>\n</ul>\nWhat We Collect via Our Offerings and How We Use It\n<p>We collect and process different types of product data (described below) when you deploy our Offerings in order to fulfill our contractual and legal obligations and operate our business or fulfill other legitimate interests.\nWe work hard to help ensure a balance between our legitimate interests and your privacy rights.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>License Usage Data</b> is Information that allows us to identify your on-premises account entitlements, such as license consumption, capacity, or type in our systems through an assigned license ID.\nWe use this information to validate accounts and automate license verification.<br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Usage Data</b> is Information about your operating environment and configuration, user/product interactions, and sessions.\nThis may include information about your network and systems architecture and configurations, OS and product versions, product configuration, applications installed, page loads and views, searches by number and type, errors, number of active and licensed users, source types and format (e.g., json, xml, and csv), web browser, http referrer page, and app workflows.<br>\n<br>\nWe use Usage Data to fulfill our contractual obligations in providing the Offerings to you and to fulfill our legitimate interest in supporting and enhancing them.\nFor example, we may use this data to:<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Troubleshoot issues, provide support, and update our Offerings</li>\n<li>Provide guidance to help you optimize your configuration, security, and usage of our Offerings</li>\n<li>Better understand how our users configure our Offerings</li>\n<li>Determine which configurations or practices optimize performance (e.g., best practices)</li>\n<li>Benchmark key performance indicators (\u201cKPIs\u201d)</li>\n<li>Recommend enhancements</li>\n<li>Perform data analysis and audits</li>\n<li>Identify, understand, and anticipate performance issues and the factors that affect them</li>\n<li>Identify product security issues that may affect you and inform you of them</li>\n<li>Improve and develop new features and functionality</li>\n<li>Monitor the health, performance, and security of our Offerings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We hash or otherwise pseudonymize identifiable information connected to user activity for data analytics purposes.</p>\n<p>In our paid on-premises products, you can set your level of participation.\nFor more details on what we collect and your participation options, see Splunk\u2019s Documentation.<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Support Usage Data</b> includes License Usage and/or Usage Data as part of a customized support program that offers you accelerated troubleshooting, notices of patches/upgrades, tips to optimize usage, security, configurations and/or performance, and suggestions about other Offerings that may be of interest to you.\nThe data is customer-identifiable so that we can help personalize your experience.\nFrom time to time, we may also use the Information to analyze usage trends, such as by data type, environment size, scale and architecture, and industry or sector, to develop and prioritize product enhancements (e.g., bug fixes or new features).\nOn-premises customers can opt out at any time.\nHowever, this Information is essential for the operation of our cloud Offerings.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Mobile Device Data</b> is Information we collect in certain Splunk Offerings (\u201cApps\u201d as discussed below) that associates your mobile device with an identifier for your App to help us improve the user experience and personalize your services and content.\nWe may also receive information that your mobile device sends when you use our Apps, such as a device identifier or OS.\nDepending on a customer\u2019s configuration of Splunk\u2019s Offerings, location information about a customer\u2019s end users may be shared with Splunk.\nYou can disable location sharing using the location-setting features on your mobile device.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Security Offerings Data.</b> Certain security-focused Offerings collect and in some cases allow sharing of Customer-submitted \u201cartifacts\u201d (such as logs, alerts, emails, cases, and incidents) and intelligence sources to support security investigation, threat detection and monitoring.\nIn some cases, this Information may contain names, IP addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and other types of Personal Data contained in such artifacts and intelligence sources.\nYou determine the extent and nature of the data you submit and whether to participate in such Offerings and in some cases to share the data with Splunk.\nParticipation in these services is voluntary and is further described in the relevant terms and Documentation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Certain Splunk Offerings rely on automated methods of processing, such as artificial intelligence, which is a set of technologies and processes that allow computers to learn, reason, and assist in decision making.\nThese technologies may consume Usage Data or other data you submit to the Offering that may be associated with you.\nThe use of data in connection with such Offerings is set forth in the relevant terms.</p>\n<p>For more information about the data collected through our Offerings, see the Offering-specific documentation (e.g., Share data in Splunk Enterprise in the Splunk Enterprise Admin Manual).<br>\n<br>\n</p>\nOther Collection Practices\n<p>We also collect Information from you to fulfill our contractual commitments to you.\nFor example, we collect contact information such as name, address (email and physical) and phone number to enter you into our databases and manage your account.\nWe also collect billing and payment information and information about Offerings, such as browser type, version number and OS, to administer your account, respond to customer service/support inquiries, and provide you with information about software updates via alerts or other \u201cpush\u201d notifications.\nWe may share this Information as described in How Splunk Shares Your Information.\nWe do not sell this Information.<br>\n<br>\n</p>\nData Collection Practices Associated with Apps\n<p>The Splunk Offerings are extendible using software applications commonly called \u201capps,\u201d \u201cadd-ons,\u201d \u201cwidgets,\u201d or \u201ctechnical add-ons\u201d that we offer through splunkbase.splunk.com or other websites that link to this Privacy Policy.\nWe refer to these collectively as \u201cApps.\u201d These Apps are versatile and have access to a broad set of web technologies that can be used to collect and use your Information.\nThis Privacy Policy only applies to Apps built by or on behalf of Splunk.\nIt does not apply to Apps developed by others (\u201cApp Developers\u201d) and available through splunkbase.splunk.com, third-party marketplaces or repositories (e.g., AWS Marketplace, Google Play Store, and GitHub), or interoperable with Splunk Offerings.</p>\n<p>Splunk requires App Developers to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws but cannot guarantee that they do so.&nbsp.\nBefore you use Apps created by App Developers, you should familiarize yourself with their privacy policies and license agreements.</p>\n<p>Splunk collects Information generated from the use and performance of Apps that interoperate with Splunk Offerings, such as crash information, version, session duration, and user engagement (e.g., number of downloads, active/licensed users, and logins).\nWe may share this data with App Developers so they can improve and enhance the performance of their Apps.<br>\n<br>\n</p>\nHow Splunk Shares Your Information\n<p>Splunk may disclose your Information to others in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Subsidiaries.\n</b>We may disclose Information to our subsidiaries subject to this Privacy Policy so that they can help market, sell, and service our Offerings.\nSplunk is the party responsible for the management of jointly used Personal Data.\nSplunk maintains intragroup agreements covering the use of Personal Data within the Splunk family of companies.<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b> Service Providers.</b> We may disclose Information to our service providers (e.g., infrastructure as a service, order fulfillment, professional/customer/support services), pursuant to written agreements with confidentiality, privacy, and
