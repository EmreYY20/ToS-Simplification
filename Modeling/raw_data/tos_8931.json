Terms of Service <p> Last updated on Jun 28, 2023 </p> Privacy Policy <p> This policy describes the ways we collect, store, use and protect your personal information.\nYou accepted this policy when you signed up for our Service.\nWe may amend this policy at any time by posting a revised version on our website.\nThe revised version will be effective at the time we post it.\nShould a revision prove unacceptable to you, please contact us at support@clean.email.\n</p> Our Commitment To Privacy <p> Your privacy is important to us.\nTo better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.\nIt represents our good-faith efforts to ensure your privacy and provide you with a great service.\n</p> The Information We Collect <p> This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Clean Email.\nThe types of personal information collected includes but is not limited to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Email address </li>\n<li>For third party mail providers (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, AOL) we may have to store authorization credentials and related information for other sites.\nWe will make it clear that we are requesting this information before you provide it and you can contact to have it removed.\n</li>\n<li>Data you give us permission to access (e.g., your Emails, Profile)</li>\n</ul>\n<p> We only access the envelope and header information associated with your emails.\nThe actual bodies of your emails are never downloaded or accessed within our computer systems.\n</p> The Way We Use Information <p> We use your email address to communicate with you and to authenticate with 3rd party products integrated with our system.\nWe will never sell or rent your email address or ANY personally identifiable or even aggregated information to another company.\n</p>\n<p> For diagnostic purposes, our engineers may have access to private data (e.g., to fix a problem with the service).\nBefore gaining such access, however, they must get management approval, and we are committed to maintaining the privacy of that data.\nRegardless, we will not read the bodies of your email messages (we may have to look at the envelopes (To/From/Subject/Date) as part of our diagnosis, but we ignore the bodies of messages).\n</p>\n<p> We may use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website.\n</p>\n<p> A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive.\nWe use cookies in order to track authentication and other session information.\nThese cookies are not shared with other sites and are not related to any marketing activities.\n</p>\n<p> All personally identifiable information gathered can be disclosed to judicial or other government agencies subject to warrants, subpoenas or other governmental orders.\nBut absent a legal compulsion, we will not divulge your information.\n</p>\n<p> Finally, we do not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above.\n</p> Additional Limits on Use of Your Google User Data <p> Notwithstanding anything else in this Privacy Policy, if you provide Clean Email access to your Google data, Clean Email\u2019s use of that data will be subject to these additional restrictions: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clean Email will only use access to read or control Gmail message metadata (including information about attachments), headers to provide a web service that allows users to process (delete/move/archive) emails and will not transfer this Gmail data to others unless doing so is necessary to provide and improve these features, comply with applicable law, or as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.\n</li>\n<li>Clean Email will not use this Gmail data for serving advertisements.\n</li>\n<li>Clean Email will not allow humans to read this data unless we have your affirmative agreement for specific messages, doing so is necessary for security purposes such as investigating abuse, to comply with applicable law, or for Clean Email\u2019s internal operations and even then only when the data have been aggregated and anonymized.\n</li>\n<li>Clean Email use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.</li>\n</ul> Our Commitment To Data Security <p> To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.\n</p>\n<p> All payments and payment information on our site is handled through FastSpring which is fully PCI DSS compliant.\nPCI DSS is the global standard for safeguarding financial transaction data.\nPayments for iOS mobile apps are charged to your \"iTunes Account\" at confirmation of purchase.\nNo customer financial information is ever stored within our computer systems.\n</p> Our Commitment To Children's Privacy <p> Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important.\nFor that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.\n</p> Who Owns Your Data? <p> You own the data associated with your account.\nAnd, at any time, you can securely remove your data from our servers by using a feature in the application or contacting our support and requesting such a deletion.\nThis will be true even during a corporate merger or a corporate bankruptcy.\n</p>Data Retention<p>When you cancel your membership, your account will remain active for the time your subscription was paid for unless otherwise requested.\nAll cancelled subscriptions are automatically deactivated at the end of the paid period and they will revert to free accounts status.\n</p>\n<p>All the data indexed for your email is automatically deleted from our servers 45 days after your last login to the service as long as there is no active subscription running.\n</p>\n<p>If for any reason, we decide to close Clean Email, all users will be contacted by email and their account information will be securely deleted from our servers in a timely manner.</p>Terms of ServiceAcceptance of the Terms of Use<p>\n</p>\n<p>Welcome to

Plan at a significant discount.\n<b>We recommend this plan for customers who are certain that Clean Email is compatible with their needs</b>.\nIt is your responsibility to evaluate Clean Email, including its features, limitations, and system requirements before selecting the Annual Plan.\n</p>\n<p>If you are not certain that Clean Email is a fit for your use case, then you should not choose the Annual Plan.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Clean Email does not provide refunds to Annual Plans customers</b> on the basis of customers not understanding of the system requirements, or the presence of compatibility issues, including inadequate internet speed or consistency, or incompatible devices, operating systems, or browser software versions.\n</p>\n<p>If you choose the Annual Plan, you are entering into a one-year subscription contract that expires 12 months after you sign up.\nYou are responsible for paying for the entire subscription term.\nIf you decide to cancel your subscription before the subscription term, then you will still be billed for the remaining months of your subscription, and you will still have access to the benefits of the service until the end of the
