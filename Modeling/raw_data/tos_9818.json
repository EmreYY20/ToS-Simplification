will provide parental notice and/or seek parental consent.\nWhen the Services collect personal information from a child, we will retain that information only so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was provided or ensure the security of our users and our services, or as required by law.\nIf we learn that the Services have collected information from a child in a way not permitted by applicable law, we will either delete the information or immediately seek the parent\u2019s consent for that collection.Verifiable Parental Consent.\nParent Email AddressIn the event Bentkey wishes to collect personal information from a child in a way that requires parental consent under applicable laws, we will first seek a parent or guardian\u2019s verifiable consent.\nIn some cases, we will seek to obtain consent by email as described herein or during the account registration process.\nIn the email and in the registration process we will explain what information we are collecting, how we plan to use it, how the parent can provide consent, and how the parent can withdraw consent.\nIf we do not receive parental consent within a reasonable time, we will delete the parent contact information and any other information collected from the child in connection with that activity.\nIn some cases, we may seek verifiable consent through other means, including asking for a credit card or other payment method for verification.As required by COPPA, on any child-directed site or application, or in any instance where we ask for age and determine the user is under the age of 13, we will ask for a parent or guardian email address for notice or consent purposes before we collect any personal information from the child unless consent has been provided during the registration process.\nIf you believe your child has provided personal information to us and you or another parent/guardian have not provided consent during registration or received an email providing notice or seeking your consent, please contact us at privacy@bentkey.com.User SignupTo become a Bentkey subscriber you must be 18 years of age, or the age of majority in your state or territory of
