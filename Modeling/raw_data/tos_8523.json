\u201cterrorist supporting\u201d country.\nor (2) are listed on any U.S.\nGovernment list of prohibited or restricted parties.\nYou also promise not to export the Services to countries requiring a

(<strong>\u201cExport Laws\u201d</strong>).\nWithout limitation, you agree to strictly comply with all such Export Laws and acknowledge that you have the responsibility to obtain authorization to export, re-export, or import the Application and related technology, as may be required.\nYou represent and warrant that: (1) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S.\nGovernment

Subscription at any time for any reason set forth below.</i>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p> Subject to additional terms governing your purchase of, subscription to, and/or use of specific Services, the following termination terms shall apply: </p>\n<p> \u2003\u2003<strong>(1) Trial Access.</strong> On a case-by-case basis, Services may be made available to you for a trial review period, typically for up to fifteen (15) days (<strong>\"Review Period\"</strong>).\nDuring the Review Period, you will be provided access to the Services without charge.\nIf your Review Period is time limited, however, access to the Services offered for trial review will be terminated if payment is not made prior to the end of the Review Period.\nTermination of a Service does not automatically terminate your User Account.\nFurther, you expressly acknowledge and agree that if at any time during the Review Period, Pearson, in its sole discretion, determines that you are utilizing the Review Period as a substitute or proxy for a paid Service, it may immediately terminate or suspend your access to the applicable Service for which you\u2019ve been granted a Review Period.\nIn the event of any suspension or termination of your access to such a Service, you acknowledge and agree that: (1) the Service, its functionality, activities, materials, or any results generated by your use thereof may not be available to you or any other person.\nand (2) neither you nor any other person are authorized to access or use any results generated by your use of the suspended or terminated Course, its functionality, activities, or materials regardless of whether such results are available within the Course or the Services.\nIf your access to a Course is terminated due to you not purchasing a Course Subscription, and then Pearson subsequently reinstates your access to the Course upon later receiving payment, any such reinstated access shall remain subject to the terms of these UTOS.\n</p>\n<p> \u2003\u2003<strong>(2) Termination by You.</strong> Subject to account restrictions that may be imposed by your Institution or a Third-Party Service through which access to the Services is provided, you may terminate your User Account at any time by notifying Pearson of your decision to do so.\nYour satisfaction with the Services is important to us.\nIf you have any concerns or complaints about the Services or wish to terminate your access to the Services, please contact us at Pearson Support.\n</p>\n<p> \u2003\u2003<strong>(3) Termination by Pearson.</strong> Pearson may, in its sole discretion, with or without advance notice, and/or at the request of your Institution, suspend or terminate your access to, or your rights to use, all or any part of the Services for any conduct or use (whether by you or anyone else having access to the Services under your User Account) that Pearson reasonably believes violates the UTOS or AUP.\n</p>\n<p> \u2003\u2003<strong>(4) Effect of Termination.</strong> Whether termination is initiated by you, your Institution or Pearson, the terms of the UTOS and AUP, and Sections 10, 20, and 21 of these UTOS shall survive any such termination.\nAny User Account information, data, settings or specifications, or customizations of a Service or Subscription specific to your User Account may be permanently lost upon termination of a Service or Subscription, whether by you, Pearson, or your Institution.\nUser Content and other user information associated with your use of the Services may still be accessible by your Institution or, to the extent it is posted in a public forum, to other users of the Services for which such information was posted, even after termination.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li> Your exclusive remedies under these UTOS <p>\n<strong>\n<i>If something goes wrong, your only remedies under these UTOS are: (1) restoration of access to the Services.\nor (2) a pro-rata refund of fees.</i>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Pearson's entire liability to you, and your sole and exclusive remedy, regarding the use of the Services shall be either, in Pearson\u2019s sole discretion: (1) restoration of access to the Services to which you have subscribed.\nor (2) a pro rata refund of any fees paid directly by you to Pearson for the particular Service or Subscription.</p>\n<p> Unless product-specific subscription terms provide otherwise, refunds, when available, will only be made if requested by you in writing within the first 15 days after Enrollment or registration.\nRefunds can only be provided for purchases made directly from Pearson's website by an Authorized User.\nRefunds are not available for lost or stolen access codes, or any purchases made through third parties (for example, your campus bookstore).\nIf you are dissatisfied with a Service or wish to request a refund, please contact us at Pearson Support.\n</p>\n<p>If you reside in Australia, the Services come with warranties and guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law (Consumer Guarantees).\nThe remedy you are entitled to if the Services fail to meet the Consumer Guarantees will depend on whether the failure to comply with the Consumer Guarantees is major or minor.</p>\n</li>\n<li> A few additional, miscellaneous terms <p> To the extent additional terms governing your purchase of, subscription to, and/or use of specific Services conflict with these UTOS, such product-specific terms shall control.\nThese UTOS are personal to you, and you may not assign, transfer or delegate your User Account or your rights or obligations under these UTOS or the AUP (collectively, the <strong>\u201cTerms\u201d</strong>) to anyone.\nPearson may assign or delegate its rights or obligations under the Terms, in whole or in part, subject to Pearson's right and obligations under the Terms and any agreement it may have with your Institution.\nIn the event that any provision of the Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remainder of the Terms shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms.\nThe Terms comprise the entire agreement between Pearson and you with respect to the Services and cannot be modified by you absent a signed written agreement.\nSection headings and summaries in the Terms are for your convenience only and do not have any legal meaning or effect.\nIf Pearson waives or fails to enforce any term or condition of the Terms on any one or more occasions, whether by conduct or otherwise, its waiver or failure to enforce such terms will not prevent Pearson from enforcing any terms or condition of the Terms at any other time.\nIt is the express wish of the parties that the Terms and all related documents be drawn up in English.\nC\u2019est la volont\u00e9 expresse des parties que la pr\u00e9sente convention ainsi que les documents qui s\u2019y rattachent soint r\u00e9dig\u00e9s en
