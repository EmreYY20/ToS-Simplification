below:</p> Type of cookie Purpose <em>Essential Cookies </em>\n<p>These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our Site and to enable you to use some of its features.\nFor example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of our Site and help the content of the pages you request load quickly.\nWithout these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.</p>\n<em>Functionality Cookies</em>\n<p>These cookies allow our Site to remember choices you make when you use our Site, such as remembering your language preferences, remembering your login details and remembering the changes you make to other parts of our Site which you can customize.\nThe purpose of these

cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Site and how users use our Site.\nThe information gathered does not identify any individual visitor.\nThe information is aggregated and anonymous.\nIt includes the number of visitors to our Site, the websites that referred them to our Site, the pages they visited on our Site, what time of day they visited our Site, whether they have visited our Site before, and other similar information.\nWe use this information to help operate our Site more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity
