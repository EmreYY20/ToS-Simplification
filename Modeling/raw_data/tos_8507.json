Wyoming still has a long way to go before its data privacy legislation equals that of California and some other data-privacy focused states, but the 2015 passing of Senate Bills SF35 and SF36&nbsp;shows that Wyoming is up to the task.\nThese bills broadened Wyoming\u2019s definition of \u201cpersonal identifying information\u201d (including even unique biometric data paired with a consumer\u2019s first name or first initial and last name) and expanded the state\u2019s requirements for individuals and businesses providing breach notifications to affected Wyoming residents.</p>\n<p>But even if Wyoming itself still has a ways to go when it comes to data privacy, the same thing can\u2019t be said for us.\nAt Wyoming Registered Agent Services LLC, we\u2019re a privacy-focused company that strives to keep your data secure and never&nbsp;sells our user or client data to third-parties.&nbsp;We hang our hat on caring for our customers and their information as we would our own.\nFor us, there is no other way to do business.</p>\nDisability Accommodation\n<p>Do you have a disability that makes it difficult for you to read or use this Privacy Policy in its current form? If so, please do not hesitate to reach out to the Wyoming Registered Agent Services LLC Privacy Team for assistance by email or by phone:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Email:</strong>

website, through the use of cookies and other tracking technologies as described below.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Related Entities</strong>\n<br>\nWe may collect information about you from another

server.\nCookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.\nIf you register an account with us, a cookie allows us to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.\nThis facilitates the process of recalling your personal information so that when you return to our website, the information you previously provided can be easily retrieved.\nMost web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can typically modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you want to.\nIf you choose not to allow cookies, this may impact your ability to log into your account or experience the full interactive features of our Services.</p>\n<p>We also employ a technology called web beacons or \u201cclear gifs\u201d that help us track referrals from our partners and affiliates and better manage content on our website.\nClear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track

information to you.\nIn certain telephone and in person transactions, we may ask for certain client identifiers or other information to verify your identity before conducting the transactions you have requested.</p>\n<p>Please understand that while we try our best to safeguard your personal information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.\nWe periodically review our security procedures to consider appropriate technology and methods to secure information.</p>\nFor California Residents\n<p>We do not, and

their information.\nand iv) the categories of third parties with which their information is shared.</p>\n<p>California residents also have the right to submit a request for deletion of their information under certain circumstances.\nThis is not an absolute right, and we may decline to delete information when retention is allowed by law, for example, when we have an on-going business relationship with the person, we have a continued need to use the information, or we need to retain the information in order to comply with a legal obligation.</p>\n<p>If you exercise your rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, we will not provide discriminatory treatment to you.</p>\n<p>If you would like to submit a request about your data, or obtain additional information,

with California law, we will not be able to satisfy your request until we have verified your identity.</p>\n<p>You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf.\nIn order to

legal advice.\nWe provide information and act as a fulfillment service provider.\nAs we are not attorneys, there is no attorney-client relationship between us and none of the communications between us

AMOUNT YOU PAID TO US FOR SERVICES DURING THE TWELVE MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE DATE OF YOUR CLAIM.</p>\nBusiness Filing and Registered Agent Services\nAccurate and Current Information\n<p>Because of various state requirements and statutes, we do need accurate information concerning the filings we perform on your behalf.\nWe don\u2019t sell your information and we keep all information that is not required on public documents private.</p>\n<p>However, you agree that you are solely responsible for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, and appropriateness of your information.\nYou also agree that the accuracy of filings which we make on your behalf depends on the information you provide and you agree to promptly notify us when any of your information changes.</p>\nService Providers\n<p>There\u2019s a lot of logistics involved with registered agent services and sometimes we utilize professionals like couriers, attorneys and other third-parties to fulfill our registered agent duties.\nThis item is to make sure you understand and agree that these service providers may assist us in providing you with registered agent services.</p>\nAccepting Service of Process and Other Legal Documents\n<p>As your Wyoming registered agent, we need to accept a variety of legal documents on your behalf and upload them into the online account we provide you.\nYou authorize us to receive <em>\n<strong>up to 15</strong>\n</em> service of process, important communications, and legal documents of any kind (\u201cLegal Documents\u201d) on your behalf per year.&nbsp;We reserve the right, and you agree, that a fee may be applied to your account for Legal Documents received above the current <em>\n<strong>15 per year</strong>\n</em> limit.\nYou also acknowledge and agree that this fee may be subject to change as a result of our sole discretion and determination.\nYou also agree that we can open, scan, upload and transmit the Legal Documents into your account in connection with providing Services to you.</p>\n<p>Registered agent services are limited to the receipt of service of process as well as the receipt and forwarding of Legal Documents, and do not include the receipt of any general or regular mail or other items.\nAccordingly, we do not assume liability to you, or any third party, for loss of mail or other items which are not Legal Documents.</p>\nRegular Documents\n<p>Not all documents are created equally.\nThe documents that we receive at our addresses on your company\u2019s behalf which are not communications from the Secretary of State related to your company\u2019s registration nor documents related to legal service of process are considered by us to be \u201cRegular Documents.\u201d Depending on which services you have purchased from us, there may be a limit on how many Regular Documents will be accepted by our office on your company\u2019s behalf without incurring additional fees.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you may be charged for any physical document forwarding requests that exceed your purchased limits.\nYou agree to pay the fees that we post to your account related to any Regular Documents which we receive on your company\u2019s behalf in excess of your purchased service limit.\nThis includes any fees posted in relation to requests to forward physical documents.</p>\n<p>While we strive to process your Regular Documents as quickly as possible, you agree that we are not liable for any missed deadlines, time limits or other time sensitive Regular Documents we may receive, regardless if such Regular Documents are within your purchased service limit or not.</p>\nDestruction of Documents\n<p>We do not perpetually retain the original copies of documents received by our offices.\nWe expect that clients and their beneficiaries will diligently and promptly act to avoid any delivery of vital documents to our offices.\nIn the event such documents or other mailings are delivered to our offices, we expect that clients and their beneficiaries will diligently act to request the original document or mailing to be forwarded to the client.\nUnless otherwise agreed in writing, all such forwarding requests will be at the client\u2019s expense.\nAll documents and mailings are destroyed after sixty (60) days following the digital scanning of the documents and mailings.</p>\nElectronic Signatures and Records\n<p>We\u2019re a digital company and sometimes we need your electronic or hard copy signature, so we can file documents on your behalf.\nYou agree to provide that signature to us when required.</p>\nReceipt of Packages\n<p>While we are thrilled to serve as your registered agent and receive service of process and legal documents on your behalf, we should not be receiving packages on your behalf.\nPackages arriving at our office will be refused upon delivery or returned to their location of origin if immediate refusal is not possible.\nIn the event that neither refusal nor return of the package is an option, you will be informed that we have it in our possession.\nBy using our services you agree that, if we receive packages on your behalf, we are not acting as a bailee or warehouse and owe no duty of care in the holding and/or shipping of packages.\nIf you would like the package delivered to the address associated with your account, you will be responsible for all shipping associated with the shipment of the package.\nYou will also be responsible for the insuring of the package.\nWe will only hold packages for 14 days from the date of receipt and notification before properly disposing of them.</p>\nTermination of Services (Registered Agent and/or Other Services)\n<p>When any Service with us is canceled or terminated, you acknowledge and agree

also terminate a Service or Services at any time.\nTo terminate a Service other than Registered Agent Services, log in to your account and cancel your Service in your client portal.</p>\nHow to Terminate or Cancel a Service\n<p>To end a service with us and no longer receive invoices, you are required to login and request cancellation of a service with us directly, so you can read and agree to the end of service terms.</p>\n<p>Cancellation can be requested at any time.\nThere are no fees to cancel, but upon cancellation of services, you may be required to pay any past-due balances related to such services, unless otherwise specified in this agreement.</p>\nElecting to Use Auto-Pay\n<p>Some of our Services are billed via an automatic payment feature unless you choose to opt out of this feature within your client account.\nCustomers who opt-out will be invoiced for payment.\nAll accounts using auto-payment must provide us with valid and current credit card information and you agree that we are authorized to charge such credit card for all purchased Services as well as fees incurred in providing you with Services.</p>\nSpecifics Regarding Auto-Pay:\n<ul>\n<li>all auto-payments will be charged to the credit or debit card on file for the business entity or individual.</li>\n<li>all auto-payment services must be canceled at least one (1) day before the next charge date to avoid paying for the next month of Services, or year of annual Service.\nAll cancellations must be handled through your online account.</li>\n<li>customers enrolling in our Virtual Office Services must enroll in monthly automatic payments and you authorize us to charge your account for Services every thirty days.</li>\n<li>annual auto-pay charges that fail to process will be rendered an unpaid invoice in your online account and subject to the fees and procedures outlined in these Terms.</li>\n<li>monthly subscription or auto-pay charges that fail to process will result in the cancellation of all applicable Services and features.</li>\n</ul>\nDeclined Payments/Collections:\n<p>Like any other functioning business, we try to collect the money owed to us.\nThat being said, we will always do our best to treat each client with the respect they deserve.\nTo that end, this section addresses how we handle declined payments and collections, and also outlines what you\u2019re agreeing to as our client.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re enrolled in an autopay service, we\u2019ll charge whatever payment methods are stored in your online account.\nIf all methods fail or there is not a valid method saved, we may suspend your account and require payment in order to reinstate services or in order to cancel your services.\nWhile we personally find the idea of collections revolting, we reserve our right to use legal action and collection agencies if deemed necessary.</p>\n<p>To keep our lawyers satisfied, this is the more technical and detailed version:</p>\n<p>If we don\u2019t receive payment (\u201cNon-Payment\u201d), you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand to resume or cancel your Service(s).\nYou also authorize the Company to charge any and all outstanding fees and penalties that become due as a result from such Non-Payment.\nAdditionally, following any such Non-Payment, you will not be eligible for monthly-billing or partial payments until your account is brought current.\nNon-Payment may also result in delayed services which include but are not limited to: locked documents, non-filing of compliance documents and the processing of additional orders.</p>\n<p>You agree that you are liable for all third-party collection agency recovery fees and charges.\nYou are solely responsible for any and all fees charged to your credit card by the issuer, bank, or financial institution including, but not limited to, membership, overdraft, insufficient funds, and over the credit limit fees.\nBy failing to notify the Company of billing problems or discrepancies you agree that you waive your right to dispute such billing discrepancies.\nWe may modify the price, content, or nature of the Service(s) at any time.\nWe may provide notice of any such changes by email, notice to you upon log-in, or by publishing them on our website.</p>\nRefunds\n<p>Unless otherwise stated herein, all purchases are final and non-refundable after 90 days.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges or credits more than 90 days old, unless otherwise agreed to in writing between you and us and/or is specific to the type of service we are providing or is required by law.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion unless otherwise required by law.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.</p>\nSMS/Text Messaging\n<p>By providing your mobile phone number and checking that you wish to receive communications, you are consenting to receive&nbsp;Short Message Service (SMS)/text messages from us.\nThe SMS/Text messages you may receive service-related&nbsp;and

website.</p>\n<p>By continuing to use or access the Service after the revisions come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>\nWaiver, Severability, and Assignment\n<p>Our failure

remain in full force and effect.</p>\n<p>You may assign your rights and obligations under these Terms provided we receive prior written notice of, and approve of, such assignment.\nWe will not
