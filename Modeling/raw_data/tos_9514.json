consideration by the Guided Open Access programme.</p>\n<p>Please note that we may change these Terms from time to time without notice so you should review them each time that you plan to submit a manuscript for consideration through Guided Open Access.</p>\n<p>In addition to these Terms, Nature Portfolio websites and platforms (\u201cSites\u201d) that you visit in connection with Guided Open

programme that enables you to submit your Article to one Nature Research journal, and be considered simultaneously by two other associated journals in the Nature Portfolio.\nSee our Guided OA page for further details on the Guided OA programme.</p>\na.Initial Submission\n<p>In order to participate in the Guided OA programme, you must select the Guided OA option when submitting your Article to a participating Nature Research Journal, and provide all information required pursuant to the submission process.\nIf your Article is deemed appropriate for the Guided OA programme, it will be assigned to a handling editor from one of the participating journals, and you will be asked to arrange payment of an Editorial Assessment Charge (see Charges, below).\nIf your Article is determined not to be suitable for any of the journals in the Guided OA programme, you will be notified and no Editorial Assessment Charge will be payable.</p>\nb.Editorial Assessment Report\n<p>Once your article has been assigned to a handling&nbsp.\neditor and you have provided billing details for the Editorial Assessment Charge, your Article will be sent for peer review in accordance with our standard practices.\nOn the basis of their expert judgement, and the feedback from one round of peer review, the Nature Portfolio editor responsible for your Article will prepare an Editorial Assessment Report (EAR).\nThe EAR will typically provide an editorial evaluation of the manuscript, an open research evaluation, guidance for adhering to best reproducibility practice, and help to navigate and interpret the reviewers\u2019 feedback, but contents of individual EARs may vary.\nIf your Article is provisionally recommended for publication after the first round of peer review, the EAR will recommend which journal(s) will be suitable for publication of your Article.\nIf you choose to continue with a recommended journal, the peer review process will continue in accordance with the journal\u2019s standard practice.\nHowever, you are under no obligation to continue with a recommended journal, and may use the EAR in connection with preparation for submission of your Article to another journal.\n<strong>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR PARTICIPATION IN GUIDED OA (1) DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOUR ARTICLE WILL BE PEER REVIEWED AT THE JOURNAL OF YOUR CHOICE, AND (2) DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE PUBLICATION OF YOUR ARTICLE IN ANY PARTICULAR PARTICIPATING JOURNAL, OR IN ANY OF THE PARTICIPATING JOURNALS.&nbsp.\nSUBMITTED MANUSCRIPTS WILL BE REVIEWED AND PUBLISHING DECISIONS MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HIGH STANDARDS OF NATURE PORTFOLIO JOURNALS.\nTHE LIKELIHOOD OF ACCEPTANCE OF A MANUSCRIPT FOR PUBLICATION IN PARTICIPATING JOURNALS UNDER THE GUIDED OA PROGRAMME WILL BE NO GREATER THAN FOR MANUSCRIPTS SUBMITTED TO SUCH JOURNALS UNDER STANDARD SUBSCRIPTION OR OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING TERMS.</strong>\n</p>\n&nbsp.\nc.\nPublication\n<p>Articles published through the Guided OA Programme will be published under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license.</p>\n2.\n<strong>Eligibility</strong>\n<p>If you are affiliated with an institution participating in a Fully OA agreement or Transformative (or Compact) agreement that includes Nature Portfolio journals, you will not be eligible for Guided Open Access, where fees are applied before acceptance (Editorial Assessment Charge).\nDirect Open Access is available to you by selecting the open access option once your paper has been accepted, with your fees covered by the relevant institutional agreement.\nPlease check our &nbsp;OA agreement pages for further information about what fees are covered.</p>\n3.\n<strong>Charges</strong>\n<p>Once your Article has entered the Guided Open Access process, you will be required to complete a Guided OA Editorial Assessment Charge (EAC) Payment Form, and arrange payment of the EAC.\n<strong>THE EDITORIAL ASSESSMENT CHARGE WILL NOT BE REFUNDED EVEN IF YOUR ARTICLE IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PUBLICATION IN ONE OF THE GUIDED OA JOURNALS PURSUANT TO THE EDITORIAL ASSESSMENT OR IS OTHERWISE NOT PUBLISHED IN A GUIDED OA JOURNAL FOR ANY REASON.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If your article is accepted for publication after completion of the peer review process at a recommended journal, you will be required to complete a Guided OA Top-Up Article Processing Charge (APC) Payment Form, and arrange payment of the Top-Up APC.</p>\n<p>If your Article is published in a Nature Research journal (Nature Physics,&nbsp;Nature Methods&nbsp;or&nbsp;Nature Genetics), the combined amount of the EAC and the Top-Up APC will be lower than the cost of publishing on an open access basis directly through those journals, outside of Guided OA.\n<strong>IF YOUR ARTICLE IS PUBLISHED IN NATURE COMMUNICATIONS OR ONE OF THE COMMUNICATIONS JOURNALS, THE COMBINED AMOUNT OF THE EAC AND THE TOP-UP APC WILL BE SOMEWHAT HIGHER THAN THE COST OF PUBLISHING ON AN OPEN ACCESS BASIS DIRECTLY WITH ANY OF SUCH JOURNALS, OUTSIDE OF GUIDED OA.</strong> Please see the Nature Research Guided Open Access page for exact costs.&nbsp;</p>\n4.\n<strong>Right of
