Services, these Terms and this Arbitration Agreement, shall be determined by binding arbitration or in small claims court.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award and nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall be interpreted as limiting any non-waivable statutory rights.\nYou agree that, by agreeing to these Terms, the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Weee! are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.\nThis arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your Weee! membership.</p>\n<p>If you elect to seek arbitration or file a small claims court action, you must first send to Weee!, by certified mail, a written Notice of your claim (\"Notice\").\nThe Notice to Weee! must be addressed to: Legal Department, Weee! Inc., 47560 Seabridge Drive, Fremont, CA 94538 (\"Notice Address\").\nIf Weee! initiates arbitration, it will send a written Notice to the email address used for your membership account.\nA Notice, whether sent by you or by Weee!, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nIf Weee! and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Weee! may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court.</p>\n<p>You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at www.adr.org.\nIf you are required to pay a filing fee, after Weee! receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, Weee! will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US$10,000, in which event you will be responsible for filing fees.</p>\n<p>The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the \"AAA Rules\") of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.\nThe AAA Rules and Forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address.\nThe arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement.\nUnless Weee! and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your residence.\nThe arbitrator's award shall be final and binding on all parties, except (1) for judicial review expressly permitted by law or (2) if the arbitrator's award includes an award of injunctive relief against a party, in which case that party shall have the right to seek judicial review of the injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction that shall not be bound by the arbitrator's application or conclusions of law.</p>\n<p>If your claim is for US$10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.\nIf your claim exceeds US$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision explaining the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.\nIf the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Weee!'s last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if Weee! did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then Weee! will pay you the amount of the award or US$250, whichever is greater.\nExcept as expressly set forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</p>\n<p>YOU AND WEEE! AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nFurther, unless both you and Weee! agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nIf this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Section 14.\nNotice to California Consumers</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Please contact Customer Service through the Help Center on our website if you have concerns, complaints, or feedback.\nFor your reference, the State of California's Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of the Consumer Services of The Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at 400 R Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, or by telephone at (916) 445-1254 or (800) 952-5210.</p>\n<p>As a California resident, under Proposition 65, you are entitled to notice when a Product contains a chemical, listed by and known to the State of California, to which exposure at a significant risk level can increase the risk of cancer and/or to be a reproductive toxicant.\nFor information about Proposition 65, go to www.P65Warnings.ca.gov.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Section 15.\nGoverning Law</strong>\n</p>\n<p>These Terms and any other matters related to or arising from your use of the Services, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware, without resort to its conflict of law principles.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Section 16.\nCustomer Support</strong>\n</p>\n<p>To find more information about our Services, if you need assistance with your account, or have questions about your order, please visit the Weee!
