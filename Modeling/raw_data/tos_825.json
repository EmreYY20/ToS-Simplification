use the Services.\nWe may obtain information by automated means such as through browser cookies, pixels, web server logs, web beacons, and other technologies.\nAmong other purposes, these technologies help us (1) remember your information so you will not have to re-enter it, (2) track and understand how you use and interact with the Services, (3) tailor the Services around your preferences, (4)

www.allaboutcookies.org</u>.\nFor mobile devices, you can manage how your device and browser share certain device data by adjusting the privacy and security settings on your device.\nThe Services are not designed to respond to \u201cdo not track\u201d signals received from browsers.<strong>\n</strong>Please note that without cookies, you may not be able to use or benefit from all of the features of our Services.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\n</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Information Stored on Your Device Not Accessible to Samsung</em>\n</strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In addition to the categories of information obtained by Samsung discussed above, our Services may generate data automatically when you use certain Services (e.g.\nSamsung\u2019s face-clustering technology that allows the device to group together images of the same face from different photographs (\u201cFace-Clustering Data\u201d)), or may utilize data that you generate independently (e.g.\nregistering biometric data such as fingerprints to unlock your device or verify you in certain Services, or when you register your wake-up command in our Bixby Voice service).\nAll of this data remains on the device and is not transmitted to Samsung, nor does Samsung obtain or access this data.\nSamsung does not share this data with third parties.\nFace-Clustering Data will remain on your device until you clear the cache in your system settings, you reset your device to its factory setting, or you delete the photos from your device.\nYou can delete your registered biometric data or your wake-up command from your device at any time in the applicable settings.\nBecause Samsung does not have access to this data, Samsung cannot delete it.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Third-Party Web

time and across third-party websites, devices, apps, and other online features and services.\nWe may use third-party analytics services on the Services, such as Google Analytics and Firebase

services tailored to your individual interests.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Samsung Ads</em>\n</p>\n<p>\nOur Samsung Ads service is designed to serve advertisements that are customized to users\u2019 interests on Samsung and third-party platforms, devices, websites, and apps.\nSamsung Ads may deliver customized ads based on your demographic characteristics, preferences, choices, and

https://www.samsung.com/us/account/privacy-policy/samsungads/ for more information, including information on how to opt out of receiving customized ads from Samsung Ads.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Ad networks</em>\n</p>\n<p>\nBecause Samsung participates in various advertising networks, you may also see our ads on other websites or mobile apps.\nAd networks allow us to target our messaging to users considering demographic data, users\u2019 inferred interests, and browsing context.\nThese networks can track users\u2019 online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of browser cookies, web beacons, pixels, device identifiers, server logs, and other similar technologies.\nThe networks use this information to show ads that may be tailored to individuals\u2019 interests, to track users\u2019 browsers or devices across multiple websites and apps, and to build a profile of users\u2019 online browsing and app usage activities.\nThe information our ad networks may collect includes data about users\u2019 visits to websites and apps that participate in the relevant ad networks, such as the pages or ads viewed and the actions taken on the websites or apps.\nThis data collection takes place both on certain Services and on third-party websites and apps that participate in the ad networks.\nThis process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.\n</p>\n<p> To learn how to opt out of ad network interest-based advertising in the U.S., please visit <u>
