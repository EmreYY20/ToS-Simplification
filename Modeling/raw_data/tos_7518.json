Party\u2019s and its Affiliates\u2019 employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know for purposes consistent with this Agreement, provided they are bound to confidentiality obligations not materially less protective of the Confidential Information than those set out in this section 7 (Confidentiality).\nNeither party will disclose the terms of this Agreement or any Order to any third party other than its Affiliates, legal counsel and accountants without the other party\u2019s prior written consent, provided that a party that makes any such disclosure to its Affiliate, legal counsel or accountants will remain responsible for such Affiliate\u2019s, legal counsel\u2019s or accountant\u2019s compliance with the terms of this section 7 (Confidentiality).\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Deputy may disclose the terms of this Agreement and any applicable Order to a&nbsp;subcontractor or a provider of a Non-Deputy Application to the extent necessary to perform Deputy\u2019s obligations under this Agreement, under terms of confidentiality that are not materially less protective of the Confidential Information than those set out in this section 7 (Confidentiality).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>7.3 Compelled Disclosure.\n</b>The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent compelled by law to do so, but only to the minimum extent required to comply with such law provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of the compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure.\nIf the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing&nbsp;Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that Confidential Information.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>7.4 Promotion and marketing.\n</b>Deputy may

information.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>Deputy Pay Rule Engine<p>\n<b>2.\nAbout Deputy\u2019s Pay Rule Engine</b>\n</p>\n<p>2.1 Deputy contains a pre-configured library of pay rules (<b>Pay Rules</b>) that productize Deputy\u2019s interpretation of certain Australian modern awards, US federal and state wage and hour laws, and similar requirements for certain other jurisdictions (each a <b>Legal Requirement</b>).</p>\n<p>2.2 Each Pay Rule prescribes a set of entitlements that may be due to an employee under applicable Legal Requirements, where that employee\u2019s shift or work pattern satisfies specified criteria.</p>\n<p>2.3 Deputy\u2019s Pay Rules automate the application of a subset of these Legal Requirements by applying them to time and attendance data captured within Deputy.</p>\n<p>2.4 Specifically, when you choose to apply a Pay Rule to an employee\u2019s profile in Deputy, the hours worked by that employee are then categorised by Deputy as, for example, ordinary hours, daily overtime, weekly overtime, or penalty rate hours, based on Deputy\u2019s interpretation of the relevant Legal Requirements.\nSome Pay Rules also automate other entitlements such as missed or delayed meal break penalties, spread of hours premiums, split shift premiums, and the like, as applicable.</p>\n<p>2.5 This functionality of Deputy\u2019s software is known as the <b>Pay Rule Engine</b>.</p>\n<p>2.6 Our online<b>\n</b>\n<b>Pay Rule Library</b> sets out the Pay Rules available within the Pay Rule Engine.\nYou may also view the specifications for each Pay Rule within the Deputy platform itself in the Pay Rule dropdown menu in your employee profiles.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>3.\nCompliance responsibility</b>\n</p>\n<p>While the Pay Rule Engine is designed to Simplify Shift Work by reducing the time required to apply the relevant Legal Requirements through automation, it is not a substitute for payroll or legal advice, nor is it intended to relieve you of your obligation to comply with the Legal Requirements applicable to your business.\nIt is ultimately each customer\u2019s sole responsibility to pay its employees correctly and in compliance with all Legal Requirements.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>4.\nIt\u2019s important that you familiarise yourself with our help documents</b>\n</p>\n<p>Our online<b>\n</b>\n<b>Pay Rule Library</b> (referred to in these terms as our <b>help documents</b>) plays an important role in your use of the Pay Rule Engine.\nLet us explain:</p>\n<p>4.1 The Legal Requirements are inherently complex.\nFor example, in some cases, there is in-built optionality (such as the ways that an employer may define an employee\u2019s ordinary hours), and scope for more than one interpretation in a given situation.</p>\n<p>4.2 Not all aspects of the Legal Requirements are automated within the Pay Rule Engine.\nOur help documents specify which Legal Requirements are automated within the Pay Rule Engine.\nDeputy\u2019s Pay Rules reflect Deputy\u2019s good faith interpretation of the Legal Requirements and are not a substitute for legal advice.</p>\n<p>4.3 It is important that you familiarise yourself with the help documents (and relevant Legal Requirements) to ensure you understand what requirements Deputy\u2019s Pay Rule Engine does and does not automate, together with the interpretations Deputy has applied to the Legal Requirements, so that you can confirm if these are suitable for your business.</p>\n<p>4.4 Our help documents are regularly updated to reflect the latest Updates in the Pay Rule Engine.\nYou should regularly check back for current information.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>5.\nImportant responsibilities</b>\n</p>\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that it is your sole responsibility:</p>\n<p>5.1 to determine which Legal Requirements apply to each of your employees;</p>\n<p>5.2 to validate if Deputy\u2019s automated Pay Rules are suitable for the particular circumstances of your business (see section 4, above);</p>\n<p>5.3 to set the base rate of pay for each of your employees within their employee profile in Deputy.\nThe Pay Rule Engine will use that base rate of pay when applying the Pay Rules;</p>\n<p>5.4 to review the outputs and calculations generated by the Pay Rule Engine for each pay period and before processing payroll, to validate that each of your employees are being paid in accordance with the applicable Legal Requirements;</p>\n<p>5.5 if your employees are subject to Legal Requirements that are not automated in the Pay Rule Engine, to separately account for those Legal Requirements when processing your payroll.\nand</p>\n<p>5.6 if you identify errors in the outputs or calculations generated by the Pay Rule Engine, to rectify them to ensure your Employees are paid correctly and to promptly notify Deputy of any such errors.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>6.\nLiability</b>\n</p>\n<p>6.1 While Deputy takes all reasonable care to provide a quality Pay Rule Engine, it does not warrant or guarantee the accuracy, completeness or up to date nature of the engine, that it will be error free or suitable for the particular circumstances of your business.</p>\n<p>6.2 You are advised to consult with your legal and payroll advisers before relying on the Pay Rule Engine and to the extent permitted by law, Deputy disclaims liability for (and you release Deputy from) any and all Losses arising from or in connection with your use of or reliance on the Pay Rule Engine to calculate employee entitlements or otherwise, or from any errors, inaccuracies, incompleteness or defects in the Pay Rule Engine.</p>\n<p>6.3 To the extent that such liability cannot lawfully be excluded, Deputy limits its liability in the manner specified in section 8.4 of the Agreement.</p>\n<p>6.4 In this section, <b>Losses</b> means all claims, actions, expenses, losses or damages however arising, including but not limited to any under or over payment of employees.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>7.\nCustom configurations</b>\n</p>\n<p>Deputy may, in a separate professional services agreement, produce a custom Pay Rule in Deputy based on specifications provided or approved by a particular customer.\nThose custom configurations are deemed part of the Pay Rule Engine for the purposes of these terms.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>8.\nUpdates to the Pay Rule Engine</b>\n</p>\n<p>Deputy is continuously evolving and improving its Pay Rule Engine and may modify, update, make corrections and/or enhance it from time to time (<b>Updates</b>).\nUpdates will be reflected in the help documents and are not separately notified to individual customers.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p> Simplify shift work
