(Information)</strong>is information that identifies you as a specific person or can identify you for interaction with you.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>User</strong>is an identifiable or non-identifiable individual who interacts with Messenger.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>CCPA</strong> (California Consumer Privacy Act)is a California statute designed to increase privacy rights and consumer protections for residents of California and the United States.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Cookies </strong>are small text files that store information about your previous activities on the Dober Web site.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>GDPR </strong> - General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), which applies to the regulation of personal data processing as of May 25, 2018.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Business Accoun</strong>- is a User's (Business Client's) account that allows to use Messenger as a closed communication channel, available only to employees of such a Business Client or authorized users whose access is only allowed by this Business Client.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Personal Account</strong>- registered Dober User's account.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Business Account Server</strong>- is a physical or cloud-based server purchased or leased by the Business Account Owner (Business Client) on which the Dober software will be deployed and where all of the Business Client's information will be stored.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Public Server</strong>- Dober leased or purchased, physical or cloud-based server on which all Personal Account data and Dober software are stored.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>PERSONAL DATA THAT WE COLLECT AND STORE</strong>\n<p>Business Account and Personal Account Messenger options are available in Dober.\nYou can read more about this in the DoberTerms of Use.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Personal data collected voluntarily at the initiative of Users.\nWhen a User creates a Personal Account to use Messenger</strong>We collect User's Personal Data that identifies you as an individual, necessary to create and maintain a User account, and transfer information within Messenger in connection with the use of it.\nUser's Personal information includes:<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Login, account name, and pseudonym (nickname)</strong>To register your account, you will need to come up with a username - a unique name for your account, which you will enter every time you log in to your account on any of your devices, to identify you as a User.\nDo not disclose your username to any third party to prevent the possibility of your account being compromised.\nYou can add a name (the name under which other users will see you in the messenger address book, the User name is not unique and may coincide with the names of other Users) and a nickname (a unique identifier by which other Users will be able to find you in the messenger database).\nNote that your name and nickname will be publicly available to other Users.\nDober does not require your name and/or nickname to match your actual name.\nThe name and nickname may be fictitious and chosen at your discretion..</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Password and pin code</strong>.To register an account, the User must come up with a password that will secure login to the account on any User's device and a pin code that protects against other Users opening the Messenger, with no integration with Android and iOS security mechanisms.\nDober processes passwords, but does not store them.\nThe password hash is also not stored, making it impossible to reverse-engineer a User's password.\nWhen creating a password, remember that the more complex the password, the stronger the cryptographic protection of correspondence in Dober will be.\nDober does not process or store the User's pin code.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Secret Q&amp;A</strong>.When registering an account, User can fill out additional information to regain access to the account if the password is lost.\nIf User does not create password recovery information and, the password is lost, the account will no longer be available without the possibility of password recovery.\nDo not disclose the answers to the password recovery questions to third parties to prevent the possibility of your account being compromised.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Public Key</strong>.\nEach User has its own public and private key.\nThe public key is one of the two parts of a key pair used in public key cryptography, also known as end-to-end encryption, and is used to encrypt a message or data.\nDober stores and processes the public key.\nThe private key, on the other hand, is kept secret and used only by the owner to decrypt messages encrypted by end-to-end encryption.\nWith end-to-end encryption, the public key encrypts the data and the private key decrypts it.When sending a message through Messenger, the sender generates a SHA3-512 symmetric key, which is used to encrypt the message with a public key, which is stored on the Public Server or Business Account Server.\nThe message's recipient decrypts the symmetric key with the private key, which is decrypted with the password.\nDober generates a unique symmetric key for each message.Generation of a unique symmetric key for each message provides an additional level of security during data transmission.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Profile Images</strong>.\nYou can add a profile picture to personalize your account, Dober does not require your profile picture to match your actual appearance and to be your personal photo.\nPlease note that your profile image is always publicly available to other Users and is stored on the Public Server and Business Account Server in an unencrypted form.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Audio, video, documents and messages</strong>.\nWe store messages, photos, videos and documents you upload to your cloud chats in Messenger, so you can access your data on your devices at any time without relying on backups.\nData is stored encrypted and only available to the sender and recipient.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Metadata</strong>.\nDober may receive and store data connected with your use of the features or Dober functions: login, correspondence, call, video, photo, and the date and time of your call in Dober, to enhance the security of your account and to prevent spam, abuse and other violations of our Terms of Use.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Personal information collected automatically</strong>.\nWhen interacting with Messenger, some information about Users is automatically collected from a computer or mobile device.<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Server Logs</strong>.\nOur Public Servers automatically collect data when you use Messenger and record it.\nDober may collect Personal Information such as: your IP address, to understand the country you are connecting from when you use Messenger, your time zone setting, information about the device and browser type you use to access Messenger, the URL of the website from which you visited Messenger, third party sites you visit to log out of Messenger, and your language settings.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Device data</strong>.\nDober collects data about the devices Messenger is used on, including device type, installed operating system, device settings, application identifiers, and failure data.\nDevice data is stored on the Public Server in encrypted form and is available only to the User, the owner of the login and password owner.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Location Data</strong>.\nWe receive data from Users to help us to understand your approximate location (the location of the device from which a User connects to Messenger).\nFor example, Dober may determine your approximate location to assist with localisation.\nLocation data is stored on the Public Server in encrypted form and is available only to the User who owns the login and password.\nDober does not track Users by their GPS.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Time and date information</strong>.\nDober collects information about the date and time the account was created, as well as the date and time the account was last logged into Messenger, to provide the User with session information that protects and controls the account from unauthorized logins.</li>\n<li>Messenger allows to create a Business Account, access to which is provided by the Dober User (Business Client), the owner of such a Business Account, to other Users.\nIn addition, the Business Client may use its own Business Account Server to store, process Personal Information of Business Account Users who have access to it.</li>\n<li>When a User creates a Business Account in Messenger: We do not collect data from a Business User (Business Client) who uses Messenger as a closed channel of communication available only to the Business Account Users to whom the Business Client has granted access to such a Business Account.Business Client uses its Business Account Server to store, process

specified in clauses 2.1.1.\n2.1.1.\nto 2.1.7.\nof the Policy as when creating a Personal Account.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Dober</strong> does not collect or store the data of Business Account Users.\nSuch Users receive access to Messenger from the Business Account Creator - Business Client, who collects, stores and processes such Users' personal data on the Business Account Server.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Dober</strong> does not use phone numbers as identifiers to create and authorize an account, or to log in to an account by sending an SMS with a code.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Dober</strong> does not use or solicit email from Users to create and authorize an account or recover a password.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Dober</strong> does not integrate with the User's device phone book.\nHowever, the Users always have access to information about the device from which they used Messenger and can end the session on such a device.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Dober</strong> does not collect or process special categories of User`s Personal Data (sensitive data), such as information about race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual life and orientation, political views, trade union membership, health information, and genetic and biometric data.\nWe also do not collect information about Users'

in any violation of laws (fraud or other crime or offense) or regulations, or has been accessed illegally, or the account is otherwise involved in suspicious activity (whether as a victim, suspect, violator or otherwise), Dober may block the User Account.</li>\n<li>Users may send complaints to Dober about fraudulent or other criminal activity by other Users, such data will be processed by Dober to identify suspicious, illegal activity by Users.\nTo send a complaint Users must specify the reason for the complaint by selecting a category of violation from those offered: child abuse, drugs, personal information, pornography, spam, violence, others.</li>\n<li>If the User is suspected of violating any applicable law, Dober will cooperate with law enforcement authorities as

registration and Account creation is governed by Dober`s Privacy Policy..</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Dober</strong> allows you to create two types of Accounts:.<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Personal Account</strong> - Dober`s registered User account.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Business-Account</strong> - User (Business-Client) account that provides the ability to use Messenger as a closed communication channel, available only to employees of such Business-Client or authorized users whose access is authorized by the Business-Client.<ol>\n<li>The Business-Client uses the Business-Account Server to store data.\nBusiness-Client designates a Business-Account Server Administrator who pre-creates accounts for Users who will access the Business-Account.\nThe Administrator provides Users with a created username and password for the initial login to the account, as well as a server address to connect to.\nUser`s logins may be agreed upon by the Administrator with the Users in advance.\nThe standard Business-account user password is not available to anyone other than that User and the Administrator.\nAfter logging into the Business-account User must change the standard password to his unique password, which will be known only to such User.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>To create an Account, the User must fill out registration information, such as login, password, User name and nickname.<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Login</strong>.\nThe user must create and enter a login, which will be the Account identifier.\nCreating a login you can use latin letters, signs and symbols from 1 to 128, including \"underscore\", at the same time, special characters and signs as \"@\", \"space\" and dot \".\" in the login are not allowed.\nUsing only symbols or only numbers in your login is not allowed.\nLogin cannot be changed after an Account registration.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Password</strong>.\nThe User must create a password that can consist of any number of characters and symbols, the minimum password size is one character.\nIt is allowed to use any language by creating a password.\nAfter entering and confirming the Account password, the User shall confirm consent in a pop-up window (pop-up) that he/she is familiar with and agrees with the importance of the created password.\nIf the User does not confirm the consent, Account registration is not possible.\nDober does not check the difficulty level of the password, but as the User enters the password, Dober may indicate such level.\nDober recommends creating a strong password and not to use common words or character sets that are easy to guess or guest-select as passwords.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>User Name</strong>.\nThe User enters an Account name that will appear in the other User's address book.\nYou can use any language and any number of characters from 2 to 128 to create a User Name.\nIn case you need to change the User name, you can change it in \"Account Settings\".</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Nickname</strong>.\nA unique Account code name , by which other Users can find your Account in the Messenger global search.\nThe Nickname must consist of characters, signs and latin letters from 1 to 128, you cannot create a Nickname that consists only of characters/signs/digits.\nThe use of \"underscores\" is allowed.\nThe Nickname can't coincide with the login and can't include special characters and spaces.\nIf you create a Nickname that is already used by another User, you won't be able to choose and create an identical one.\nIf you need to change your Nickname, you can change it in \u201cAccount Settings\u201d.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Server</strong>.\nTo register a Business-Account, the User must enter a server address that corresponds to the server on which the Business -Account User`s data will be stored.\nAfter entering the server address, the Business -Account User fills in the same registration details as the Personal Account User, namely: login, password, User name and nickname.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Dober has no control over, and has no obligation to control your registration information and/or the security of your password.\nYou are responsible for the security of your password as well as the security of your device to restrict access to your Account by third parties.</li>\n<li>Dober has functionality to identify the Account true owner .\nThis functionality can also allow the User to restore the account in the case of password losing.\nBy using the appropriate features in the account settings, the User may create and specify a Secret word or Character set that is known only to the User and to Dober Support.\nThe Secret word/Character set of Account identification is not a Secret Question-Answer, as it is described in Section 7 of these Terms of Use.\nIn order to change a password or for any other request related to the Account, the User's identity and ownership of the Account may be verified by providing the Secret Word/Character Set to Dober Support, which, in their turn, will indicate that the request is more likely to come from a valid Account owner and can be fulfilled.\nThe Secret word/Character set is not required when registering a User's Account and may be added by the User at any time by using the Dober Account settings.</li>\n<li>You are responsible for all activities that occur under your Messenger Account.\nYou agree to notify Dober about any unauthorized use of your Account or any security breach of your Account immediately, including password use (cracking).</li>\n<li>Dober is not liable for any losses you may incur as a result of someone else using your Account, with or without your knowledge.\nIn addition, you may be held liable for any losses incurred by us or another party as a result of someone else using your Account.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>SECRET QUESTION-ANSWER AND PIN CODE</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Secret Question-Answer</strong>.\nAfter registering an Account, Users are encouraged to create an additional \"question,\" \"answer\" and \"hint\" to regain access to the Account in the event of a password loss (the \"Secret Question and Answer\").\nYou may refuse to create such a Secret Question-Answer, in which case Dober will not be responsible for restoring access to your Account.\nIn the event that you lose access to an Account because you lose your password, Dober will not be able to restore or provide access to such Account and the data associated with it.</li>\n<li>To create a Secret Question-Answer after registering an Account, the User needs to fill in the lines \"question\", \"answer\" and \"hint\".\nYou can use an unlimited number of symbols and characters.</li>\n<li>When regaining access to an Account, the User must enter the full Secret Question-Answer data, including spaces, characters, language, numbers and all characters that they used when creating such Secret Question-Answer.\nThe hint that is created to help you answer the Secret Question-Answer is stored on the server in the unencrypted form so we do not recommend you to write the full answer to the Secret Question-Answer in the hint.</li>\n<li>If the User did not create a Secret Question-Answer at the registration stage, forgot this information or did not create a hint to restore it, to change the Secret Question-Answer the User must go to \"Account Settings\" and change the current password by selecting \"Change Password\", enter the current Account password, then select and fill out the new Secret Question-Answer.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Pin Code</strong>.\nTo provide additional protection to the Account, Users can create a pin code to log in to Messenger.\nThe minimum number of characters for a pin code is 4 (four), Dober does not limit the maximum number of characters and symbols you can use when creating a pin code.</li>\n<li>Pin code will be requested each time you sign in to Messenger as an additional way to protect against third party access to your Account and the data stored in it.\nPin code is not connected to your face id and/or any other method of biometric identification.\nIn case you do not want to enter the pin code every time you sign in to Messenger, you can save it by clicking \"save code\" in the pop-up window.\nThen the pin code will be saved and you will be able to enter Messenger without filling it every time.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>SUBSCRIPTION AND PAYMENT</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>Dober is a free of charge Messenger, so the User does

blocked a User, you will not receive messages from him.\nAt the same time, Messenger does not notify the Users that they have been blocked, so your correspondence may be from the blocked User`s one
