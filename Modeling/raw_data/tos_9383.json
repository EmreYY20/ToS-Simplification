being collected, used, disclosed and stored by&nbsp;us, as&nbsp;described in&nbsp;our Terms of&nbsp;Use<strong>, EULA</strong>&nbsp;and in&nbsp;this <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>b) Information we&nbsp;collect automatically:</strong> When you use the Services or&nbsp;browse one of&nbsp;our Websites, we&nbsp;may collect information about your visit to&nbsp;our Websites, your usage of&nbsp;the Services, and your web browsing.\nThat information may include your&nbsp;IP address, your operating system, your browser&nbsp;ID, your browsing activity, and other information about how you interacted with our Websites or&nbsp;other websites.\nWe&nbsp;may collect this information as&nbsp;a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;log files as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;through the use of&nbsp;cookies or&nbsp;other tracking technologies.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>c) Information from your use of&nbsp;the Service:</strong> We&nbsp;may receive information about how and when you use the Services, store it&nbsp;in&nbsp;log files or&nbsp;other types of&nbsp;files associated with your account, and link it&nbsp;to&nbsp;other information we&nbsp;collect about you.\nThis information may include, for example, your&nbsp;IP address, time, date, browser used, and actions you have taken within the application.\nThis type of&nbsp;information helps&nbsp;us to&nbsp;improve our Services for both you and for all of&nbsp;our users.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>e) Cookies and tracking:</strong> Cookies are small data files that are placed on&nbsp;your computer or&nbsp;mobile device when you visit a&nbsp;website.\nCookies are widely used by&nbsp;online service providers in&nbsp;order&nbsp;to (for example) make their websites or&nbsp;services work, or&nbsp;to&nbsp;work more efficiently, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;to&nbsp;provide reporting information.</p>\n<p>Cookies set by&nbsp;the website owner or&nbsp;service provider (in&nbsp;this case, FlippingBook) are called \u201cfirst-party cookies\u201d.\nCookies set by&nbsp;parties other than the website owner are called \u201cthird-party cookies\u201d.\nThird-party cookies enable third-party features or&nbsp;functionality to&nbsp;be&nbsp;provided on&nbsp;or&nbsp;through the website or&nbsp;service you are using (such as&nbsp;advertising, interactive content, and analytics).\nThe third parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it&nbsp;visits the website or&nbsp;service in&nbsp;question and also when it&nbsp;visits certain other websites or&nbsp;services.</p>\n<p>We&nbsp;use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons.\nSome cookies are required for technical reasons in&nbsp;order for our Websites and Services to&nbsp;operate, and we&nbsp;refer to&nbsp;these as&nbsp;\u201cessential\u201d or&nbsp;\u201cstrictly necessary\u201d cookies.\nOther cookies enable&nbsp;us and the third parties we&nbsp;work with to&nbsp;track and target the interests of&nbsp;visitors to&nbsp;our Websites, and we&nbsp;refer to&nbsp;these as&nbsp;\u201cperformance\u201d or&nbsp;\u201cfunctionality\u201d cookies.\nFor example, we&nbsp;use cookies to&nbsp;tailor content and information that we&nbsp;may send or&nbsp;display to&nbsp;you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to&nbsp;otherwise improve the functionality of&nbsp;the Services we&nbsp;provide.\nWe&nbsp;also enable our users to&nbsp;employ cookies and similar tracking technologies in&nbsp;connection with their use of&nbsp;our Services in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;allow&nbsp;us and our users to&nbsp;track their viewers.\nFinally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.\nThis is&nbsp;described in&nbsp;more detail below.</p>\n<p>The specific types of&nbsp;first and third-party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in&nbsp;further detail below:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Essential Website Cookies:</strong> These cookies are strictly necessary to&nbsp;provide you with services available through our websites and to&nbsp;use some of&nbsp;its features, such as&nbsp;access to&nbsp;secure areas.\nBecause these cookies are strictly necessary to&nbsp;deliver the websites, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our websites function.\nYou can block or&nbsp;delete them by&nbsp;changing your browser settings, as&nbsp;described under the heading \u201cYou have the right to&nbsp;decide whether to&nbsp;accept or&nbsp;reject cookies:\u201d below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Performance and Functionality Cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to&nbsp;enhance the performance and functionality of&nbsp;our websites but are non-essential to&nbsp;their use.\nHowever, without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Analytics and Customization Cookies:</strong> These cookies collect information that is&nbsp;used either in&nbsp;aggregate form to&nbsp;help&nbsp;us understand how our websites are being used or&nbsp;how effective our marketing campaigns are, or&nbsp;to&nbsp;help&nbsp;us customize our websites and application for you in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;enhance your experience.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Advertising (Targeting) Cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to&nbsp;make advertising messages more relevant to&nbsp;you and your interests.\nThey also perform functions like preventing the same ad&nbsp;from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in&nbsp;some cases selecting advertisements that are based on&nbsp;your interests.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Other tracking technologies:</strong> We&nbsp;and our third-party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to&nbsp;time, like web beacons, pixels (or&nbsp;\u201cclear gifs\u201d) and other tracking technologies.\nThese are tiny graphics files that contain a&nbsp;unique identifier that enable&nbsp;us to&nbsp;recognize when someone has visited our Websites&nbsp;or, in&nbsp;the case of&nbsp;web beacons, opened an&nbsp;email that we&nbsp;have sent them.\nThis allows&nbsp;us, for example, to&nbsp;monitor the traffic patterns of&nbsp;users from one page within our Websites to&nbsp;another, to&nbsp;deliver or&nbsp;communicate with cookies, to&nbsp;understand whether you have come to&nbsp;our Websites from an&nbsp;online advertisement displayed on&nbsp;a&nbsp;third-party website, to&nbsp;serve targeted advertisements to&nbsp;you and others like you, to&nbsp;improve site performance, and to&nbsp;measure the success of&nbsp;marketing campaigns.\nWhile you may not have the ability to&nbsp;specifically reject or&nbsp;disable these tracking technologies, in&nbsp;many instances, these technologies are reliant on&nbsp;cookies to&nbsp;function properly.\naccordingly, in&nbsp;those instances, declining cookies will impair the functioning of&nbsp;these technologies.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Targeted online advertising:</strong> We&nbsp;have engaged one or&nbsp;more third-party service providers to&nbsp;track and analyze both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites.\nWe&nbsp;also partner with one or&nbsp;more third parties (such as&nbsp;advertisers and ad&nbsp;networks) to&nbsp;manage and serve to&nbsp;advertise on&nbsp;other sites.</p>\n<p>These third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to&nbsp;collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on&nbsp;our Websites and/or other sites or&nbsp;mobile apps, to&nbsp;infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to&nbsp;you based on&nbsp;your browsing activities and inferred interests (\u201cInterest-Based Advertising\u201d).\nFor more information about this practice, click here: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.</p>\n<p>Our third-party service providers may also use cookies or&nbsp;web beacons to&nbsp;collect information about your visits to&nbsp;our Websites and/or other sites to&nbsp;measure and track the effectiveness of&nbsp;advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by&nbsp;collecting data on&nbsp;how many times you click on&nbsp;one of&nbsp;our ads).\nThe information collected by&nbsp;these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to&nbsp;be&nbsp;specifically identified (e.g.&nbsp;by&nbsp;reference to&nbsp;your name or&nbsp;email address).</p>\n<p>If&nbsp;a&nbsp;user elects to&nbsp;use certain FlippingBook features, the use of&nbsp;those may permit or&nbsp;require additional cookies or&nbsp;tracking technologies to&nbsp;be&nbsp;employed.\nIf&nbsp;a&nbsp;user connects his or&nbsp;her website (in&nbsp;each case, a&nbsp;\u201cSite\u201d) to&nbsp;a&nbsp;FlippingBook account, FlippingBook adds cookies and tracking technologies on&nbsp;that user\u2019s Site.\nThis will help to&nbsp;facilitate the use of&nbsp;certain automation, features, and functionality offered by&nbsp;FlippingBook through the Services.\nThe specific cookies, pixels, or&nbsp;other technologies that will be&nbsp;set on&nbsp;a&nbsp;user\u2019s Site depend on&nbsp;the particular features that the user chooses to&nbsp;use as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the Services.\nViewers should, therefore, review the relevant user\u2019s privacy notice and cookie disclosures for further information about the specific types of&nbsp;cookies and other tracking technologies used on&nbsp;the Site.</p>\n<p>You have the right to&nbsp;decide whether to&nbsp;accept or&nbsp;reject cookies:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Browser Controls:</strong> You can set or&nbsp;amend your web browser controls to&nbsp;accept or&nbsp;refuse cookies.\nIf&nbsp;you choose to&nbsp;reject cookies, you may still use our Websites through your access to&nbsp;some functionality and areas of&nbsp;our Websites may be&nbsp;restricted.\nAs&nbsp;the means by&nbsp;which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser\u2019s help menu for more information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Disabling Most Interest-Based Advertising:</strong> Most advertising networks offer you a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;opt out of&nbsp;Interest-Based Advertising.\nIf&nbsp;you would like to&nbsp;find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or&nbsp;http://www.youronlinechoices.com.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Mobile Advertising:</strong> You can opt out of&nbsp;having your mobile advertising identifiers used for certain types of&nbsp;Interest-Based Advertising, including those performed by&nbsp;us, by&nbsp;accessing the settings in&nbsp;your Apple or&nbsp;Android mobile device and following the most recent published instructions.\nIf&nbsp;you opt out, we&nbsp;will remove all data about you and no&nbsp;further data collection or&nbsp;tracking will occur.\nThe random ID&nbsp;we (or&nbsp;our third-party partners) had previously assigned to&nbsp;you will also be&nbsp;removed.\nThis means that if&nbsp;at&nbsp;a&nbsp;later stage, you decide to&nbsp;opt-in, we&nbsp;will not be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;continue and track you using the same ID&nbsp;as before, and you will for all practical purposes be&nbsp;a&nbsp;new user to&nbsp;our system.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Do&nbsp;Not Track:</strong> Some Internet browsers&nbsp;\u2014 like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari&nbsp;\u2014 include the ability to&nbsp;transmit \u201cDo&nbsp;Not Track\u201d or&nbsp;\u201cDNT\u201d signals.\nSince uniform standards for \u201cDNT\u201d signals have not been adopted, our Websites do&nbsp;not currently process or&nbsp;respond to&nbsp;\u201cDNT\u201d signals.\nFlippingBook takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of&nbsp;a&nbsp;standard.\nTo&nbsp;learn more about \u201cDNT\u201d, please visit All About Do&nbsp;Not Track.</p>\n<p>If&nbsp;you have any questions about our use of&nbsp;cookies or&nbsp;other technologies, please email&nbsp;us at&nbsp;privacy@flippingbook.com</p>\n<p>\n<strong>f)</strong>\n<strong>Web beacons:</strong> We&nbsp;use web beacons on&nbsp;our Websites and in&nbsp;our emails.\nWhen we&nbsp;send emails to&nbsp;Users, we&nbsp;may track behavior such as&nbsp;who opened the emails and who clicked the links.\nThis allows&nbsp;us to&nbsp;measure the performance of&nbsp;our email campaigns and to&nbsp;improve our features for specific segments of&nbsp;Users.\nTo&nbsp;do&nbsp;this, we&nbsp;include single-pixel gifs, also called web beacons, in&nbsp;emails we&nbsp;send.\nWeb beacons allow&nbsp;us to&nbsp;collect information about when you open the email, your&nbsp;IP address, your browser or&nbsp;email client type, and other similar details.\nWe&nbsp;also include Web Beacons in&nbsp;the emails we&nbsp;deliver for you.\nWe&nbsp;use the data from those Web Beacons to&nbsp;create reports about how our email campaign performed and what actions have you taken.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>g)</strong>\n<strong>Information from other sources:</strong> From time to&nbsp;time we&nbsp;may obtain information about you from third-party sources, such as&nbsp;public databases, social media platforms, third-party data providers and our joint marketing partners.\nWe&nbsp;take steps to&nbsp;ensure that such third parties are legally permitted or&nbsp;required to&nbsp;disclose such information to&nbsp;us.\nExamples of&nbsp;the information we&nbsp;may receive from other sources include demographic information, device information (such as&nbsp;IP addresses), location, and online behavioral data (such as&nbsp;information about your use of&nbsp;social media websites, page view information and search results and links).\nWe&nbsp;use this information, alone or&nbsp;in&nbsp;combination with other information (including Personal Information) we&nbsp;collect, to&nbsp;enhance our ability to&nbsp;provide relevant marketing and content to&nbsp;you and to&nbsp;develop and provide you with more relevant products features, and services.</p>\n6.\nUse and Disclosure of&nbsp;Personal Information\n<p>We&nbsp;may use and disclose Personal Information only for the following purposes:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>a) To&nbsp;promote the use of&nbsp;our services to&nbsp;you and others.</strong> For example, if&nbsp;we&nbsp;collect your Personal Information when you visit our Website and do&nbsp;not sign up&nbsp;for any of&nbsp;the Services, we&nbsp;may send you an&nbsp;email inviting you to&nbsp;sign&nbsp;up.\nIf&nbsp;you use any of&nbsp;our Services and we&nbsp;think you might benefit from using another Service we&nbsp;offer, we&nbsp;may send you an&nbsp;email about that.\nYou can stop receiving our promotional emails by&nbsp;following the unsubscribe instructions included in&nbsp;every email we&nbsp;send.\nIn&nbsp;addition, we&nbsp;may use the information we&nbsp;collect in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;advertise our Services to&nbsp;you or&nbsp;suggest additional features of&nbsp;our Services that you might consider using.\nIn&nbsp;addition, we&nbsp;may use your Personal Information to&nbsp;advertise our Services to&nbsp;potential or&nbsp;other users like you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>b) To&nbsp;send you informational and promotional content in&nbsp;accordance with your marketing preferences.</strong> You can stop receiving our promotional emails by&nbsp;following the unsubscribe instructions included in&nbsp;every email.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>c) To bill and collect money owed to&nbsp;us by&nbsp;our Users.</strong> This includes sending you emails, invoices, receipts, notices of&nbsp;delinquency, and alerting you if&nbsp;we&nbsp;need a&nbsp;different credit card number.\nWe&nbsp;use third parties for secure credit card transaction processing, and we&nbsp;send billing information to&nbsp;those third parties to&nbsp;process your orders and credit card payments.\nTo&nbsp;learn more about the steps we&nbsp;take to&nbsp;safeguard that data, see Section 14&nbsp;below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>d) To&nbsp;send you System Alert messages.</strong> For example, we&nbsp;may inform you of&nbsp;temporary or&nbsp;permanent changes to&nbsp;our Services, such as&nbsp;planned outages, new features, version updates, releases, abuse warnings, and changes to&nbsp;our Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>e) </strong>To&nbsp;communicate with our Users about their account and provide customer support<strong>.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>f) To&nbsp;enforce compliance with our Terms of&nbsp;Use, EULA, and applicable law.</strong> This may include developing tools and algorithms that help&nbsp;us prevent violations.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>g) </strong>To&nbsp;protect the rights and safety of&nbsp;our Users and third parties, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;our own<strong>.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>h) </strong>To&nbsp;meet legal requirements, including complying with court orders, valid discovery requests, valid subpoenas, and other appropriate legal mechanisms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>i)</strong> To&nbsp;provide information to&nbsp;representatives and advisors, including attorneys and accountants,

proceeding.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>k)</strong> To&nbsp;respond to&nbsp;lawful requests by&nbsp;public authorities, including to&nbsp;meet national security or&nbsp;law enforcement requirements.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>l) To&nbsp;provide, support, and improve the Services we&nbsp;offer.</strong> This includes our use of&nbsp;the data that our Users provide&nbsp;us in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;enable our Users to&nbsp;use the Services.\nThis also includes, for example, aggregating information from your use of&nbsp;the Services or&nbsp;visit our Websites and sharing this information with third parties to&nbsp;improve our Services.\nWhen we&nbsp;do&nbsp;have to&nbsp;share Personal Information with third parties, we&nbsp;take steps to&nbsp;protect your information by&nbsp;requiring these third parties to&nbsp;enter into a&nbsp;contract with&nbsp;us that requires them to&nbsp;use the Personal Information we&nbsp;transfer to&nbsp;them in&nbsp;a&nbsp;manner that is&nbsp;consistent with this policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>m)</strong>\n<strong>To&nbsp;transfer your information in&nbsp;the case of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sale, merger, consolidation, liquidation, reorganization,

notify you of&nbsp;the change either by&nbsp;sending you an&nbsp;email or&nbsp;posting a&nbsp;notice on&nbsp;our Website.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Combined Information:</strong> We&nbsp;may combine Personal
