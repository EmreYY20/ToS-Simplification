collection (up to \u00a3100 in some cases) which will be notified to you at the time of cancellation.</p>\n<p>You must inform us of the cancellation of the contract.</p>\n<p>This is not intended to be a full statement of all your rights under the The Consumer Contracts Regulationsl details of your rights under The Consumer Contracts Regulations are available from your Local Citizens' Advice Bureau or your Local Authority's Trading Standards Office.</p>\n<p>The Regulations do not apply to flowers and plant gifts, made to order curtains, made to measure shirts or fresh hampers.</p>\n<p>back to questions</p> WEEE legislation <p>Since 1 July 2007, the UK's Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Regulations allow members of the public to deposit old electrical and electronic items at recycling sites across the UK, free of charge.</p>\n<p>Electrical and Electronic Equipment is one of the fastest growing waste streams in the UK, increasing by at least 5% each year.\nThe public dispose of over 1.2 million tonnes of waste every year in the UK, and landfill sites are now reaching full capacity.\nMuch of this waste can be recycled, and the resources recovered to make new consumer goods.\nThe WEEE regulations aim to reduce the quantity of electrical and electronic items disposed of in this way, and will encourage everyone to play a part in protecting our environment for future generations.</p>\n<p>To find your nearest recycling sites for waste electrical and electronic products, contact your local council, or visit www.recycle-more.co.uk and type your postcode into the recycling bank locator.</p>\n<p>As retailers of electrical and electronic products, Ethical Superstore have chosen to offer a free 'take back' service to our customers.</p>\n<p>Customers can dispose of Electricals by sending them to us (i) on a like-for-like basis when they buy a new or equivalent item, or, (ii) for all types of WEEE that have been purchased from us.\nAt Ethical Superstore we adopt a reasonable interpretation of equivalence.\nFor example, a customer is allowed to send back an old portable CD player when purchasing a new MP3 player as even though this is not strictly a like for-like replacement, the new product is intended to fulfil the same function.</p>\n<p>Customers may wish to return WEEE, on a like-for-like basis, sometime after purchasing the new item e.g.\nif there is a need to make a change over from old to new equipment, we will accept WEEE for a reasonable period following the sale \u2013 i.e.\n28 days.</p>\n<p>We cannot accept any product including personal data for recycling.\nYou will need to have removed any personal data from your old product prior to us receiving it as once received we will not carry out any data removal.</p>\n<p>The products that we currently sell that will be affected are light-bulbs and electrical equipment.</p>\n<p>Under the WEEE Regulations, all new electrical goods should now be marked with the crossed-out wheeled bin symbol as shown.\n</p>\n<p>Goods are marked with this symbol to show that they were produced after 13th August 2005, and should be disposed of separately from normal household waste so that they can be recycled.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To return WEEE to us, please also enclose a covering letter with details of your Order Number, Name and Address to:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ethical Superstore<br>Follingsby Avenue<br>Follingbsy Park<br>Gateshead<br>NE10 8HQ</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>back to questions</p> About Us <ul>\n<li>Our vision
