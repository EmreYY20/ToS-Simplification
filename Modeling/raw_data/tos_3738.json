Liability</li>\n<li>Disclaimer</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<br>Opening Statement<p>Gather does its best to make sure your data is safe and that your privacy is respected.</p>\n<p>This starts with us internally acknowledging and understanding any incentives that we might have that might be misaligned with the health and interests of our users.\nWe then try to minimize or counteract those incentives so that we can systematically be trusted to make the right choices as often as possible.\nThis approach applies not just to our incentives as an organization or as a company, but also as a team and as individuals.</p>\n<p>This attention to our alignment with our users shows up both in our choice of what ideas to pursue and also in the implementation of those ideas.\nWe design our services to use the minimum amount of data needed for us to provide those services and to minimize how much of that data has to pass through our own servers or stay in storage.\nWe also strive to use and design technologies and user interfaces that make it really clear to our users how our systems work.</p>\n<p>Implementing all of this is a never-ending process and we have a lot of work left to do just to reach our current targets for user safety and privacy.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, this page will describe or provide links to the data practices for this website and any of the services that we offer.</p>\n<br>\n<br>Product-specific Policies<p>The following sections describe policies and practices specific to each of Gather\u2019s services.\nWe have two services: the \"Mapmaker\" (at https://gather.town/mapmaker) and the \"Gather App\" (all other parts of our website).</p>Gather App<p>Here are some of our data practices that we use for the Gather App:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We do NOT store or view any user video/audio.\nThey are encrypted in transit, not end-to-end, which is the same encryption policy taken by services like Google Meet</li>\n<li>By default, we store chat messages on our servers.\nThere is a space-wide option available to the host that allows them to turn this off and store all chats locally, though chat messages will no longer persist between sessions.</li>\n<li>We store any images or documents that you upload to Gather in build mode.\nThey are encrypted at rest in cloud storage.</li>\n<li>If you log into our site, we store your email address, when you created your account, and the last time you logged in.</li>\n<li>We keep store metadata about our spaces, including:<ul>\n<li>Which map that space was created with</li>\n<li>The unique URL for that space</li>\n<li>A salted hash of the space password, if there exists one</li>\n<li>Who created the space, and who are the moderators</li>\n<li>The list of emails and names in the guestlist, if any is set</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We store anonymized metrics, like how many users visit our site in total, or how many seconds are spent on video everyday.\nThis helps us understand the usage of the Gather App, which helps us what to prioritize.</li>\n<li>We store small bits of information that let us run our service, like the name you set in a room, whether or not you\u2019ve indicated that you\u2019re over 13, or what spaces you have access to.</li>\n<li>If you use our feedback form, we store your message, along with your name and email if you provide them.\nThis lets us read and respond to your feedback</li>\n<li>We use Google Analytics on all of our webpages.\nYou can learn more about how Google Analytics collects and processes your data on the following page: \u201cHow Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps.\u201d<ul>\n<li>We use Google Analytics to count and log the number of unique visitors on each page of our websites and to understand where that traffic is coming from.\nBoth of these help inform our writing and decision-making so we can provide this service to you..</li>\n<li>We only chose to use Google Analytics after reading through their privacy policy and deciding that it met our standards.\nIf this choice doesn\u2019t meet your standards, you can disable this feature on our websites below.\nIf you'd like to disable this feature across your web browser, Google provides an add-on that prevents your data from being used by Google Analytics on other websites.\nAs always, we also welcome you to tell us about your concerns.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>If you'd like to disable Google Analytics on \"gather.town\" and all its subdomains, just click here:DisableMapmaker<p>Here are some of our data practices that we use for the Mapmaker, specifically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We store everything you upload to mapmaker.\nThis includes background images and assets.\nEverything uploaded is encrypted at rest in cloud storage.</li>\n<li>We store metadata about the map, like what squares are impassable, where the spawn points are, and who owns what maps.</li>\n<li>We do not share maps with other users unless you explicitly share it yourself, invite them to a space with your map, or give us explicit consent.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p>We made these lists of practices in an effort to be informative beyond the typical legal requirements, so that you get a better picture of how your data is being used.\nIt might not be completely exhaustive.\nRefer to later sections in this document for a more general

\u2013 OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES<strong>Clause 8</strong>\n<em>\n<br>Data protection safeguards<br>\u200d</em>\n<strong>\u200d<br>\n</strong>The data exporter warrants that it has used reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able, through the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, to satisfy its obligations under these Clauses.<br>\n<br>8.1.\nInstructions<br>\n<br>(a) The data importer shall process the personal data only on documented instructions from the data exporter.\nThe data exporter may give such instructions throughout the duration of the contract.<br>\n<br>(b) The data importer shall immediately inform the data exporter if it is unable to follow those instructions.<br>\n<br>8.2.\nPurpose limitation<br>\n<br>The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B, unless on further instructions from the data exporter.<br>\n<br>8.3.\nTransparency<br>\n<br>On request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by the Parties, available to the data subject free of charge.\nTo the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including the measures described in Annex II and personal data, the data exporter may redact part of the text of the Appendix to these Clauses prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand the its content or exercise his/her rights.\nOn request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information.\nThis Clause is without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.<br>\n<br>8.4.\nAccuracy<br>\n<br>If the data importer becomes aware that the personal data it has received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the data exporter without undue delay.\nIn this case, the data importer shall cooperate with the data exporter to erase or rectify the data.<br>\n<br>8.5.\nDuration of processing and erasure or return of data<br>\n<br>Processing by the data importer shall only take place for the duration specified in Annex I.B.\nAfter the end of the provision of the processing services, the data importer shall, at the choice of the data exporter, delete all personal data processed on behalf of the data exporter and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, or return to the data exporter all personal data processed on its behalf and delete existing copies.\nUntil the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses.\nIn case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit return or deletion of the personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the extent and for as long as required under that local law.\nThis is without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement for the data importer under Clause 14(e) to notify the data exporter throughout the duration of the contract if it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under Clause 14(a).<br>\n<br>8.6.\nSecurity of processing<br>\n<br>(a) The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the data, including protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access to that data (hereinafter \u2018personal data breach\u2019).\nIn assessing the appropriate level of security, the Parties shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subjects.\nThe Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner.\nIn case of pseudonymisation, the additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject shall, where possible, remain under the exclusive control of the data exporter.\nIn complying with its obligations under this paragraph, the data importer shall at least implement the technical and organizational measures specified in Annex II.\nThe data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures

shall take appropriate measures to address the breach, including measures to mitigate its adverse effects.\nThe data importer shall also notify the data exporter without undue delay after having become aware of the breach.\nSuch notification shall contain the details of a contact point where more information can be obtained, a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.\nWhere, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide all information at the same time, the initial notification shall contain the information then available and further information shall, as it becomes available, subsequently be provided without undue delay.<br>\u200d<br>(d) The data importer shall cooperate with and assist the data exporter to enable the data exporter to comply with its obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular to notify the competent supervisory authority and the affected data subjects, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the data importer.<br>\n<br>8.7 Sensitive data<br>\n<br>Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person\u2019s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions and offences (hereinafter \u2018sensitive data\u2019), the data importer shall apply the specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards described in Annex I.B.<br>\n<br>8.8 Onward transfers<br>\n<br>The data importer shall only disclose the personal data to a third party on documented instructions from the data exporter.\nIn addition, the data may only be disclosed to a third party located outside the European Union (4) (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter \u2018onward transfer\u2019) if the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module, or if:<br>\n<br>(i) the onward transfer is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer;<br>(ii) the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 Regulation of (EU) 2016/679 with respect to the processing in question;<br>(iii) the onward transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings.\nor<br>(iv) the onward transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural

exporter.<br>\n<br>(c) The data importer shall make available to the data exporter all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out in these Clauses and at the data exporter\u2019s request, allow for and contribute to audits of the processing activities covered by these Clauses, at reasonable intervals or if there are indications of non-compliance.\nIn deciding on a review or audit, the data exporter may take into account relevant certifications held by the data importer.<br>\n<br>(d) The data exporter may choose to conduct the audit by itself or mandate an independent auditor.\nAudits may include inspections at the premises or physical facilities of the data importer and shall, where appropriate, be carried out with reasonable notice.<br>\n<br>(e) The Parties shall make the information referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c), including the results of any audits, available to the competent supervisory authority on

for the engagement of Sub- processor(s) from an agreed list.\nThe data importer shall specifically inform the data exporter in writing of any intended changes to that list through the addition or replacement of Sub- processors at least thirty (30) days in advance, thereby giving the data exporter sufficient time to be able to object to such changes prior to the engagement of the Sub-processor(s).\nThe data importer shall provide the data exporter with the information necessary to enable the data exporter to exercise its right to object.<br>\n<br>(b) Where the data importer engages a Sub-processor to carry out specific processing activities (on behalf of the data exporter), it shall do so by way of a written contract that provides for, in substance, the same data protection obligations as those binding the data importer under these Clauses, including in terms of third-party beneficiary rights for data subjects.\n(8) The Parties agree that, by complying with this Clause, the data importer fulfils its obligations under Clause <br>\n<br>8.8.\nThe data importer shall ensure that the Sub-processor complies with the obligations to which the data importer is subject pursuant to these Clauses.<br>\n<br>(c) The data importer shall provide, at the data exporter\u2019s request, a copy of such a Sub-processor agreement and any subsequent amendments to the data exporter.\nTo the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the data importer may redact the text of the agreement prior to sharing a copy.<br>\n<br>(d) The data importer shall remain fully responsible to the data exporter for the performance of the Sub-processor\u2019s obligations under its contract with the data importer.\nThe data importer shall notify the data exporter of any failure by the Sub-processor to fulfill its obligations under that contract.<br>\n<br>(e) The data importer shall agree a third-party beneficiary clause with the Sub-processor whereby \u2013 in the event the data importer has factually disappeared, ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent \u2013 the data exporter shall have the right to terminate the Sub-processor contract and to instruct the Sub-processor to erase or return the personal data.<br>\u200d<br>\n<strong>Clause 10</strong>\n<em>\n<br>Data subject rights<br>\u200d</em>\n<strong>\u200d<br>\n</strong>(a) The data importer shall promptly notify the data exporter of any request it has received from a data subject.\nIt shall not respond to that request itself unless it has been authorised to do so by the data exporter.<br>\n<br>(b) The data importer shall assist the data exporter in fulfilling its obligations to respond to data subjects\u2019 requests for the exercise of their rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.\nIn this regard, the Parties shall set out in Annex II the appropriate technical and organisational measures, taking into account the nature of the processing, by which the assistance shall be provided, as well as the scope and the extent of the assistance required.<br>\n<br>(c) In fulfilling its obligations under paragraphs (a) and (b), the data importer shall comply with the instructions from the data exporter.<br>\u200d<br>\n<strong>Clause 11</strong>\n<em>\n<br>Redress<br>\u200d</em>\n<strong>\u200d<br>\n</strong>(a) The data importer shall inform data subjects in a transparent and easily accessible format, through individual notice or on its website, of a contact point authorised to handle complaints.\nIt shall deal promptly with any complaints it receives from a data subject.<br>\n<br>(b) In case of a dispute between a data subject and one of the Parties as regards compliance with these Clauses, that Party shall use its best efforts to resolve the issue amicably in a timely fashion.\nThe Parties shall keep each other informed about such disputes and, where appropriate, cooperate in resolving them.<br>\n<br>(c) Where the data subject invokes a third-party beneficiary right pursuant to Clause 3, the data importer

supervisory authority pursuant to Clause 13;<br>(ii) refer the dispute to the competent courts within the meaning of Clause 18.<br>\n<br>(d) The Parties accept that the data subject may be represented by a not-for-profit body, organisation or association under the conditions set out in Article 80(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.<br>\n<br>(e) The data importer shall abide by a decision that is binding under the applicable EU or Member State law.<br>\n<br>(f) The data importer agrees that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice his/her substantive and procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with applicable laws.<br>\u200d<br>\n<strong>Clause 12</strong>\n<em>\n<br>Liability<br>\u200d</em>\n<strong>\u200d<br>\n</strong>(a) Each Party shall be liable to the other

non-material damages the data exporter or the data importer (or its Sub-processor) causes the data subject by breaching the third-party beneficiary rights under these Clauses.\nThis is without prejudice to the liability of the data exporter and, where the data exporter is a processor acting on behalf of a controller, to the liability of the controller under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, as applicable.<br>\n<br>(d) The Parties agree that if the data exporter is held liable under paragraph (c) for damages caused by the data importer (or its Sub-processor), it

14</strong>\n<em>\n<br>Local laws and practices affecting compliance with the Clauses<br>\u200d</em>\n<strong>\u200d<br>\n</strong>(a) The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data importer, including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses.\nThis is based on the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.<br>\n<br>(b) The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following elements:<br>\n<br>(i) the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used.\nintended onward transfers.\nthe type of recipient.\nthe purpose of processing.\nthe categories and format of the transferred personal data.\nthe economic sector in which the transfer occurs.\nthe storage location of the data transferred;<br>\n<br>(ii) the laws and practices of the third country of destination\u2013 including those requiring the disclosure of data to public authorities or authorising access by

organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the country of destination.<br>\n<br>(c) The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to provide the data exporter with relevant information and agrees that it will continue to cooperate with the data exporter in ensuring compliance with these Clauses.<br>\n<br>(d) The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.<br>\n<br>(e) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a).<br>\n<br>(f) Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g.\ntechnical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or data importer to address the situation.\nThe data exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by the competent supervisory authority to do so.\nIn this case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses.\nIf the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise.\nWhere the contract is terminated pursuant to this Clause, Clause 16(d) and (e) shall apply.<br>\u200d<br>\n<strong>Clause 15</strong>\n<em>\n<br>Obligations of the data importer in case of access by public

exporter and/or the data subject under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with a view to communicating as much information as possible, as soon as possible.\nThe data importer agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them on request of the data exporter.<br>\n<br>(c) Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to provide the data exporter, at regular intervals for the duration of the contract, with as much relevant information as possible on the requests received (in particular, number of requests, type of data requested, requesting authority/ies, whether requests have been challenged and the outcome of such challenges, etc.).<br>\n<br>(d) The data importer agrees to preserve the information pursuant to paragraphs <br>\n<br>(a) to (c) for the duration of the contract and make it available to the competent

disclosure, in particular whether it remains within the powers granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of the country of destination, applicable obligations under international law and principles of international comity.\nThe data importer shall, under the same conditions, pursue possibilities of appeal.\nWhen challenging a request, the data importer shall seek interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until the competent judicial authority has decided on its merits.\nIt shall not disclose the personal data requested until required to do so under the applicable procedural rules.\nThese requirements are without prejudice to the obligations of the data importer under Clause 14(e).<br>\n<br>(b) The data importer agrees to document its legal assessment and any challenge to the request for disclosure and, to the extent permissible under the laws of the country of destination, make the documentation available to the data exporter.\nIt shall also make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.<br>\n<br>(c) The data importer agrees to provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to a request for disclosure, based on a reasonable

whatever reason.<br>\n<br>(b) In the event that the data importer is in breach of these Clauses or unable to comply with these Clauses, the data exporter shall suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until compliance is again ensured or the contract is terminated.\nThis is without prejudice to Clause 14(f).<br>\n<br>(c) The data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses, where:<br>\n<br>(i) the data exporter has suspended the transfer of personal data to the data importer pursuant to paragraph (b) and compliance with these Clauses is not restored within a reasonable time and in any event within one month of suspension;<br>\n<br>(ii) the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of these Clauses.\nor<br>\n<br>(iii) the data importer fails to comply with a binding decision of a competent court or supervisory authority regarding its obligations under these Clauses.<br>\n<br>In these cases, it shall inform the competent supervisory authority of such non-compliance.\nWhere the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise.<br>\n<br>(d) Personal data that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant to paragraph (c) shall at the choice of the data exporter immediately be returned to the data exporter or deleted in its entirety.\nThe same shall apply to any copies of the data.] The data importer shall certify the deletion of the data to the data exporter.\nUntil the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses.\nIn case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit the return or deletion of the transferred personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process the data to the extent and for as long as required under that local law.<br>\n<br>(e) Either Party may revoke its agreement to be bound by these Clauses where (i) the European Commission adopts a decision pursuant to Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the transfer of personal data to which these Clauses apply.\nor (ii) Regulation (EU) 2016/679
