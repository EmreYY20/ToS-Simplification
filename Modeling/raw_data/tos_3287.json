applies to the Sites and Services only.\nWhen you visit websites to which we link, or if you click on third party advertisements that appear on our Sites, you will be interacting with a third party that operates under its own privacy and security policies.\nFor example, a third party website will have its own policy regarding the use of cookies and web beacons or collection of your

applications may result in these third parties collecting your personal information and obtaining information from NetZero, including location information (when applicable).\nYou may also choose to give personal information directly to third parties when using such services.\nIn each case, personal information you give a third party will be subject to its terms, conditions, and policies-not this policy.\nYou should review a third party's privacy policy and terms of service before providing your information or using the service.\nWe encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other website or application from which you request products or services.\nYou can access and update most of your basic account information by visiting your account page.\nBecause your privacy is important

simply decline to participate when asked, but we would like your feedback in order to improve our Sites and Services.\nIf a privacy data request is made, we will be unable to display the specific data you provide to the third party, but can share any partners we have worked with in the prior 12 month period.\n<br>\n<br>\nPlease see Section II of this Policy to see how we use, share and disclose

elected to be remembered, and they may also measure whether you've seen or interacted with an advertisement on our Sites or other sites.\nCookies (or similar technological methods) also allow us, our Affiliates and our third party partners to serve you with advertisements including targeted advertisements when you are on or off the Sites.\nCookies may be set on your browser when you visit our Sites, or when you open emails from us.\n<br>\n<br>\nWeb beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and may be used to track the online movement of users.\nWeb beacons help us and our third party partners better manage content delivery by informing us when you are on our Sites and what content is effective.\nWe also use web beacons in our emails to let us know which emails you have opened.\n<br>\n<br>\nNetZero does not currently take action as to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not been developed.\n<br>\n<br>\nPlease see Sections II and III of this Policy to see how we use, share and disclose information collected through technological methods.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>E.\nRetention of Information:</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nNetZero

&amp.\nOpt-Outs</p>\n<b>A.\nTargeted Advertising Opt-Outs:</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nWe may display targeted advertisements to you while you are on and off our Sites based on information we obtain from you, about you, and/or from third parties.\n<br>\n<br> We work with advertisers, agencies, and other companies that connect advertisers to the Internet (collectively, \"<b>Advertisers</b>\") in order to display targeted advertisements to you while you are on and off our Sites.\nThese advertisements are targeted based on information that we or third parties may have collected about you such as demographic information (gender, age, general geographic location, etc.) as well as behavioral information.\nBehavioral information is information about your preferences that is collected or inferred based on, among other things, online data such as the URLs or websites you visit and searches you perform, and offline data such as your purchases and subscriptions.\nInformation shared with Advertisers is pseudonymized prior to transfer.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe and our Advertisers may use technological methods to measure the effectiveness of advertisements and to personalize advertising content.\nfor example, web beacons may enable us or our Advertisers to recognize your browser when you visit our Sites or when you open an email.\nIn addition, a unique third party cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser when you visit our Sites or when you open an email.\n<br>\n<br>\nYou may opt out of targeted advertising from many Advertisers by exercising your choice here.\nPlease note that although you may opt out of targeted advertising, you may continue to see advertisements.\nthese advertisements may not, however, be as relevant to you as targeted advertisements.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf you choose to opt out of receiving targeted advertising, please note that the opt-out tools accessed here are specific to the browser and computer, mobile device or other similar device you are using at the time you opt out.\nYour opt-out choice cannot be honored if you access our Sites using a different browser on this computer, mobile device or other similar device, or if you access our Sites from a different device.\nAlso, since the opt-out tools involve placing a special cookie on your browser, your opt-out choice cannot be honored if all cookies on your device(s) are deleted.\nAs a result, you should repeat this opt-out process with each browser and device you use to access the Sites and Services and whenever cookies are deleted from your device(s).\nNetZero has no control over any opt-out tool offered by others and cannot guarantee the performance of such tools.\n<br>\n<br>\nInstead of using the cookie-based opt-out tools described above, you may also choose to not allow cookies to be stored on your computer, mobile device, or other similar device by modifying your web browser settings.\nEach browser is different, so make sure to check each browser's user guide to learn how to change your cookie preferences for each browser.\nIf you choose to reject cookies, however, you may not be able to automatically access products and services offered by us that require a user \"login\" or \"sign in.\" In addition, any cookie-based opt-out tools may not be implemented on your device.\n<br>\n<br>\nPlease see Section I.D.\nof this Policy for more information on technological methods of data collection such as cookies and web beacons.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>B.\nEmail Opt-Outs:</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nYou may receive email advertisements and promotions from us, our Affiliates and our Advertisers regarding products or services we believe you may be interested in, new features or products we are introducing, or other promotions.\nIf you decide that you wish to cease receiving such email, you may do so at any time by following the opt-out instructions in the email.\n<br>\n<br>\nSince it is necessary for us to contact you regarding certain matters, you may not opt out of receiving messages related to material company announcements or policy changes, or administrative matters relating to your account, like billing, collections, customer service or similar matters.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf you subscribe to a free or discounted version of a Service, you acknowledge that as a condition of receiving such free or discounted Service, you are required to receive information and advertising solicitations from third party Advertisers.\nYou may opt out of receiving individual communications from each Advertiser by following the instructions provided by the Advertiser.\nThese solicitations are a condition of receiving the free or discounted Service and you agree that if you opt out of receiving these solicitations you are required to terminate the relevant Service.\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>IV.\nHow We Keep Your Information Secure</p> We use secure socket layer (\"<b>SSL</b>\") technology to protection your information.\nSSL encrypts your order information as additional protection against the decoding of that information by anyone other than us.\nHowever, despite all reasonable security precautions and processes, such as password protection, encryption technology, and use of firewall technology, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.\nAs a result, while we strive to protect all information we collect and process, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our Sites, and you do so at your own risk.\nOnce we receive your transmission, we will take commercially reasonable precautions to protect its security on our systems.\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>V.\nMinors' Use of the Services</p>\nNetZero believes it is important for parents

unless the pricing terms for the applicable NetZero Service expressly says otherwise.\nNetZero may provide a thirty (30) day money back guarantee for its DSL Service (see your service plan description).\nIf your DSL plan includes a money-back guarantee, your thirty (30) day money-back guarantee begins upon the date NetZero begins billing you for the DSL service.\nDuring this thirty (30) day period you may cancel the DSL service and receive a full refund of the monthly charge you have actually paid to NetZero as well as any activation charges paid to NetZero.\nprovided, however, in order to receive your refund you must return all Equipment to NetZero in good working condition within thirty (30) days of termination.\nNetZero will provide you with a pre-paid mailing label and instructions for the return of your Equipment.\nIn the event you fail to return the Equipment within thirty (30) days, you will be unable to receive your refund.\nEarly termination fees will not apply to DSL service terminated within the thirty (30) day money-back guarantee period.\nThe thirty (30) day money-back guarantee does not apply to customers who change between monthly, annual, bundled or other DSL service pricing plans and does not apply to registrations with free introductory periods.\nThe money-back guarantee is limited to one per subscriber per address.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>NetZero TurboStream\u2122</b>\n<br>\nSubject to any applicable law, fees and charges for NetZero Services are non-refundable unless the pricing terms for the applicable NetZero Service expressly says

before the installation date.\nA person at least 18 years of age must be present at your premise to meet the installation contractor on the agreed upon date and time.\nFailure to do so will result in a non-refundable missed appointment fee of one hundred dollars ($100).\nProfessional installation includes configuring the NetZero TurboStream\u2122 modem for service.\nIf necessary, the technician may perform up to one hour of inside wiring work, including the installation of a new jack or new wiring for any Services.\nNetZero does not warranty any inside wiring work and engages independent contractors to perform such work.\nYou agree that any such technician or other person dispatched to troubleshoot your line is not an employee or agent of NetZero and NetZero is not liable for any damages, costs or expenses relating to or arising from any acts, errors or omissions by any such technician or other person.\nYou will be required to sign or confirm an agreement with any technician.\nNetZero TurboStream\u2122 is subject to a 12 month commitment that commences when installation is complete.\nCancellation of service within 30 days of installation is not subject to any early termination fees.\nCancellation after 30 days of service will result in an early termination fee of up to $350 depending on the service plan chosen and how many months of service are remaining in your commitment period.\nUse of equipment supplied by NetZero TurboStream\u2122 is required.\nNetZero TurboStream\u2122 will provide the equipment, and a monthly rental fee will be charged.\nIf we determine that the provided equipment is not functioning correctly, replacement equipment will be provided at no additional cost to you.\nBilling for the first month of your NetZero TurboStream\u2122 service will start on the date of activation rather than the date of purchase.\n<br>\n<br>\nYou must provide a valid method of payment (i.e.\nPIN code, credit card, checking account, etc., depending on the type of NetZero Service) prior to and during any times you receive billable NetZero Services.\nFor continuous service plans with recurring payments, you are responsible for keeping all of your billing information, including your payment method, up to date.\nYou expressly authorize NetZero (or third parties acting on behalf of NetZero) to charge all NetZero subscription fees and other charges, including payment transaction fees for certain payment methods, to the payment method you have designated.\nYou acknowledge and agree that NetZero will not obtain any additional authorization from you for any recurring payments or automatic billing options.\nIf you have any billing-related questions or want to stop a recurring payment from being charged to your designated payment method, call our toll-free billing support number (1-800-638-9376).\nSome fees that you may incur using the NetZero Services may accumulate on your NetZero account before they are charged to your designated payment method.\nSet up fees, activation fees, installation fees, other non-recurring fees, and Equipment charges, if applicable, will be included in your first month's bill.\nNetZero will assess a late fee of 1.5% per month (or the highest amount permissible by law, whichever is less) if your payment is more than thirty (30) days past due.\nYou will be liable for any fees NetZero incurs in its efforts to collect any unpaid balances from you.\nANY BILLING PROBLEMS OR DISCREPANCIES MUST BE BROUGHT TO NETZERO'S ATTENTION BY YOU WITHIN ONE HUNDRED (100) DAYS FROM THE DATE YOU ARE BILLED.\nIF YOU DO NOT BRING THEM TO NETZERO'S ATTENTION WITHIN ONE HUNDRED (100) DAYS, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO DISPUTE SUCH PROBLEMS OR DISCREPANCIES WITH NETZERO.\nNetZero may suspend or terminate your use of the NetZero Services if you fail to provide a valid designated payment method upon request, or if NetZero is unable for any reason to bill charges to your designated payment method.\n<br>\n<br>\nFor monthly subscribers on continuous plans with recurring payments, your NetZero Service will typically be billed on the same day each month based on the date you register for your service, unless you are notified otherwise by NetZero.\nFor example, if you register for service on the 15th of the month, you will be billed on (or shortly after) the 15th each subsequent month for service.\nNote that if you register on the 29th, 30th, or 31st of the month, your billing date will be the 1st of the month.\nFor multi-month subscribers (i.e.\nannual and semi-annual), your NetZero Service will be billed on the same day of the month at the prescribed renewal period.\nBilling for your dial-up or VPN NetZero Service will automatically begin upon registration of your service.\nBilling for the first month of your NetZero DSL service (excluding NetZero TurboStream\u2122) may be prorated based on the date provisioning of your service is complete and ready for use (\"<b>Service Ready Date</b>\").\nPlease note that the Service Ready Date is not determined by the date you install and/or initially use the DSL service (excluding NetZero TurboStream\u2122), but rather the date such service is provided to your location by NetZero's service provider.\nWhen you purchase your NetZero Wireless Services Equipment directly from NetZero, billing for the first month of your Wireless Service will be prorated based on the estimated arrival of your Wireless Services Equipment.\nPlease note that the first month's prorated bill (excluding NetZero TurboStream\u2122) is not determined by the date you install and/or initially use the Wireless Service, but rather the date Equipment is expected to arrive.\nIf you are an existing NetZero pay customer and you sign up for a new NetZero Service with a recurring payment, the term and fee for the first period of your new NetZero Service will be pro-rated to coincide with your current billing cycle.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf you are purchasing a VPN, dial-up or DSL Internet access service plan, at the end of any free or discounted period, if applicable, and at the end of each plan term, you will be automatically renewed into and charged for the same plan at the then current price unless you select a different plan or cancel your service.\nIf you are purchasing a Wireless Services continuous service plan with recurring payments, (i) access to the free service for mobile broadband, if available in your area, terminates on the date specified when you initially signed up for this free service and may not be renewed, and (ii) at the end of any discounted period, if applicable, and at the end of each plan term, you will be automatically renewed into and charged for the same plan at the then current price unless you select a different plan or cancel your service.\n<br>\n<br>\nYou are responsible for all fees and charges incurred, including applicable taxes and purchases made by you or anyone you allow to use your account, including your children and other members of your family.\nThis means that, unless your account or payment method information is obtained unlawfully or fraudulently by someone other than those authorized to use your account, you will be responsible for all usage and purchases under your account.\n<br>\n<br>\nYOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL AMOUNTS CHARGED BY NETZERO AND BY YOUR TELEPHONE SERVICE PROVIDER FOR ALL CALLS YOU MAKE, INCLUDING CALLS TO NETZERO'S CUSTOMER SUPPORT LINES.\nCHECK WITH YOUR LOCAL TELEPHONE SERVICE PROVIDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE ACCESS TELEPHONE NUMBERS YOU USE TO ACCESS THE NETZERO SERVICES ARE PROVIDED AT NO CHARGE BY YOUR TELEPHONE SERVICE PROVIDER.\nFOR DIAL-UP SERVICE, BY ACCEPTING THE ACCESS NUMBERS DURING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS OR USING ACCESS NUMBERS YOU MAY OTHERWISE SELECT, YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL TELEPHONE CHARGES RELATED TO ACCESSING OUR SERVICES, AND NETZERO WILL NOT REIMBURSE YOU FOR ANY SUCH CHARGES INCLUDING LONG DISTANCE OR TOLL CHARGES.\nUNLESS YOUR PLAN PROVIDES OTHERWISE, YOU WILL BE CHARGED A FEE FOR CALLS TO NETZERO TECHNICAL SUPPORT.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf your NetZero Service plan is time-metered (meaning that you have a set number of hours during which you may utilize the service each month), you will be responsible for paying any per minute charges imposed by NetZero for exceeding your monthly allotment of hours.\nUse of the NetZero Service for time-metered plans is measured in minutes and is rounded up to the next whole minute.\n<br>\n<br>\nYou may obtain pricing information for supplemental services or features, as well as answers to common billing questions by going to the NetZero Site.\n<br>\n<br>\nUnder your Wireless Services plan, your data usage will be deducted from your plan's available data allocation.\nUnused data expire at the end of each monthly billing cycle or such other time period as specified in your plan (e.g., after thirty (30) days from date of PIN code activation).\nIf you are on a continuous service plan and you use your allocation of data before the end of the data expiration date, you may (i) purchase an additional data allocation through our top-up service to continue using the Wireless Services during the current billing cycle (top-up data allocations are good for thirty (30) days from date of purchase), (ii) upgrade your plan, or (iii) wait until the beginning of the next billing cycle to have access to the Wireless Service.\nIf you are on a PIN activated service plan and you use your allocation of data before the end of the data expiration date, you may purchase an additional data allocation with a valid credit card or with a new PIN code through our top-up service (top-up data allocations are good for thirty (30) days from date of PIN code activation).\nUnder the mobile broadband free service plan, if available in your area, you will be allocated a certain amount of data usage per month with your purchase of Equipment (see your plan description for more information).\nYour right to access to this free service terminates on the date specified when you initially signed up for this free service and may not be renewed.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Minors.\n</b> You may not obtain an account for pay NetZero Services unless you are at least 18 years old, and you represent that you are

EVENT THAT YOU TERMINATE (OR TAKE AN ACTION THAT CAUSES TERMINATION OF) YOUR NETZERO SERVICE BEFORE SATISFYING THE MINIMUM TERM COMMITMENT UNDER YOUR PLAN, THEN YOU AGREE TO PAY NETZERO UPON DISCONTINUANCE OF THE SERVICE A TERMINATION FEE AS SET FORTH IN YOUR PLAN DESCRIPTION (THE \"<b>EARLY TERMINATION FEE</b>\").\nIn addition to any applicable Early Termination Fee, you will be required to pay the remaining balance of the charges applicable to your NetZero Service through the effective date of termination.\nActivation, set-up or pre-paid service fees paid at the initiation of your NetZero Service, if any, are not refundable.\nIf you terminate DSL service at your location, your existing plan may not be carried over to a new location.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Termination and/or Suspension by NetZero.\n</b> NetZero may terminate the NetZero Services upon thirty (30) days' notice to you for any reason.\nAdditionally, if, in the sole discretion of NetZero: (a) you are in breach of any of the Rules, including, but not limited to, the Acceptable Use Guidelines.\n(b) your use of the NetZero Services is prohibited by law or is disruptive to, adversely impacts, or causes a malfunction to the NetZero Services or the use and enjoyment of other users.\n(c) NetZero receives an order from a court to terminate your service.\n(d) if NetZero for any reason ceases to offer a NetZero Service entirely or in a particular geographic area or specific location.\nor (e) if you no longer live in an area where NetZero provides the NetZero Service for which you subscribed, then NetZero at its sole election may terminate or suspend your NetZero Service immediately without notice.\nFor termination in accordance with this Section, you shall be liable for the applicable fees and/or Equipment charges set forth in previous paragraphs (depending on which fees or charges are applicable).\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Events That Could Cause Termination of Your DSL Service.\n</b> If you are purchasing a fixed line DSL service (i.e., non-satellite DSL service), your DSL service is tied to the broadband connection into your house or building.\nAs such, certain actions you take that impact your broadband connection could result in the termination of your DSL service.\nSuch actions include, but are not limited to, changing your telephone service provider, changing your telephone number, or ordering a service that impacts or changes your underlying broadband connection (such as ordering cable television service from a telephone company).\nANY SUCH TERMINATION WILL BE TREATED AS TERMINATION OF YOUR DSL SERVICE BY YOU AND MAY RESULT IN AN EARLY TERMINATION FEE.\nADDITIONALLY, YOUR DSL SERVICE IS NOT PORTABLE.\nSHOULD YOU MOVE, YOU WILL NEED TO CANCEL YOUR DSL SERVICE (WHICH MAY RESULT IN AN EARLY TERMINATION FEE) AND REORDER IT.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Regulatory Compliance.\n</b> In the event there is a ruling, regulation, or order issued by a judicial, legislative or regulatory body that causes NetZero to believe that the Rules may be in conflict with such rules, regulations, and orders, NetZero may terminate or modify the NetZero Services and/or the Rules immediately without notice.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>4.0 Warranty Disclaimers</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Services.\n</b> YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NETZERO SERVICES ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS,

qualify for NetZero Services even if initial testing showed that your line was qualified.\nNetZero or its suppliers may, at any time, without notice or liability, restrict the use of NetZero Services or limit their time of availability in order to perform maintenance activities and to maintain session control.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Equipment.\n</b>NetZero will not accept returns/exchanges for Equipment not purchased directly from NetZero, including purchases from authorized NetZero retailers.\nIf you purchased your Equipment directly from NetZero, your Equipment is covered by a limited

PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS BE LIABLE UNDER ANY SECTION OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE OR UNDER CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF USE, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR INFORMATION OF ANY KIND OR LOSS OF BUSINESS GOODWILL OR OPPORTUNITY) WHETHER

FORM, ARISING OUT OF THE RULES OR OUT OF THE NETZERO SERVICES MAY BE BROUGHT BY YOU OR NETZERO MORE THAN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE EVENT WHICH GAVE RISE TO THE CAUSE OF ACTION HAS OCCURRED.\nSome jurisdictions do not allow a limitation on liability for negligence that causes death or personal injury and, in such jurisdictions, NetZero's liability shall be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.\n<p>6.0 Policy to Terminate Use of Services for Copyright Infringement</p> Pursuant to 17 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 512 as amended by Title II of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, NetZero will terminate your account if you use your account privileges to unlawfully transmit copyrighted material without a license, valid defense or fair use privilege to do so.\nAfter proper notification by the copyright holder or its agent to NetZero and later confirmation through court order or an admission by the subscriber that an account has been an instrument of unlawful infringement, NetZero will terminate your account.\nNetZero may also, in its sole discretion, decide to terminate your account privileges prior to that time if it has good faith belief that infringement has occurred.\nNetZero will also terminate your account if you are deemed to be a repeat infringer.\nA repeat infringer is a subscriber who has been notified of infringing activity more than twice and/or has had User Generated Content removed from the NetZero Site or NetZero Services more than twice.\nIn addition, pursuant to 17 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 512(c), NetZero has implemented procedures as set forth

by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\nand</li>\n<li>A statement that the information in your notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>\n</ol>\nAny notification by a copyright owner or a person authorized to act on its behalf that fails to comply with the provisions above shall not be considered sufficient notice and shall not be deemed to confer upon NetZero actual knowledge of facts or circumstances from which infringing material or acts are evident.\n<p>7.0

have a dispute.\n<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Providing Notice of a Claim.\n</b>\n<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>You and NetZero agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us (\"<b>Disputes or Claims</b>\").\nThis agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.\nIt includes, but is not limited to: <br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Disputes or Claims related in any way to a NetZero Service, Equipment, the Rules, billing, privacy, advertising, or NetZero's communications with you.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Disputes or Claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Disputes or Claims that arose before your agreement to these Terms of Services or any prior agreement.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Disputes or Claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class.\nand <br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Disputes or Claims that may arise after the termination of your NetZero Service.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (\"<b>Notice</b>\").\nNotice to NetZero must be sent to NetZero's customer service address at: NetZero Dispute Resolution, United Online Inc., PO BOX 7064, Woodland Hills, CA 91365.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>The Notice must include (a) the nature and basis of your Dispute or Claim.\n(b) identification or enclosure of all relevant documents and information.\nand (c) a description of the specific relief that you seek from NetZero.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Providing NetZero an Opportunity to Informally Resolve Your Dispute.</b>\n<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Before you may pursue or participate in any Dispute or Claim (or raise such Dispute or Claim as a defense) in small claims court or in arbitration against NetZero, you must first send the Notice described above, and you must allow NetZero a reasonable opportunity to resolve your Dispute or Claim.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>After NetZero receives your Notice, you and NetZero agree to negotiate in good faith with each other to try to resolve your Dispute or Claim.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>If you and NetZero do not reach a resolution of your Dispute or Claim within thirty (30) days after NetZero receives your written Notice, you may pursue your Dispute or Claim in arbitration or, solely to the extent specifically provided below, in small claims court.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Agreement to Participate in Binding Arbitration.</b>\n<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>If you and NetZero cannot reach an informal resolution to the Dispute or Claim within thirty (30) days after NetZero's receipt of your Notice, you or NetZero may commence an arbitration proceeding by sending an arbitration demand (\"<b>Arbitration Demand</b>\") to the following address: NetZero Dispute Resolution, United Online Inc., PO BOX 7064, Woodland Hills, CA 91365.\nThe parties agree to arbitrate any Dispute or Claim between the parties, except to the extent either party chooses to instead pursue the Dispute or Claim in small claims court as provided below.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Except as otherwise provided herein, upon you or NetZero filing an Arbitration Demand, NetZero will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees, unless your Dispute or Claim exceeds $75,000 (exclusive of any filing, administration, arbitrator, or attorneys' fees or other fees or expenses).\nIf you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 (exclusive of any filing, administration, arbitrator, or attorneys' fees or other fees or expenses) in damages, the American Arbitration Association's (\"<b>AAA</b>\") Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the \"<b>AAA Rules</b>\") will govern the payment of these fees.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>The AAA Rules, as modified by these Terms of Service, will govern the arbitration.\nThe AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>If your Dispute or Claim is for $10,000 or less (exclusive of any filing, administration, arbitrator, or attorneys' fees or other fees or expenses), NetZero agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the AAA Rules.\nIf your Dispute or Claim exceeds $10,000 (exclusive of any filing, administration, arbitrator, or attorneys' fees or other fees or expenses), the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Unless NetZero and you agree otherwise in writing, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) in which your most recent billing address (as provided to NetZero) is located.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>One arbitrator, who is selected under the AAA Rules and who has expertise in consumer disputes in the wireless industry, will conduct the arbitration.\nIf no arbitrator possessing such expertise is available, then the arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator who is selected by the mutual written approval of you and NetZero.\nExcept as allowed under applicable law and the AAA Rules, the decisions of the arbitrator will be binding and conclusive on all parties.\nJudgment upon any award of the arbitrator may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.\nThis provision will be specifically enforceable in any court.\nTHE ARBITRATOR MUST FOLLOW THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS' FEES).\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Except as otherwise provided herein, NetZero will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above.\nIf, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your Dispute or Claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\nAlso, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>NetZero may make a written settlement offer to you before the arbitrator issues an award.\nIf, after the arbitrator finds in your favor on the merits of the claim, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than NetZero's written offer, NetZero will: (a) pay you the greater of the amount of the award or $7,500 (\"<b>Alternative Payment</b>\").\nand (b) pay your attorney, if you use an attorney, twice the amount of any reasonable attorneys' fees awarded by the arbitrator, and reimburse any expenses that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your arbitration claim (\"<b>Attorney Fee Premium</b>\").\nThe Attorney Fee Premium does not supplant any right you may have to reasonable attorneys' fees under applicable law.\nThus, if you would be entitled to a greater amount under applicable law, the Attorney Fee Premium does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount.\nYou may not, however, recover duplicative attorneys' fees or costs.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>If NetZero does not make a written settlement offer to you before the arbitrator issues an award, you and your attorney will be entitled to the Alternative Payment and the Attorney Fee Premium, respectively, if the arbitrator decides in your favor on the merits.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>NetZero agrees that it will not seek any award of attorneys' fees, even if it is entitled to such fees.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>The arbitrator may make any determinations and resolve any Dispute or Claim as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, the Alternative Payment, or the Attorney Fee Premium at any time during the proceeding and within fourteen (14) days after the arbitrator's final ruling on the merits.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>YOU AND NETZERO AGREE THAT: <br>\n<br>\n</b>\n<ul>\n<b>\n<li>ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nNEITHER YOU NOR NETZERO SHALL BE A MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING, AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL DISPUTE OR CLAIM.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>UNLESS BOTH PARTIES AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S DISPUTES OR CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n</b>\n<li>\n<b>NETZERO DOES NOT CONSENT TO CLASS ARBITRATION.\nACCORDINGLY, IF A COURT REFUSES TO ENFORCE THE ABOVE PROVISIONS REGARDING CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS, THEN THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL BE UNENFORCEABLE AS TO YOU.\nWHETHER A DISPUTE OR CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION, YOU AND NETZERO HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.\n</b>\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This arbitration agreement covers any Dispute or Claim arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and NetZero, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, even if the Dispute or Claim arises or may arise before or after the period(s) during which you are receiving NetZero Services.\nFor purposes of this arbitration provision, references to \"<b>NetZero</b>,\" \"<b>we</b>,\" and \"<b>us</b>\" include NetZero, NetZero's Affiliates, and each such entity's respective the directors, officers, employees, shareholders, agents, suppliers, and assignees.\nThe Rules evidence a transaction in interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this section.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>You or NetZero must bring any Dispute or Claim arising out of or related to the Rules, or the relationship between you and NetZero, within two (2) years after the Dispute or Claim arises, or the Dispute or Claim will be permanently barred.\nTo the extent the law applicable under the Governing Law section below makes this limitations period unenforceable with respect to any Dispute(s) or Claim(s), then the statutes of limitations of the state whose laws govern the Rules under the Governing Law section below shall apply.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>NetZero may make changes to this arbitration provision during the term of our services to you.\nYou may reject any material changes by sending NetZero written objection within thirty (30) days of the change to NetZero Dispute Resolution, United Online, Inc., PO Box 7064, Woodland Hills, CA 91365, Attention Legal Department.\nBy rejecting any future material change, you are agreeing to arbitrate in accordance with the language of this provision.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Small Claims Court.\n</b> You may choose to pursue your Dispute or Claim in small claims court rather than by arbitration if your Dispute or Claim qualifies for small claims court in a location where jurisdiction and venue over you and NetZero is proper.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Governing Law.\n</b> The Rules, and any Dispute or Claim arising between you and NetZero related in any way to the Rules, NetZero Services, or Equipment, including but not limited to any Dispute or Claim over billing, service, privacy, advertising, or NetZero's communications with you, whether based on contract, tort, statute, or common law, will be governed by the laws of the state in which your most recent billing address (as provided to NetZero) is located, without regard to choice of law principles.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>9.0 Miscellaneous</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Liability Limitation.\n</b> NetZero shall not be liable for nonperformance or delay in performance caused by any reason, whether within or outside of its control.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Fair Access for Satellite Service.\n</b> NetZero's satellite Internet access service provider may assign a download threshold to each satellite Internet access service plan in order to limit the amount of data that may be continuously downloaded.\nThe small percentage of subscribers who exceed this limit will experience a temporary reduction of speed in their satellite Internet access.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Subpoenas.\n</b> NetZero may be required to provide information about you to a third party.\nExcept as prohibited by law, we will comply with law enforcement or government agencies and civil subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process (including civil and criminal) or otherwise as required by law.\nWe may notify you if we plan to comply with a civil subpoena, court order or other legal process related to your NetZero Service.\nYou agree to hold us harmless for the release of your information in connection with responding to subpoenas, court order and other legal process including, but not limited to, any claims that you did not receive notice of the subpoena from NetZero.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Electronic Agreements.\n</b> Any registrations, agreements, and terms presented by NetZero electronically have the same effect as one in writing and are legally enforceable as a signed writing.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Assignability.</b> NetZero may assign these Terms of Service at any time without notice to you.\nYou may not assign these Terms of Service to any other person.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Entire Agreement.\n</b> The Rules (as may be modified by updated Rules on the NetZero Site) and your plan description together constitute the sole agreement between NetZero and you respecting the subject matter hereof.\nTo the extent that the Rules conflict with the provisions of any other agreement between you and NetZero, then the Rules shall control, unless NetZero has expressly stated or agreed otherwise in writing, and the conflicting provisions of the other agreement shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to be read consistently with the Rules.\nYou acknowledge and agree that you have read the Rules and understand and accept their terms.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Severability.\n</b> If any provision of the Rules is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws, and the remainder shall remain in full force and effect.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>No Waiver.\n</b> Any failure of NetZero to enforce any provision of the Rules shall not constitute a waiver of any rights under such provision or
