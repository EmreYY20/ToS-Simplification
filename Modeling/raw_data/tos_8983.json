that enables you to use Cloning Voices to generate voice recordings that sound like a Consenting Speaker by typing new words.\nA \"Cloning Voice\" is an AI model trained on voice recordings of a Consenting Speaker.\nA \"Consenting Speaker\" is an individual (including yourself) who has provided explicit consent to use recordings of their voice to train a Cloning Voice and to generate and use their voice in the manner described in this document.</p>\n<p>You can create new Cloning Voices by submitting voice recordings of a Consenting Speaker as training audio (\u201cTraining Audio\u201d).\nBy submitting Training Audio to Voicemaker, you give your consent (and represent and warrant that you have obtained the consent of any third-party Consenting Speakers) for us to use and store the audio recordings and voices you submit as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to use your voice, and the voice of any third-party Consenting Speakers, to train a Cloning Voice, to synthesis and use such voices as described in this document, and to otherwise operate the Service;</li>\n<li>as part of our research datasets to analyze, maintain, and improve our voice technology and other technology, and for other research and development and data analysis purposes, provided that if we add your Training Audio to our research datasets, we first anonymize the data so it is no longer associated with your account.\nPlease write to us at support@voicemaker.in, if you would like to opt out of the use of your data for this purpose;</li>\n<li>Voicemaker employees and contractors may listen to audio samples of your Training Audio and your synthesis audio in order to test the quality of your Cloning Voice.\nand Voicemaker employees may use your Cloning Voice to create a series of non-defamatory utterances, solely for internal quality assurance purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Aside from the above described use, only you and those you explicitly share access with will have the ability to generate synthesized audio using your Cloning Voice.\nVoicemaker will not share your Training Audio or your Cloning Voice with third parties except as explicitly described above and in our Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>You agree to only submit audio of Consenting Speakers.\nSubmitting unauthorized voice recordings of third parties as training audio or otherwise is strictly prohibited.\nYou represent and warrant that you will not submit any recording to Voicemaker that contains the voice of any speakers that have not explicitly consented to have their Cloning Voice created and to have their voices generated and used in the manner described in this document.</p>\n<br>Commercial Rights<p>You are allowed to use voices created by Voicemaker for commercial purposes, and to distribute or make them available to third parties for commercial use.\nHowever, you agree that the commercial rights do not include reselling rights and you cannot resell or offer to resell Voicemaker's offerings to any

Warranty<p>Voicemaker and its affiliates do not provide any guarantees about their services and provide them \"as is\" and \"as available\".\nThey also disclaim any implied or statutory warranties, including accuracy of data, non-infringement, and fitness for a specific purpose, to the fullest extent allowed by law.</p>Exclusion of Liability<ul>\n<li>To the fullest extent permitted by law, and unless Voicemaker has entered into a separate written agreement that overrides this user agreement, Voicemaker, including its affiliates, will not be liable in connection with this user agreement for lost profits or lost business opportunities, reputational damage (e.g., offensive or defamatory statements), loss of data (e.g., down time or loss, use of, or changes to, your information or content), or third-party policies (such as YouTube refusing to allow monetization of videos with synthesized voices or ACX declining text-to-speech based audio books, Meta (Facebook or Instagram) blocked video due to synthesized voices), API abuse and misuse or any indirect, incidental, consequential, special or punitive damages.</li>\n<li>Voicemaker and its affiliates will not be liable to you in connection with this user agreement for any amount that exceeds the total fees paid or payable by you to Voicemaker for the services during the term of this user agreement, if any.</li>\n</ul>Basis of the Bargain.\nExclusions<p>The limitations of liability outlined in this Section - Disclaimer and Limit of Liability are an integral part of the agreement between you and Voicemaker, and will apply to all types of liability, including but not limited to warranty, tort, negligence, contract and law.\nThese limitations will apply even if Voicemaker or its affiliates have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if these remedies fail to achieve their intended purpose.</p>\n<p>However, these limitations do not apply in cases of death or personal injury, fraud, gross negligence or intentional misconduct, or in cases of negligence where a material obligation has been breached.\nA material obligation is one that is essential for the delivery of services and on which you can reasonably rely.\nThe limitations will only apply in cases where the damages were directly caused by the breach and were foreseeable upon conclusion of this User Agreement, and to the extent that they are typical in the context of this User Agreement.</p>\n<br>Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and Jury Waiver<p>Please take the time to carefully read the following paragraphs, as they outline the agreement between you and Voicemaker to resolve any disputes through binding individual arbitration.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The arbitration agreement outlined in this Section - Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and Jury Waiver, applies to all claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including all statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to this User Agreement or the use of the Services that cannot be resolved in small claims court, and will be resolved through binding individual arbitration.\nThe only exception to this is disputes related to the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents.\nAdditionally, disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim, including disputes about the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity of the arbitration agreement, will be decided by the arbitrator.</li>\n<li>The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision.\nThe arbitration will be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) and will be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, or an alternative arbitral forum if the AAA is not available.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator.\nAny claims or disputes where the total amount sought is less than $10,000 USD may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.</li>\n<li>In the event that non-appearance arbitration is chosen, the arbitration process can be conducted through a combination of methods such as telephone, online, or written submissions.\nThe party initiating the arbitration will determine the specific manner of arbitration.\nUnless both parties mutually agree otherwise, the arbitration will not require any in-person appearances by the parties or witnesses.</li>\n<li>The arbitrator will have the authority to determine the jurisdiction of the arbitration and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Voicemaker.\nThe dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.\nThe arbitrator will have the power to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute and award monetary damages and any non-monetary remedy or relief available under law, the arbitral forum\u2019s rules, and the User Agreement.\nThe arbitrator will provide a written award and statement of decision that describes the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.\nThe arbitrator will have the same authority as a judge in a court of law to award relief on an individual basis and the award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Voicemaker.</li>\n<li>By agreeing to this User Agreement, you and Voicemaker are voluntarily waiving your constitutional and statutory rights to go to court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury.\nInstead, you and Voicemaker are electing to have claims and disputes resolved through arbitration.\nThe arbitration process is typically more streamlined, efficient, and cost-effective compared to court procedures and is subject to limited review by a court.\nIn the event of any litigation between you and Voicemaker over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, both parties waive all rights to a jury trial and instead opt for the dispute to be resolved by a judge.</li>\n<li>In accordance with this arbitration agreement, all claims and disputes must be resolved on an individual basis and cannot be resolved on a class-wide or consolidated basis.\nClaims or disputes from multiple customers or users cannot be arbitrated or litigated together.\nHowever, disputes regarding the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this waiver may be resolved by a court and not by an arbitrator.\nIf this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration and all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as outlined in Section - Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and Jury Waiver.</li>\n<li>Any rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted.\nSuch waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</li>\n<li>You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.\nIf you do so, neither you nor Voicemaker can force the other to arbitrate.\nTo opt out, you must notify Voicemaker in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.\nYour notice must include your name and address and the email address you used to set up your Voicemaker account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou must email your opt-out notice to support@voicemaker.in.</li>\n<li>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Voicemaker may bring an individual action in small claims court.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>General Terms<p>If a court with authority over this User Agreement finds any part of it unenforceable, you and we agree that the court should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent.\nIf the court cannot do that, you and we agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still enforce the rest of this User Agreement.</p>\n<p>This User Agreement (including additional terms that may be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only agreement between us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the Services.</p>\n<p>If we don't act to enforce a breach of this User Agreement, that does not mean that Voicemaker has waived its right to enforce this User Agreement.\nYou may not assign or transfer this User Agreement (or your membership or use of Services) to anyone without our consent.\nHowever, you agree that Voicemaker may assign this User Agreement to its affiliates or a party that buys it without your consent.\nThere are no third-party beneficiaries to this User Agreement.</p>\n<p>You agree that the only way to provide us legal notice is at the address provided in Section - How To Contact
