provisions.\nIf at any time you disagree with these Terms, you must refrain from installing our App, or, if you have already installed our App, refrain from accessing or using it and delete it.\nThese Terms contain the entire agreement between you and WiFi Map, and supersede any prior agreements or arrangements with you that relate in any way to WiFi Map or the App.</p>\n<p>WiFi Map reserves the right to immediately terminate these Terms and any services provided by WiFi Map, including its publication of the App and provision of any content, information, functionality or other services

Arbitration</p>\n<p>The New York state and United States federal courts sitting in NewYork County, New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any claims, disputes or controversies related to

ARBITRATION AWARD IS</p>\n<p>LIMITED.\nThere may be more limits on the availability and scope of discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow these Terms and can award the same damages and

court or (ii) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, the agreement to arbitrate in this Section 4 doesn't stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nThose agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).</p> ", "created_at": "2021-10-06 02:03:37.330568", "updated_at": "2023-11-01 16:58:26.944554"}, {"id": 9132, "name": "Privacy Policy", "url":

been authorized by the owner of the hotspot to upload the password through our App.\nIf you are not the owner of a hotspot, and have not been authorized by the owner of that hotspot to upload the password through our App, you must not upload the password for that hotspot.\nWe also collect information about WiFi signal strength, horizontal and vertical accuracy, speed test information, captive portal mode and the times at which your mobile device is connected to a particular hotspot.</p>\n<p>The hotspot data that we collect is made available to our other Users through our Apps.</p>\n<p>We
