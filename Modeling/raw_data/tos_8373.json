InGet Epic Games\nEPIC GAMES&nbsp;PRIVACY POLICY <p>Last&nbsp;Updated: March 14, 2023.</p>\n<p>Welcome to Epic!</p>\n<p>Epic Games, Inc.\nis headquartered in Cary, North Carolina.\nWe and our subsidiaries have offices and operations located around the world that help create and deliver some of your favorite products and services, including games like Fortnite and development tools like Unreal Engine (see \u201cOur Global Operations\u201d below).</p>\n<p>This privacy policy describes the different ways we may collect, use, and share information on, through, or in connection with the Epic Services (see \u201cWhat are the Epic Services?\u201d below).\nIf you have any questions, you can always reach out to us as described in \u201cContact Us\u201d below.</p>\n<p>When we refer to \u201cEpic\u201d (or any similar terms like \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) in this privacy policy, we mean the Epic Games entity that controls and is responsible for your information, including Epic Games, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries that help provide and support the Epic Services.\nYou can also find details about the data controller for personal information we collect through different Epic Services in \u201cContact Us\u201d below.<br>\n&nbsp;</p> 1.\nWHAT ARE THE EPIC SERVICES? <p>We use the term \u201cEpic Services\u201d to describe any Epic products or services that directly link to this privacy policy.\nThese include, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>games like&nbsp;Fortnite,&nbsp;Rocket League&nbsp;(through our subsidiary Psyonix), and&nbsp;Fall Guys&nbsp;(through our subsidiary Mediatonic);</li>\n<li>websites&nbsp;and applications such as&nbsp;www.epicgames.com&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Epic Games Store,&nbsp;Postparty (through Life on Air),&nbsp;www.rocketleague.com&nbsp;(through Psyonix), and&nbsp;www.fallguys.com&nbsp;(through Mediatonic).\nand</li>\n<li>developer tools, including the&nbsp;Developer Portal&nbsp;and&nbsp;Unreal Engine.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that your use of the Epic Services may also be subject to additional terms and conditions.\nFor example, you must review and accept the Fortnite End User License Agreement (link) to play Fortnite, the Psyonix Terms of Use (link) to play Rocket League, and the Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout \u2013 End User License Agreement (link) to play Fall Guys.</p>\n<p>Please read this entire privacy policy.\nYou should also carefully review any other agreements that apply to the Epic Services you use, and confirm you understand and agree to them, before using those products or services.<br>\n&nbsp;</p> 2.\nWHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT? <p>The types of information we collect depend on how you interact with us.\nGenerally speaking, we collect information in three main ways: A) when you provide it to us, B) automatically when you use the Epic Services, and C) from service providers and third parties.</p> &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nA.\nInformation You Provide <p>You can provide us with different kinds of information depending on how you interact with the Epic Services.\nSometimes we\u2019ll ask you to provide specific pieces of information, such as when we require it to provide parts of the Epic Services to you (for example, by prompting you to complete an online registration process).\nIf we ask you to provide us with information in these cases and you choose not to, you may not be able to access the relevant Epic Services and/or some features may not operate as intended.</p>\n<p>For instance, in order to make purchases on the Epic Games Store and to play some of our games, you\u2019ll need an Epic account.\nTo create one, you\u2019ll need to provide us with basic registration information like your name, a public-facing display name, password, the country you live in, and email address.\nIf you want to make a purchase, we may ask you to provide payment-related information (like your credit card number and expiration date) to complete the transaction.</p>\n<p>We also collect the information you voluntarily provide to sign up for email alerts, use social features like forums or chat, register for early access to our games, use our developer tools (including to create and publish games and other content), complete surveys, or contact us through Player Support requests or customer service.\nIf you enter a contest or competitive event, or participate in our&nbsp;Support-A-Creator&nbsp;program, we\u2019ll collect your application information and other information we may need to help confirm your eligibility and process payouts.\nWe collect whatever information you choose to provide to us in those or other similar cases.</p> &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;B.\nInformation We Collect Automatically <p>We collect some information automatically when you visit, access, or use the Epic Services.\nThis includes information about your gameplay or application usage, purchases, entitlements, and other activity in the Epic Services, typically associated with your account (if you are logged into your Epic account or use a third-party account to access the Epic Services) or with an identifier we have assigned to your device or profile.\nWhile the specific types of information that we automatically collect may vary, they generally include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Usage information and statistics about how you interact with the Epic Services, including the application you used or the game you played, how long you used or played it and when, gameplay attempts, progression and results, saved preferences, crash reports, the URLs of our websites that you have visited, URLs of referring and exiting pages, page views, time spent on a page, number of clicks, and platform type;</li>\n<li>Technical information about your computer, device, hardware, or software you use to access our services, such as IP address, device identifiers, your internet service provider,&nbsp;plugins, or other transactional or identifier information for your device (such as device make and model, information about device operating systems and browsers, or other device or system-related specifications).\nand</li>\n<li>The general location of your device, which we typically derive from your device\u2019s IP address.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Epic Services use technologies such as cookies, log files, and web beacons to automatically collect the types of information listed above.\nSome of these technologies may create small files or record-keeping tools that may be stored on your device.\nThey help us, our service providers, and third parties recognize your device and provide information about how you use and interact with the Epic Services.\nFor example, they&nbsp;support our ability to &nbsp;authenticate users, remember preferences, manage advertising, personalize experiences, and conduct data analytics.</p>\n<p>Please note that if certain features on the Epic Services are provided by third parties, those third parties may also use automated means of data collection and may record information about your use of the Epic Services or others\u2019 websites over time.\nThese features are subject to those third parties\u2019 privacy notices and policies.</p> &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;C.\nInformation We Collect from Other Sources <p>In some cases, we may also receive information about you from service providers and third parties in connection with your use of the Epic Services or your interactions with us on other platforms.</p>\n<p>For example, some other developers allow you to use your Epic account to log in to their service.\nAnd if you choose to link your Epic account with your account on a third-party social media (like Facebook), gaming (like Steam), or other similar website or service, or if you interact with an ad for one of the Epic Services on an external website or service, the company that operates that website or service may share some information with Epic in accordance with their own privacy practices.\nYour privacy settings on the other company\u2019s website or service typically control the specific types of information they can share with Epic, so please be sure to review and update them regularly.\nCommon examples for linked accounts might include your third-party account display name and user ID, as well as associated device information, name, and email address.\nFor participants in our Support-a-Creator program, we may also collect the number of social media account followers you have for program eligibility purposes.</p>\n<p>You can also buy, download, or access some Epic Services on or through services operated by third parties.\nIf you do, they may provide us with information to facilitate your access to and use of the Epic Services.\nThis typically includes information like your display name, user ID, and device and region information.\nFor example, you can choose to download and play games like Fortnite on gaming consoles (like PlayStation\u00ae, Microsoft Xbox, and Nintendo Switch) through your gaming console account.\nWhen you do, the company operating that platform or service may share some information with us, which helps us do things like facilitate your gameplay and track your progression and entitlements.</p> &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;D.\nFraud Prevention &amp.\nAnti-Cheat <p>Providing users with a fair, balanced, and competitive experience on the Epic Services is extremely important to us.\nWe strictly enforce prohibitions against cheating, hacking, account stealing, and any other unauthorized or fraudulent activity on the Epic Services.\nWe use a variety of anti-cheat and fraud prevention technologies to help us identify and prevent malicious activity.\nThese services may collect and analyze data about your computer and the software on your computer to detect cheating and may be provided by Epic or by service providers such as BattlEye.<br>\n&nbsp;</p> 3.\nHOW DO WE USE INFORMATION? <p>As a general matter, we use the information we collect (either individually or in combination with other information collected as described in this policy) to help us provide, improve, customize, analyze, and promote the Epic Services.</p>\n<p>This includes using it for purposes such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating, verifying, and managing user accounts and features;</li>\n<li>Providing the Epic Services, as well as support and assistance for them, including by responding to inquiries, processing transactions or requests, and communicating with users (such as by sending service and account-related messages and updates);</li>\n<li>Developing, delivering, and improving the Epic Services and other offerings, some of which may be offered in partnership with other parties;</li>\n<li>Personalizing your experience, including by presenting content or features better tailored to you or your interests, or our inferences about your interests (for instance, if you frequently play games in a certain genre, we may infer that you\u2019d be interested in that genre and suggest similar games to you);</li>\n<li>Promoting the Epic Services, including managing, customizing, and measuring the effectiveness of our advertisements, promotional offers, surveys, and events;</li>\n<li>Managing alpha, beta, or early access tests (and collecting feedback);</li>\n<li>Conducting data analytics (like analyzing how the Epic Services are used so we can better understand, improve, and personalize them);</li>\n<li>Complying with our legal or contractual obligations and enforcing our terms.\nand</li>\n<li>Securing the Epic Services, such as by detecting fraud and otherwise protecting Epic and other users from illegal or harmful actions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may also process information that does not identify you individually, including aggregate or de-identified information that we create or collect from other sources.\nThis information helps us better understand larger groups of users.\nIf we combine this information with information that identifies you, we will treat it as described in this privacy policy.\nBut please note that this privacy policy does not restrict our ability to process information that does not individually identify you, and we may use and disclose aggregated or de-identified information for any reason permitted by law.<br>\n&nbsp;</p> 4.&nbsp;HOW DO WE SHARE INFORMATION? <p>We may share some of the information we collect to help operate and improve the Epic Services.\nDepending on how you interact with us, common examples might include sharing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>With console and platform partners (for example, to facilitate gameplay when you access the Epic Services through a third-party console provider);</li>\n<li>With other game developers (such as to enable features for games you acquire through the Epic Games Store);</li>\n<li>With other users (like if you use social features such as chat);</li>\n<li>Publicly (for example, your display name, content you create or share, basic game statistics, and other similar information may be generally accessible to others);</li>\n<li>With service providers that operate on our behalf to help support the Epic Services in accordance with our instructions (for example, cloud storage providers, payment processors, or marketing and advertising partners);</li>\n<li>When we believe we must in order to comply with the law or to protect you, Epic, or others (for example, in response to court order or subpoena, as part of an investigation of fraud or other illegal activity, or violation of our terms or policies, or if necessary to protect others from death or serious harm to body or property);</li>\n<li>With other Epic entities (including to help provide support for the Epic Services internationally);</li>\n<li>In connection with certain types of corporate transactions (like in the event of a restructuring or the sale of all or a significant part of our business).\nand</li>\n<li>With your permission (for example, if you link external accounts with your Epic account, or use your Epic account to sign in to third-party games and services or participate in cross-promotional events).</li>\n<li>We may also share information that does not identify you with third parties, including aggregate or de-identified information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Third parties you interact with through Epic Services may have different privacy practices than Epic, so we encourage you to review their privacy policies before sharing your information with them.<br>\n&nbsp;</p> 5.&nbsp;CHILDREN\u2019S PRIVACY <p>The Epic Services are intended to be appropriate for general audiences and are not directed to children (usually considered to be under 13, depending on where you reside).\nEpic does not intentionally collect personal information from children without seeking any required parental approval in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory obligations, such as the U.S.\nChildren\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d).</p>\n<p>We may ask you to provide age-related information in order to help us comply with laws like COPPA.\nFor example, we may request your date of birth to determine whether COPPA requires us to obtain verifiable parental consent from your parent or guardian before allowing you to access the Epic Services.\nIf a user indicates they are a COPPA minor, we\u2019ll require that user to complete a parental approval process before continuing to access the relevant Epic Services.\nThis process is designed to notify parents that their child has requested access to the Epic Services, inform them about Epic\u2019s privacy practices, offer them the opportunity to approve Epic\u2019s collection and use of their child\u2019s information as described in this policy, and describe the controls that we make available to them.</p>\n<p>Once a parent provides their consent, we\u2019ll give them an opportunity to review and change important account settings that control how their child can interact with the Epic Services.\nTo learn more, see&nbsp;https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/parental-controls.\nParents are also generally free to change or revoke the choices they\u2019ve previously made, and can review the personal information associated with their child\u2019s account or request that we delete it from our systems.\nTo submit these requests or ask us any other questions you may have about how we handle your child\u2019s personal information, please see \u201cContact Us\u201d below.</p>\n<p>Authorized child accounts are otherwise treated much like other Epic accounts unless the settings are adjusted through the parental controls available at&nbsp;https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/parental-controls.\nThey can generally play approved games (such as Fortnite, Rocket League, or Fall Guys), access communications and social features (like chat and friends lists), and freely interact with most of the Epic Services (including downloading other games from the Epic Games Store).\nFor additional details, please see \u201cWhat Information Do We Collect?\u201d, \u201cHow Do We Use Information?\u201d, and \u201cHow Do We Share Information?\u201d above.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>SuperAwesome &amp.\nKids Web Services</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>The Epic Services use Kids Web Services (\u201cKWS\u201d) for parental and guardian verification purposes.\nKWS is a service focused on children\u2019s safety that is offered by our subsidiary SuperAwesome.\nWhen you verify with KWS, SuperAwesome will remember that you have been verified the next time you use your email address to manage your child\u2019s permission for other games or services powered by SuperAwesome so that you won\u2019t need to do so again.&nbsp;This means Epic and SuperAwesome are jointly responsible for how your personal information is used for parent verification services.</p>\n<p>You can&nbsp;learn more about SuperAwesome and KWS in SuperAwesome\u2019s privacy policy here:&nbsp;https://www.superawesome.com/kws-privacy-notice/.<br>\n&nbsp;</p> 6.&nbsp;YOUR CHOICES AND CONTROLS <p>We seek to provide you with meaningful choices about the personal information we collect.\nThe specific choices available to you often vary depending on the exact nature of our relationship with you, such as the Epic Services you use.\nCommon examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can request that we provide access to, or that we correct or delete, personal information we\u2019ve collected from you.\nPlease submit requests to access, update, or delete personal information associated with your Epic account by reaching out to us as described in \u201cContact Us\u201d below.\nNote that we may ask you for additional information to help us verify who you are before completing your request.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>You can change your email marketing preferences at any time, such as by using the opt-out mechanism provided in our marketing emails, updating your Epic account settings, or contacting us with your request (see \u201cContact Us\u201d below).</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>You can change your privacy settings on other parties\u2019 websites (such as social networks) or platforms (like console providers) to limit the information they may share with us.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>You can change your browser or mobile device settings to block, manage, delete, or limit tracking technologies like cookies.\nIn some cases, blocking or disabling cookies may cause the Epic Services not to work as intended and some features may not be available.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If you\u2019re&nbsp;under the age of 18 and have an Epic account, you&nbsp;can&nbsp;ask that we remove or anonymize certain content you\u2019ve&nbsp;provided on the Epic Services.&nbsp;Please direct requests to help delete or edit content on the Epic Services to Epic as described in \u201cContact Us\u201d below.</li>\n<li>Parents and guardians can adjust the settings for their child\u2019s Epic account by visiting&nbsp;https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/parental-controls.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some parts of the world provide individuals with specific choices related to their personal information by right under local law.<br>\n&nbsp;</p> 7.\nOUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS <p>Epic Games, Inc.\nis based in the United States, but we operate globally to help provide users all around the world with a better experience on the Epic Services.\nWe have subsidiaries, offices, service providers, and partners worldwide to support these operations in a number of different ways -- for example, the developer of Fall Guys is a subsidiary called Mediatonic Limited that is based in the United Kingdom.\nThis means that Epic may process the information we collect in connection with your use of the Epic Services in places outside the region where you reside.</p> &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nA.\nData Transfers <p>When you use the Epic Services, your information may be transferred to or stored in the United States or other countries where we or our service providers operate.\nThe data protection laws and rules in these countries may be different than those where you live.\nWe rely on various legal mechanisms to help lawfully support transfers of information outside the country of collection where appropriate.\nIf permissible under local law, you\u2019re authorizing Epic to process your information in any of the locations where we operate (including the United States) by using the Epic Services.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the Epic entity responsible for operating the Epic Services you use, see \u201cContact Us\u201d below.\n&nbsp;</p> &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nB.\nCalifornia Residents <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act or \u201cCCPA\u201d provides consumers residing in California certain rights with respect to their personal information.\nIf you are a California resident, you may have the right to: (1) request to know more about the categories and specific pieces of personal information we collect, use, and disclose.\n(2) request deletion of your personal information.\n(3) opt out of sale of your personal information (if any).\nand (4) not be discriminated against for exercising these rights.</p>\n<p>You or your authorized agent may make these requests by contacting us as described in \u201cContact Us\u201d below.\nNote that we may ask you for additional information to help us verify who you are before completing your request.\nIf we receive your request from an authorized agent, we may ask for evidence that you gave that person authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf.\nWe will not discriminate against you if you exercise your rights under the CCPA.</p>\n<p>In the past 12 months, we have collected the following categories of personal information, as described in the CCPA:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identifiers (such as email addresses);</li>\n<li>Demographic information (like ages);</li>\n<li>Commercial information (including entitlements or purchase history);</li>\n<li>Internet or electronic network activity (for example, gameplay or website usage details);</li>\n<li>Audio, electronic, visual, or similar information (like&nbsp;voice chat);</li>\n<li>Geolocation information (such as may be derived from your IP address or included in your billing information);</li>\n<li>Other \u201cpersonal information\u201d as defined under California law (like your credit or debit card information).\nand&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Inferences drawn from any of these categories (for example,&nbsp;about the genres of games you may prefer to play based on your purchase history).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For details about the precise data points we collect and the categories of sources where we got that information, please see \u201cWhat Information Do We Collect?\u201d above.\nWe collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in \u201cHow Do We Use Information?\u201d above.</p>\n<p>Epic does not sell the personal information we collect.\nWe do, however, disclose personal information as described in this policy (see \u201cHow Do We Share Information?\u201d above).\nIn the past 12 months, we have disclosed personal information to the following categories of recipients:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Business partners (for example,&nbsp;if you request that we share your email address with the developer of a game you purchase on the Epic Games Store);</li>\n<li>Other&nbsp;Epic entities (like to subsidiaries that may help support certain Epic Services);</li>\n<li>Other users (for example, if you use chat or social features on the Epic Services);</li>\n<li>Service providers (as&nbsp;described in \u201cHow Do We Share Information?\u201d above);</li>\n<li>Operating systems and platforms.\nand</li>\n<li>Government entities or other third parties in response to a legal request.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nC.\nResidents Of The European Economic Area, The United Kingdom, And Switzerland</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re&nbsp;located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom (UK), or&nbsp;Switzerland, you have certain rights regarding how your personal data is processed.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Data Subject Rights</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>You may have the right to access, correct, or delete personal data we have collected about you through the Epic Services.\nYou may also have the right to a portable copy of the personal data you have provided, and to object to or restrict processing of your personal data, such as for direct marketing.\nWhere you have provided your consent to our data processing, you have the right to withdraw consent.</p>\n<p>You also have the right to make a complaint against us by contacting your local supervisory authority for data protection (if one exists in your country).\nWe would, however, appreciate the chance to address your concerns before you contact a data protection regulator, and ask that you direct your complaint to us first.</p>\n<p>Please see the \u201cContact Us\u201d section below to learn more about reaching out to Epic with any relevant concerns you may have.\nYou can find more details about your local Data Protection Authority as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>EEA:&nbsp;https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en&nbsp.\n&nbsp;</li>\n<li>UK:&nbsp;https://ico.org.uk/global/contact-us/&nbsp.\n&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Switzerland:&nbsp;https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home/the-fdpic/contact.html</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Basis for Processing</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>The legal bases we rely on to process your personal data depend on the Epic Services you use and how you interact with them.\nThey primarily include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contractual Necessity: we process personal data to perform the Epic Services you requested under our Terms of Service or other similar contractual agreements with you.\nFor example, we process personal data to set up and maintain your account.\nprocess your purchases.\nauthenticate users.\nprovide user-experience features (like saving your preferences).\nmonitor and analyze the Epic Services.\ndetect and prevent fraud, cheating, or other similar misuse.\nfacilitate features like cross-progression that allow you to play a game on one platform and continue your progress on another, which may require us to share your information with third-party partners.\nand contact you about your account, transactions, or other updates.\nWe also rely on performance of a contract to manage our relationship with you, which includes responding to your support requests or general inquiries, and notifying you about changes to our applicable terms or policies.</li>\n<li>Legitimate Interests: we process personal data as needed for Epic\u2019s business purposes, as balanced against the potential impact on your privacy rights.\nThis includes many common purposes that you\u2019d reasonably expect, such as to: communicate with you, respond to your requests, or provide you with updates and information.\nbetter understand our users and their preferences.\npersonalize your experience, save your preferences, authenticate our users, and provide similar user experience features.\ndevelop, deliver, and improve the Epic Services and other offerings (some of which may be offered in partnership with other parties).\nmanage and customize advertisements or promotional offers.\nsecure and protect the Epic Services.\nprevent fraud and illegal activity.\nand support internal purposes such as auditing and data analysis.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Legal Obligations: we process personal data when necessary to comply with legal obligations, such as responding to legitimate requests from law enforcement authorities or other government officials in accordance with relevant legal processes.</li>\n<li>Consent: we process personal data when you provide us with your consent to do so.\nYou aren\u2019t required to provide consent if you do not want your personal data to be processed for the requested purposes, and you may withdraw your consent at any time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Retention</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>Because the specific personal data we process and our reasons for doing so often vary depending on how you use the Epic Services, how long we retain it can also vary.\nWe generally store personal data for as long as we reasonably need it for the purposes described in this policy (like complying with our legal obligations, managing internal records, enforcing our terms, and resolving disputes), unless a long retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>\n<p>The main criteria we consider in determining specific retention periods often include minimum requirements under applicable law, relevant industry standards, the types of data in question (such as its level of sensitivity), relevance to potential litigation or similar proceedings (like defending ourselves against legal claims), and whether the data is required to prevent fraud or similar abuse of the Epic Services (including to enforce prohibitions against cheating and other unauthorized behavior).\nFor example, if you create an Epic account, we will generally store the personal data associated with your Epic account for as long as needed to maintain your account, provide the Epic Services you requested, enforce any terms that apply and govern your use of the Epic Services, and maintain appropriate records to reflect how we deliver the Epic Services to you.</p>\n<p>To learn more about requesting that Epic delete your personal data, please see \u201cYour Choices and Controls\u201d and \u201cData Subject Rights\u201d above.<br>\n&nbsp;</p> 8.\nSECURITY <p>We maintain appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your personal information from accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure, or use and other unlawful forms of processing.\nIn some cases, your information is accessible when you log into a feature we offer, and in those cases you need to keep your user credentials and password confidential and secure so that your information is protected.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;</p> 9.\nUPDATES <p>We\u2019ll update this policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or relevant laws.\nWhen we do, we\u2019ll change the date noted at the top of the policy.\nIn some cases we may also notify you of the relevant changes by email or within the Epic Services.\nPlease review this policy regularly to make sure that you understand your relationship with Epic and the ways we may collect, use, and share information in connection with the Epic Services.<br>\n&nbsp;</p> 10.\nCONTACT US <p>If you have questions or concerns about the Epic Services (such as game-related issues, trouble accessing your Epic account, bugs
