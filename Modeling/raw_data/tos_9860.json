including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monitoring website stability</li>\n<li>Measuring website traffic</li>\n<li>Optimizing website content</li>\n<li>Helping make the website more useful to visitors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CMS staff analyzes the data collected from these tools.\nReports are available only to CMS managers, teams who implement programs represented on Medicaid.gov, members of the CMS communications and web teams, and other designated federal staff and contractors who need this information to perform their jobs.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nUsing third-party tools for outreach and education through digital advertising: <p>We use third-party web services to conduct outreach and education through the use of digital advertising for Medicaid.gov.\nThese third-party services may collect information through the use of web beacons (also called pixels) that are located on our pages.\nA web beacon is a see-through graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that's placed on a web page and, in combination with a cookie, allows us to collect information regarding the use of the web page that contains the web beacon.\n</p>\n<p>We use web beacons to tell when a user is redirected to Medicaid.gov by clicking or otherwise interacting with a CMS advertisement that we ran on another website.\nThis is known as \u201cclick tracking\u201d or \u201cconversion tracking,\u201d and we use it to better target CMS advertisements (known as \u201cretargeting\u201d) to inform consumers about the services available through Medicaid.gov.\nFor more information on how these tools work, see&nbsp;How CMS uses third-party websites &amp.\napplications with Medicaid.gov.\n</p>\n<p>We also use third-party tools to help deliver advertising.\nVendors that operate the third-party tools may also gather information about your visits to third-party sites outside of Medicaid.gov.\nWhile we don't track your internet activity outside of Medicaid.gov, our vendors may use information collected automatically by visiting Medicaid.gov, and combine it with data they collect elsewhere for targeted advertising purposes.\nYou can opt out of this type of data collection via Privacy Settings, Ad Choices, and Do Not Track.\nFor methods to opt out of this type of collection, see&nbsp;Your choices about tracking &amp.\ndata collection on Medicaid.gov.\n</p>\n<p>The outreach and education analytics tools provide reports which aggregate data like the number of clicks on advertisements.\nThe reports are available only to CMS managers, teams who implement programs represented on Medicaid.gov, members of the Medicaid.gov communications and web teams, and other designated federal staff and contractors who need this information to perform their duties.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nHow CMS uses cookies &amp.\nother technologies on Medicaid.gov <p>The Office of Management and Budget Memo&nbsp;M-10-22(link is external), Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies, allows federal agencies to use session and persistent cookies to improve the delivery of services.\n</p>\n<p>When you visit a website, its server may generate a piece of text known as a \u201ccookie\u201d to place on your device.\nThe cookie, which is unique to your browser, allows the server to \"remember\" specific information about your visit while you\u2019re connected.\nThe cookie makes it easier for you to use the dynamic features of web pages.\nInformation that you enter into Medicaid.gov isn\u2019t associated with cookies on Medicaid.gov.\nDepending on the third-party tool\u2019s business practices, privacy policies, terms of service, and/or the privacy settings you selected, information you\u2019ve provided to third parties could be used to identify you when you visit Medicaid.gov.\nThese third parties don\u2019t/won\u2019t share your identity with CMS or the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n</p>\n<p>There are 2 types of cookies - single session (temporary) and multi-session (persistent).\nSingle session cookies last only as long as your internet browser is open.\nOnce you close your browser, the session cookie disappears.\nPersistent cookies are stored on your device for longer periods.\nBoth types of cookies create an ID that\u2019s unique to your device.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Session cookies</strong>: We use session cookies for technical purposes, like to allow better navigation through our website.\nThese cookies let our server know that you\u2019re continuing a visit to our website.\nThe OMB Memo M-10-22 Guidance defines our use of session cookies as \"Usage Tier 1\u2014Single Session.\u201d The policy says, \"This tier encompasses any use of single session web measurement and customization technologies.\"</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Persistent cookies</strong>: We use persistent cookies to understand the differences between new and returning visitors to Medicaid.gov.\nPersistent cookies remain on your device between visits to our website until they expire or are removed by the user.\nThe OMB Memorandum M-10-22 Guidance defines our use of persistent cookies as \"Usage Tier 2\u2014Multi-session without personally identifiable information.\u201d The policy says, \"This tier encompasses any use of multi-session web measurement and customization technologies when no PII is collected.\" We don\u2019t use persistent cookies to collect PII.\nWe don\u2019t identify a user by using cookies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CMS also uses these technologies on Medicaid.gov:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Persistent cookies for digital advertising</strong>: Similar to persistent cookies identified above, CMS uses persistent cookies for outreach through digital advertising.\nThese cookies can also be created on third-party websites and remain on your device between visits to our website until they expire or you remove them.\nConsistent with OMB guidance for \u201cUsage Tier 2\u201d, we don\u2019t use persistent cookies for outreach to collect PII.\nCMS doesn\u2019t identify a user by using such technologies.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Web beacons for digital advertising (also called pixels and/or tracking tags)</strong>: See-through images placed on certain pages of Medicaid.gov are typically used in conjunction with cookies and aren\u2019t stored on your device.\nWhen you access these pages, web beacons generate a notice of your visit.\nFor information on how we use web beacons, see&nbsp;How CMS uses third-party websites &amp.\napplications with Medicaid.gov.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Website log files</strong>: These are used as an analysis tool and to tell how visitors use Medicaid.gov, how often they return, and how they navigate through the website.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Flash</strong>: Flash is used to assess the performance of the site and as a player for selected videos depending on the browser a device is using.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Local Storage Objects</strong>: We use Flash Local Storage Objects (\u201cLSOs\u201d) to store your preferences and to personalize your visit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\nYour choices about tracking &amp.\ndata collection on Medicaid.gov <p>Medicaid.gov offers Privacy Settings&nbsp;which gives you control over what tracking and data collection takes place during your visit.\nThird-party tools are enabled by default to provide a quality consumer experience.\n</p>\n<p>The Privacy Settings provide&nbsp;you with the choice to opt in or to opt out of the different categories of third-party tools used by Medicaid.gov: Advertising, Analytics, or Social Media.\nThe Privacy Settings prevents cookies, web beacons, and Local Storage Objects from being placed on your device.\nThe Privacy Settings also prevents third-party tools from loading regardless of your cookie settings, which provides you with an additional layer of privacy that prevents the tool from loading at all.\nBecause the Privacy Settings creates a cookie in your browser, the opt in and opt out choices you make through the Privacy Settings will only be effective on the device and browser you used to make your choices, and your choices will expire when the cookie expires.\nOnce the cookie is created, the Privacy Settings will retain your settings for 3 years from the date of your most recent visit.\nYou may revisit the Privacy Settings to change or renew your choices at any time.\n</p>\n<p>If you disable cookies in your browser, our Privacy Settings won\u2019t be able to store your preferences and won\u2019t function properly.\nIf you don\u2019t wish to use our Privacy Settings to opt out of the tools used by Medicaid.gov, you can opt out of tools individually, or via the Digital Advertising Alliance (\u201cDAA\u201d) AdChoices icon, discussed in the next subsection.\n</p>\n<p>If you opt out of the tools used by Medicaid.gov via the Privacy Settings or by opting out of the tools directly, you\u2019ll still have access to information and resources at Medicaid.gov.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>AdChoices</strong>: We include the AdChoices icon on all digital advertising that uses \u201cconversion tracking\u201d or \u201cretargeting.\u201d To learn about conversion tracking, targeted advertising, and retargeting, see&nbsp;How CMS uses third-party websites &amp.\napplications with Medicaid.gov.\nThe AdChoices icon is usually at or near the corner of digital ads.\nWhen you click on the AdChoices icon, it will provide information on what company served the ad and information on how to opt out.\nLearn more about AdChoices.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Do Not Track</strong>: We automatically observe the \u201cDo Not Track\u201d browser setting for digital advertising that uses \u201cconversion tracking\u201d or \u201cretargeting.\u201d If \u201cDo Not Track\u201d is set before a device visits Medicaid.gov, third-party conversion tracking and retargeting tools won\u2019t load on the website.\nTo learn more about conversion tracking and retargeting, see&nbsp;How CMS uses third-party websites &amp.\napplications with Medicaid.gov.&nbsp;Learn more about Do Not Track and how to set the Do Not Track setting in your browser(link is external).\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nHow CMS uses third-party websites &amp.\napplications with Medicaid.gov <p>Medicaid.gov uses a variety of technologies and social media services to communicate and interact with the public.\nThese third-party websites and applications include popular social networking and media websites, open source software communities, and more.\n</p>\nThird-party websites: <p>Your activity on the third-party websites that Medicaid.gov links to (like Facebook or Twitter) is governed by the security and privacy policies of those websites.\nYou should review the privacy policies of all websites before using them so you understand how your information may be used.\n</p>\nWebsite analytics tools: <p>These tools collect basic site usage information, like:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How many visits Medicaid.gov gets</li>\n<li>The pages visited</li>\n<li>Time spent on Medicaid.gov</li>\n<li>The number of return visits to Medicaid.gov</li>\n<li>The approximate geographic location of the device used to access Medicaid.gov</li>\n<li>Types of devices used</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This information is used to maintain the website, including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monitoring website stability</li>\n<li>Measuring website traffic</li>\n<li>Optimizing website content</li>\n<li>Improving your experience</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Use the Medicaid.gov Privacy Settings to opt out of website analytics tools.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nDigital advertising tools for outreach &amp.\neducation: <p>We use third-party tools to support our digital advertising outreach and education efforts.\nThese tools enable us to reach new people and provide information to previous visitors.\nTo use these tools, we use these technologies on Medicaid.gov:\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Click tracking</strong>: We use click tracking to identify the ads that are most helpful to consumers and efficient for outreach.\nThis enables us to improve the performance of ads that consumers click on.\nWhen users click on links from ads, data about what ad was viewed is collected.\nReports are generated about ad performance \u2013 including the total number of views and clicks an ad received.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Conversion tracking</strong>: We use conversion tracking to identify ads that are helpful to consumers and efficient for outreach.\nIt enables us to improve the performance of ads viewed by consumers.\nWhen a Medicaid.gov ad is viewed on a third-party site (like a banner ad), a cookie is placed in the browser of the device the ad was viewed on.\nIf this device later visits Medicaid.gov, the visit is linked to the ad viewed on the same device.\nUse the Medicaid.gov Privacy Settings to opt out of advertising tools.\nUsers can click on the \u201cAdChoices\u201d icon in the corner of our ads to opt out of this Ad Targeting.\nUsers who have set their browser to \u201cDo Not Track\u201d will automatically be opted out of conversion tracking.\nFor more information about AdChoices and Do Not Track, see&nbsp;Your choices about tracking &amp.\ndata collection on Medicaid.gov.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Retargeting</strong>: We use retargeting to provide information to consumers who have previously visited Medicaid.gov, like reminders about upcoming enrollment deadlines.\nRetargeting enables us to improve the performance of ads by delivering them to relevant audiences, like recent visitors to Medicaid.gov.\nDuring a visit to Medicaid.gov, a cookie is placed in the browser of the devices used to view the website.\nWhen that same device is used to visit third-party websites that are displaying Medicaid.gov ads, ads for Medicaid.gov may be shown to that device because it had previously visited Medicaid.gov.\nUsing these cookies, we don't collect information about the third-party websites visited by a device.\nReports are generated about ad performance \u2013 including the total number of views and clicks an ad received.\nUse the Medicaid.gov Privacy Settings&nbsp;to opt out of advertising tools.\nUsers can click on the \u201cAdChoices\u201d icon in the corner of our ads to opt out of this Ad Targeting.\nUsers who have set their browser to \u201cDo Not Track\u201d will automatically be opted out of conversion tracking.\nFor more information about AdChoices and Do Not Track, see&nbsp;Your choices about tracking &amp.\ndata collection on Medicaid.gov.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Targeted advertising</strong>: We use third-party vendors to engage in targeted advertising (also called online behavioral or interest-based advertising) to provide information to consumers across their online activities.\nTargeted advertising involves the collection of data from a particular computer or device.\nData regarding web viewing behaviors or application use is gathered to predict user preferences or interests.\nWe can have ads delivered to computers or devices based on the preferences or interests inferred from the web-viewing behaviors or application use.\n</p>\n<p>Third-party vendors engaged by us may also target advertising based on information automatically collected (not information you provide) when you browse our websites or other websites on the internet.\nYou can opt out of this type of data collection via our Privacy Settings, Ad Choices, and Do Not Track.\nFor methods to opt out of this type of collection, see&nbsp;Your choices about tracking &amp.\ndata collection on Medicaid.gov.\n</p>\n<p>We may consider new third-party tools or the use of new third-party websites, but we'll first assess the tool or website before it\u2019s used in connection with Medicaid.gov.\nWe'll provide notice to the public before adding any new tool to Medicaid.gov.\nThese assessments include a description about how information will be collected, accessed, secured, and stored.&nbsp;See a list of the third-party tools currently being used on Medicaid.gov.\nSee risk assessments for third-party websites and applications(link is external).\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nHow CMS protects your personal information <p>You don\u2019t have to give us personal information when you visit Medicaid.gov, but if you want to get alerts or e-newsletters, you\u2019ll need to give us your email address to subscribe.\n</p>\n<p>If you choose to give us PII in an email, request for information, paper or electronic form, questionnaire, survey, etc., we\u2019ll the information you give us only long enough to respond to your question or to fulfill the stated purpose of the communication.\n</p>\n<p>If we need to contact you, we\u2019ll save your personal information in a record system designed to retrieve information about you by personal identifier (name, personal email address, home mailing address, personal or mobile phone number, etc.) and keep the information you give us safe according to the&nbsp;Privacy Act of 1974(link is external), as amended (5 U.S.C.\nSection 552a(link is external)).\n</p>\n<p>If we have a record system to retrieve information about you so we can carry out our mission, a Privacy Act&nbsp;Statement should be prominently displayed out in the open on the public-facing website or form asking you for PII.\nThe statement has to address these 5 criteria:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The legal authorization we have to collect information about you</li>\n<li>Why we\u2019re collecting information</li>\n<li>Routine ways we disclose information outside of our websites</li>\n<li>Whether or not you legally have to give us the information we\u2019re asking for</li>\n<li>What happens if you choose to not us the information we\u2019re asking for</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For more information about Medicaid.gov\u2019s privacy policy, email&nbsp;Privacy@cms.hhs.gov(link sends email).\n</p>\n<p>Third-party services are web-based technologies that
