formation, are governed by the laws of your country of residence.\nAny dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms, including any question regarding existence, validity or termination of these Terms, shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the competent courts of your country of residence.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>An alternative dispute resolution procedure is offered by the European Commission to citizens of EU and EEA member states through the platform for Online Dispute Resolution available at the following address: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr.\nWe are neither required nor willing to participate in a dispute resolution procedure before a consumer arbitration board.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Open Source.\n</strong>Aspects of our Services may contain open source software.\nEach item of open source software is subject to its own applicable license terms, which can be found at Pico Open Source Notice.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> These Terms, and the documents referred to in it, embodies the entire agreement and understanding between the you and us relating to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings relating to our Services.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>No Waiver.</strong> Our failure to insist upon or enforce any provision of these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Severability.</strong> If any court of law, having jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is illegal or invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms, and the remaining provisions of the Terms shall continue to be valid and enforceable, as long as the removed provisions are not essential obligations under these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Party Rights</strong>: Where these Terms are subject to English law, a person who is not a party to these Terms has no right under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 2001 to enforce any of these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>21.</strong>\n<strong>SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS \u2013 JURISDICTION SPECIFIC</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Germany</strong>\n</p>\n<p>For users that have their habitual residence in Germany, the following rules apply and supersede any conflicting provisions in the Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Limitation of Liability</u>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Pico shall be fully liable for intent and gross negligence as well as for damages caused by injury to life, body or health.\nIn an event of slight negligence, we shall be liable only for breaches of a material contractual obligation, limited to the typical and foreseeable damages at the time the contract was concluded.\nA material contractual obligation in the meaning of this provision is an obligation whose fulfilment makes the implementation of this contract possible in the first place and of which the contractual partner may therefore generally rely.\nAny potential liability on the part of Pico for any guarantees and for claims based on the German Product Liability Act shall not be affected.\nThe limitation of liability shall apply mutatis mutandis to the benefit of the employees, agents and vicarious agents of Pico.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>France</strong>\n</p> As a consumer, you have the following statutory rights and guarantees in relation to the Services and Digital Products.\nPico will therefore offer you the protection granted by law under the legal warranty of conformity provided by articles L.\n224-25-12 to L.\n224-25-26 of the French Consumer Code.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>\n<u>Guarantee of conformity</u>\n</strong>\n<br>\n<br> Pico is liable for supplying digital contents and services that comply with the contract with the objective and subjective criteria set out by the law.\nRegarding one-off supply, Pico is accountable for any non-conformity that exists at the time of supply and becoming apparent within two years of supply.\nRegarding digital content of service supplied on a continuous basis, Pico is accountable for any non-conformity which becomes apparent during the period in which it is supplied under the contract.\nPico is also accountable, within the same time limits, for any non-conformity resulting from the incorrect integration of the digital content or service into the consumer's digital environment where this has been done by Pico or under its responsibility, or where the incorrect integration by the consumer is the result of deficiencies in the instructions provided by Pico.\n<br>\n<br> For the 12 month period following the supply of the Services or Digital Product, you will not be required to prove the existence of the defect.\n<br> In the event of lack of conformity, you shall be entitled to have the Service or Digital Product brought into conformity or, failing that, to have the price reduced or to cancel the contract, under the below conditions<br>\n<br> - Compliance shall be achieved at no cost to you, without undue delay following you request and without significant inconvenience, taking into account the nature of the Service or Digital Product concerned and the use that you intended;<br>\n<br>- You shall not be required to pay for the use you made of the Service or Digital Product during the period, prior to termination of the contract, in which that Service or Digital Product was not in conformity.<br>\n<br>- You are entitled to a reduction in price or to rescission of the contract in the following cases:<br>\n<br>1.\nWhere Pico refuses to bring the digital content or service into conformity;<br>\n<br>2.\nWhere the bringing into conformity of the Service or Digital Product is unjustifiably delayed or causes costs or major inconvenience to you;<br>\n<br>3.\nWhere the non-conformity of the Service or Digital Product persists despite Pico's unsuccessful attempt to bring it into conformity;<br>\n<br>You shall also be entitled to a price reduction or rescission of the contract where the lack of conformity is so serious as to justify immediate price reduction or rescission of the contract.\nYou are then not obliged to ask for the Service or Digital Product to be brought into conformity beforehand.\nHowever, the contract may not be rescinded if the lack of conformity is minor, which is for Pico to demonstrate (this shall not apply to contracts where you do not pay a price).<br>\n<br>When you choose to obtain a price reduction or to cancel the contract, you shall inform Pico of your decision to obtain a price reduction.\nThe price reduction shall be proportionate to the difference between the value of the Service or Digital Content provided and the value of that Service or Digital Content in the absence of the lack of conformity.\nThe refund to the consumer of any sums due by Pico, or any other benefit received under the contract, shall be made without undue delay and at the latest within 14 days from the day on which you inform Pico of your decision to exercise your right to reduce the price or rescind the contract.\nPico shall reimburse these sums using the same means of payment as the one you used at the time of the conclusion of the contract, unless you expressly agree otherwise and in any case without any additional cost.<p>\n</p>",

Policy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<em>Last Updated: [ May] 2022</em>\n<br>\n<br>This Cookie Policy applies whenever you access and use the Pico Services.\n\u201cPico Services\u201d include our websites, applications, content, hardware and services (collectively, the \u201c<strong>Pico Services</strong>\u201d).<br>Like many websites and apps, the Pico Services use cookies and other tracking technologies such as software development kits (<strong>SDKs</strong>), pixels and local storage.\nThese technologies allow us to store information or gain access to information stored on your device to enable certain features and distinguish your device from others.\nTracking technologies are used by most apps and website providers to recognise that a device is the same as one used previously, for security, to remember user preferences and to generally improve user experience.\nThis Policy explains what these technologies are and how we use them.<br>\n<strong>1.\nWhat technologies are used?</strong>\n<br>The Pico Services use the following kinds of technologies:<br>\n<u>Cookies</u>: Cookies are small text files that enable us and our service providers and partners to uniquely identify your browser or device for various purposes, including those described above.\nCookies normally work by assigning a unique number to your device and are stored on your browser by the websites that you visit as well as third party service providers and partners to those websites.\n<br>Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time.\nSome cookies are \"session cookies\", meaning that they exist only while your browser is open and are deleted automatically once you close your browser.\n<br>Other cookies are \"persistent cookies\", meaning that they survive after your browser is closed.\nMost persistent cookies are set to automatically expire after a defined duration (for example, a few days, weeks or months).\nWhen you return to that website (or visit other websites that use the same cookies) the website provider or its service providers can recognise the persistent cookies they have set and recognise your browsing device.<br>\n<u>Local storage</u>: Local storage files are created by apps and websites to store information locally on your device.\nThey are very similar to cookies, but can have slightly different properties (for example, local storage can be used to store more information and can be stored in a different location on your device to cookies).\nLocal storage is normally used to speed up app and site functionality and remember your preferences.<br>\n<u>SDKs</u>: SDKs are pieces of code that enable data to be collected about your device, network and interaction with a website.\nLike cookies, they generally operate by assigning your device a unique number.<br>\n<strong>2.\nCategories of tracking technologies</strong>\n<br>The types of tracking technologies used by us and our partners in connection with the provision of the Pico Services can be classified into the following categories.\nSome of these categories are \u201cessential\u201d to provide you with the services you have requested, such as to securely log into the Pico Services.\nThe following is a list of of the categories of tracking technologies we use:<br>\n<u>Identification and security</u>: We recognise you when you return to the Pico Services to make sure that you are the right user and to prevent activity that violates our policies.\nFor example, we check what country you are using the Pico Services from to detect if someone may be trying to fraudulently access your account.<br>\n<u>Remembering your preferences</u>: We need to remember the settings you have chosen on the Pico Services so that they work how you want them to.\nFor example, we use these technologies in order to remember what languages you want to see content in, and the privacy settings you apply to your account.\n<br>\n<u>Functionality</u>: Functionality tracking technologies help to make the Pico Services work more efficiently and to improve and optimize your experience.\nFor example, we determine which device you use, the software version and the screen dimensions so that we can ensure that our app functions correctly.\n<br>\n<u>Analytics</u>: We use analytics tracking technologies to analyse how you use the Pico Services, including which pages you view most often, how you interact with the content, measure any errors that occur and test different design ideas.\nThe information is used to report and evaluate your activities and patterns as a user of the Pico Services.\nFor example, we may test new features to help us decide which features users prefer.<br>\n<strong>3.\nDo other parties use these technologies on the Pico Services?</strong>\n<br>Tracking technologies can either be \u201cfirst-party\u201d or \u201cthird-party\u201d.\nFirst-party tracking technologies refer to tracking technologies that we set and use directly.\nThird-party tracking technologies refer to tracking technologies set by third parties (such as analytics service providers).<br>We only use first-party tracking technologies on the Pico Services.<br>\n<strong>4.\nHow can I control these technologies?</strong>\n<br>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject non-essential cookies.\nYou can exercise your cookie preferences through our Cookie Settings which can be found <em>\n<u>here</u>\n</em>.<br>You can also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies.\nAs the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser to browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information.<br>If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use the Pico Services though your access to some functionality and areas of the Pico Services may be restricted.\n<br>\n<strong>5.\nWhere can I find more information about these technologies?</strong>\n<br>If you would like to find out more about these technologies, you may find the following links useful:<br>\n<u>All about cookies</u>\n<br>\n<u>EU Guide to Cookies</u>\n<br>\n<u>Your Online Choices</u>\n<br>\n<strong>6.\nChanges to this Policy</strong>\n<br>We will occasionally update this Policy to reflect changes in our practices.\nWhen we post changes to this Policy, we will revise the \"Last Updated\" date at the top of this Policy.\nIf we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share information using these technologies, we will notify you by prominently posting notice of the changes in the Pico Services.\nWe recommend that you check this page from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Policy.<br>\n<strong>7.\nContact us</strong>\n<br>If you have any questions or comments about this Policy, or privacy matters generally, contact us at: <strong>privacy@picoxr.com.\n</strong>\n</p>",
