FOUNDATION</strong>\n<p>The Site uses cookies.\n(A cookie is a small amount of data\u2014sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer\u2019s hard drive\u2014that may be accessed when you use a website.) Cookies are used primarily as follows: (1) to help deliver advertisements, and in particular to spare users the irritation of seeing the same pop-up ads repeatedly in the same visit.\n(2) to store information so that you will not have to reenter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Site.\n(3) to track usage throughout the Site (e.g., tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the Site, etc.).\n(4) to monitor aggregate metrics, such as the total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.\nMost web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.\nHowever, certain features of the Site may not work if you delete or disable cookies.</p>\n<p>In addition, when you visit the Site, some basic technical information may be collected by us or by a third party that provides us with Site usage information, including your IP address, domain name (e.g., whether you logged on from AOL.com or WhiteHouse.gov), referral data (e.g., the address of the last website you visited prior to clicking through to the Site), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Firefox browser on a Macintosh platform).</p>\n<p>Information about users and usage of the Site may be merged into aggregated data, which may then be used by the Foundation and/or shared with our advertisers and others.\nWe generally receive only aggregate information about Site usage, which is not linked to any identifiable individual.\nIf we provide aggregated information to outside companies, they will not be able to identify you or contact you based on that data.\nWe will not disclose personally identifiable information about you, except to the degree that you disclose it through your comments or Profile Page, or as provided in this Privacy Policy, or with your permission.</p>\n<strong>5.\nUSAGE INFORMATION: USE BY ADVERTISERS AND OTHERS</strong>\n<p>The Site includes advertisements placed by advertisers or ad networks.\nThese companies use technology to deliver advertisements you see on the Site and other websites directly to your Web browser.\nIn doing so, they automatically receive your IP address.\nCompanies that place advertising on the Site also have the ability to use cookies or Web beacons to collect information, such as your \"click stream\" (your viewing and/or purchasing behavior) and information about your usage of the Site.\nAdditionally, other companies may also use and track this type of information for <em>Mother Jones</em> to provide and improve the Site, to provide tailored services to you, and for other purposes.\nWe also use advertising features from Facebook and Google Analytics, which provide aggregated information on user demographics and interests.\nYou can see which data Facebook collects on you here, and you can opt out of the Google features here.</p>\n<p>We do not control the processes that advertisers and other companies use to collect information.\nHowever, cookies and web beacons alone generally cannot be used to identify individuals, only computers.\nTherefore, these companies generally will not know who you are unless you provide additional information to them, by responding to an advertisement, by entering into an agreement with the company, by creating an account with the company, or by some other means.\nOur systems do not recognize browser \"Do Not Track\" signals, but several of our service providers who utilize these cookies or web beacons on the Site enable you to opt out of targeted advertising practices.\nTo learn more about these advertising practices or to opt out of this type of advertising, you can visit www.networkadvertising.org and www.aboutads.info/choices.\nWe also provide you with additional tools to opt out of marketing from us.\nYou can learn about this in Section 11 below.</p>\n<p>The Site may also contain links to sponsor, advertiser, or other third-party websites that are not owned or controlled by the Foundation.\nWe have no control over, and we assume no responsibility for, the conduct, practices, or privacy policies of others.\nYou should review the privacy polices of the companies who operate those websites.</p>\n<strong>7.\nINFORMATION REGARDING SUBSCRIBERS AND DONORS</strong>\n<p>When you subscribe to our magazine (either the print or the digital edition), subscribe to our online newsletter, or make a donation, you may provide us with your name, physical address, and email address.\nYou may also provide credit card account information.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Foundation does not retain or use any credit card or other financial account information.\nThat information is conveyed to third-party payment services, and is used only to clear the payment for your
