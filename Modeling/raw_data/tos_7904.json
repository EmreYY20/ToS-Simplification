membership subscriptions to other users of the Site in exchange for membership benefits, which may be facilitated through the Site (each user of the Site paying for such membership subscription, a \"<strong>Community Member</strong>\").\nSaid membership benefits may include, without limitation, access to content or information that is exclusive to your Community Members (collectively, \"<strong>Creator Content</strong>\"), the ability for your Community Members to send and receive messages directly to you and/or between themselves, and/or merchandise or other tangible items that you make available to your Community Members (collectively, \"<strong>Benefits</strong>\").\nIf you are using the Site as a Creator, then the provisions of this Section 4 apply to you and shall prevail in the event of any conflict with any other provisions of these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.2.\nCreator Payments, Fees &amp.\nRefunds.</strong> When you offer Benefits as a Creator through the Site, we facilitate payments made by your Community Members to you.\nPayment processing, including refunds, shall be managed by the payment platform utilized by Company from time to time and may include the use of a third-party payment processing service provider.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.2.1 Payments Made to You.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(A) If Company utilizes Stripe, Inc.\nfor payments made by your Community Members through the Site, you agree that any such payments shall be collected and processed via Stripe, Inc., available at https://stripe.com (\"Stripe\"), and that in order to use the Site as a Creator you must: (a) create your own Stripe account.\n(b) agree to and abide by all of Stripe's own legal terms and conditions.\nand (c) cooperate with us in order to properly integrate your Stripe account with the Site, as reasonably directed by us.\nPayments made by your Community Members will be deposited directly by Company into your Stripe account in a timely manner after deduction of the following fees: (i) certain processing fees which are applied by Stripe, or which are applied by banks and/or other financial institutions not affiliated with us (collectively, \"Processing Fees\").\n(ii) the \"Locals Platform Fee\" which is 10% of all Subscription Fees received by Creator from their Community Members and, if you do not Opt-Out of Company Issued Refunds (as defined in Section 4.2.2(B) below), Company will also deduct (x) five percent (5%) of gross revenues as a reserve for refunds, and (y) will deduct any applicable refunds.\nCompany reserves the right to change the Locals Platform Fee at any time.</p>\n<p>(B) If payment processing is managed by Company without the use of third-party provider Stripe, you agree that payments shall be directly deposited to you by Company utilizing an automated clearing house (\u201cACH\u201d) or wire transfer.\nYou will be notified if this form of payment processing is selected by Company, at which time Company will request ACH or wire transfer information from you.\nPayments due to you will be calculated by Company at the end of each month and will include deductions for (i) the Locals Platform Fee (as defined in Section 4.2.1(A)(ii) above), (ii) any applicable Processing Fees (as defined in Section 4.2.1(A)(i) above), and, if you do not Opt-Out of Company Issued Refunds (as defined in Section 4.2.2(B) below), Company will also deduct (x) five percent (5%) of gross revenues as a reserve for refunds, and (y) will deduct any applicable refunds.\nPayments will be made to you in a timely manner.</p>\n<p>You can review all Processing Fees and the applicable Locals Platform Fee within the 'settings' section of your Account.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, we may hold or block certain payments in the event that these Terms (including any of our additional terms, guidelines, and rules) have been violated, for legal or tax compliance reasons (including if we suspect any fraudulent activity), or as otherwise required by Stripe, any other third-party service provider, or any applicable legal or regulatory authority.\nPlease contact Locals for more details.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.2.2 Refunds (other than for Locals Coins).</strong> The Company\u2019s default position is that it will issue a refund on your behalf for any reason when requested by a Community Member and Company will manage the refund process.\nYou have the option to Opt-Out of Company Issued Refunds, as described in more detail in sub-section (B) below.</p>\n<p>(A) If Company manages the refund process, the Company will issue the refund on your behalf.\nIf Company chooses to manage the refund process using Stripe, you hereby authorize Company to issue the refund via your Stripe account.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, if you do not Opt-Out of Company Issued Refunds, the deductions specified in Section 4.2.1(A)(x) and (y) and Section 4.2.1(B)(x) and (y) will be made by Company to any payments deposited to you in addition to deductions for the Locals Platform Fee and Processing Fees.\n(B) If you do not want Company to manage or issue refunds on your behalf, you must notify Company in writing that you Opt-Out of Company Issued Refunds, in which case you will manage and issue all refunds, if any, using your Stripe account.\nIf you Opt-Out of Company Issued Refunds, the deductions specified in Section 4.2.1(A)(x) and (y) and Section 4.2.1(B)(x) and (y) will not be made by Company to any payments deposited to you, but only deductions for the Locals Platform Fee and Processing Fees will be made.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.2.3 Refunds (for Locals Coins).</strong> Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, including Section 4.2.2 above, but in any case, subject to Section 5.7(B) and (C) below, Company always maintains the right to make refunds for Locals Coins.\nEven if Creator opts out of having Company issue refunds pursuant to Section 4.2.2(B) above, Creator will not have the ability to issue Locals Coins refunds.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.3.\nTaxes</strong>.\nWe do not manage, account for, or make any tax withholdings in connection with applicable federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, goods and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or charges, whether now in force or enacted in the future (collectively, \"<strong>Taxes</strong>\"), except that we may collect your tax identification information and report such information to the relevant tax authorities to the extent we are legally required to do so.\nTo the maximum extent permitted by law (unless explicitly stated otherwise), all Processing Fees and the Locals Platform Fee are exclusive of any Taxes.\nYou are responsible for payment of all Taxes relating to your use of the Site as a Creator.\nIf we are obligated to pay or collect any Taxes that you have paid or will pay based on your use of the Site as a Creator, you agree that you are ultimately responsible for such Taxes and that we may collect the payment amount for such Taxes from you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.4.\nOther Restrictions.</strong> You may not use the Site or offer any Benefits which in any manner

Protection.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Company may share relevant Community Member Data with Creator, as outlined in Company's Data Processing Agreement, for the purpose of enabling Creator to provide Benefits to its Community Members.</p>\n<p>Company and Creator acknowledge and agree that Creator\u2019s provision of Benefits to Community Members may extend outside of the Services provided by Company and may continue after Creator has ceased to use Company's Services.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, Creator agrees that it shall continue to abide by any applicable Data Protection Legislation following the expiration or termination of the Locals Policies and/or this Agreement as they apply to Members.</p>\n<p>Creator will not be required to delete or return to Company any Community Member Data in Creator\u2019s possession following the expiration or termination of the Locals Policies and/or this Agreement as they apply to Creator unless such deletion or return is required by applicable Data Protection Legislation.</p>\n<p>Company shall immediately inform Creator in writing if it becomes aware of a circumstance that would require the deletion or return of any Community Member Data.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.6 Community Moderation by Creator</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Creators in their sole determination may remove or modify any User Content, and/or request that Locals remove Community Members from their community.</p>\n<strong>5 .\nUsing the Site as a Community Member.</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>5.1.\nPaid Membership Subscriptions.</strong> The Site allows you to receive certain Benefits from specific Creators in exchange for becoming a Community Member of that Creator through paid membership subscriptions offered by the Creator, (each, a \"<strong>Paid Membership</strong>\").\nBy signing up for a Paid Membership, you agree to pay the specified subscription fees (collectively, <strong>\"Subscription Fees\"</strong>) associated with such Paid Membership as indicated on the Site.</p>\n<p>Such Subscription Fees may be collected and processed via Stripe (<strong>https://stripe.com</strong>) and/or PayPal (<strong>https://www.paypal.com</strong>) (collectively, our \" <strong>Billing Service Providers</strong>\"), which have their own legal terms.\nYou will be required to provide us and/or our Billing Service Provider with information regarding your credit card or other payment method.\nYou represent and warrant that such information is true and that you are authorized to use the payment method.\nDepending on the Paid Membership, there may be a one-time fee or recurring Subscription Fees.\nFor recurring Subscription Fees, we will bill or charge you in regular automatically-renewing intervals (such as monthly, annually, or biennially), on a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you can do at any time either through the Site or by contacting the relevant support team.</p>\n<p>Subscription Fees may also be paid for using Locals Coins at the rates set by Locals at the time of initial subscription and subscription renewal.</p>\n<p>Please also review our policy for in app purchases in Section 12 (\" <strong>Mobile Applications</strong>\") below.\nIn the event of any conflict between this Section 5.1 and Section 12, then Section 12 will prevail.\nYou acknowledge and agree that in certain situations you may lose access to the Benefits offered by a Creator, including without limitation in the case you cancel your Paid Membership, your payment method(s) fail, a Creator decides to block your Account, or a Creator decides to delete his or her own Account on the Site.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.2.\nTaxes.</strong> To the extent permitted by law, or unless explicitly stated otherwise, all Subscription Fees are exclusive of applicable Taxes (defined above).\nYou are responsible for payment of all applicable Taxes relating to your use of the Site, your payments, or your purchases.\nIf we are obligated to pay or collect Taxes on the Subscription Fees you've paid or will pay, you are responsible for such Taxes, and we may collect payment for such Taxes.\nfor example, if you are located in the EU we may add VAT to the total charges for Subscriptions Fees.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.3.\nPayment Failures.</strong> If your payment fails or if a Paid Membership is otherwise not paid for or paid for on time, the Creator may cancel or revoke your access to the Paid Membership through the Site.\nIf you contact your bank or credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of Subscription Fees for a Paid Membership, we may revoke your access to the Site in general.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.4.\nAutomatic Renewal.</strong> To ensure uninterrupted service, payments for any recurring Paid Memberships are automatically renewed.\nThis means that unless you cancel a Paid Membership before the end of the applicable subscription period, it will automatically renew, and you authorize us to invoice you or use any payment mechanism we have on record for you to collect the then-applicable Subscription Fees (as well as any Taxes).\nBy default, your Paid Memberships will be renewed for the same interval of time as your original subscription period.\nFor example, if you purchase a one month subscription, you will be charged for each monthly subscription period thereafter.\nWe may charge your account up to one month before the end of the subscription period.\nIt is your responsibility to make sure you are checking your email (including any spam or other filters) in order to receive any reminder email we send to you in advance of renewal.\nThe date for the automatic renewal may be determined automatically based on the date of the original purchase and in such event cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.5.\nCanceling Automatic Renewal.</strong> You can manage and cancel your subscription for any Paid Membership either through the Site (under 'manage subscription' within 'settings') or by contacting the relevant support team.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.6.\nFee Changes.</strong> Creators may change their Subscription Fees at any time, or start charging Subscription Fees for Benefits that were previously free.\nWhen applicable, Creators may give you advance notice of the Subscription Fee changes.\nIf you don't agree with the Subscription Fee changes, you must cancel your subscription to the Paid Membership or you will be charged in accordance with the new Subscription Fees.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.7.\nRefunds.</strong>\n<br>\nA) While you may cancel your Paid Memberships at any time, refunds are issued pursuant to Section 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 above, unless otherwise required by applicable law.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, if a Creator does not Opt-Out of Company Issued Refunds, refunds will be issued by the Company.\nIf a Creator does Opt-Out of Company Issued Refunds, refunds will be issued in the Creator\u2019s sole discretion.<br>\nB) Refunds for Coins purchases from the Locals website are issued by Company, unless otherwise required by applicable law.<br>\nC) Refunds for Coins purchases from the Locals App are subject to the terms contained in Section 12 below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.8.\nContent Plus.</strong>\n<br>\nWhen you purchase Content Plus (as defined in Section 13 below) you will have access to the Content Plus post as long as you have a Locals account and the Creator of the Content Plus continues to make their content available through Locals.</p>\n<strong>6 .\nIndemnification.</strong>\n<p>You agree to indemnify and hold Company (and its officers, employees, and agents) harmless, including costs and attorneys' fees, from

connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.\nUnless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English.\nThis Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(b) Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution</strong>.\nBefore either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute ( <strong>\"Notice\"</strong> ) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief.\nA Notice to the Company should be sent to: 444 Gulf of Mexico Dr, Longboat Key, FL 34228.\nAfter the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.\nIf you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding.\nThe amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(c) Arbitration Rules.</strong> Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association ( <strong>\"AAA\"</strong> ), an established alternative dispute resolution provider ( <strong>\"ADR Provider\"</strong> ) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section.\nIf AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider.\nThe rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms.\nThe AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules ( <strong>\"Arbitration Rules\"</strong> ) governing the arbitration are available online at <strong>www.adr.org</strong> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nThe arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.\nAny claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S.\nDollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.\nFor claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S.\nDollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules.\nAny hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise.\nIf you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings.\nAny judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nIf the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00.\nEach party shall bear its own costs (including attorney's fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(d) Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.</strong> If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions.\nthe specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.\nThe arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(e) Time Limits.</strong> If you or the Company pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(f) Authority of Arbitrator.</strong> If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.\nThe arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.\nThe arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms.\nThe arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.\nThe arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.\nThe award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(g) Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.\nArbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court.\nIn the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(h) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</strong> ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CREATOR OR MEMBER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CREATOR OR MEMBER.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(i) Confidentiality.</strong> All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential.\nThe parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law.\nThis paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(j) Miscellaneous.</strong> If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.\nAny or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted.\nSuch waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.\nThis Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration.\nA request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party's patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.\nIn any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Sarasota County, Florida, for such purpose, and waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections thereto.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.4.\nGoverning Law.\nExport.</strong> This
