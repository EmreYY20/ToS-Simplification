advertisements to consumers and generate statistics and metrics related to the delivery of interest-based advertisements.\nThey may utilize information collected through a variety of Data Technologies to provide customization, auditing, research and reporting for us, our affiliates and other advertisers.\nThis data collection takes place both on the Sites and on third-party\u2019s websites and

these purposes and give you the ability to opt-out of this use of your information.\nYou may see an icon in or around third-party advertisements on the Sites that use interest-based advertising programs and on pages where data is collected and used for online interest-based advertising.\nClicking on this icon will provide additional information about the companies and data practices that

decline cookies if you prefer.\nYou may also render some web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies and disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on\u2019s settings or opting out at Ghosteryenterprise.com or the website of the technology provider.\nIf you choose to decline cookies or similar technologies, however, please note that certain features on the Sites may not function properly or at all as a result.\nYou may be able to adjust the use of advertising identifiers on mobile devices through the settings on your
