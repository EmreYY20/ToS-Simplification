to you within the Services.\nDon\u2019t misuse our Services.\nFor example, don\u2019t interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide.\nYou may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations.\nWe may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.\n<br> Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access.\nYou may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law.\nThese terms do not grant you the right to use any

refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law.\nBut that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don\u2019t assume that we do.\nIn
