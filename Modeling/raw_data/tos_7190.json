appropriate consent by either a) choosing to act as the agent of the Parent and consent on the Parents behalf which is commonly referred to as School Consent or b) collect the parental consent directly from the parent.</p>\n<p>The first and simplest way is for teachers to agree to act as the parent's agent, and provide consent on their behalf to use Campus Suite solely in the educational context.\nThis form is commonly referred to as \"school consent\".\nUnder this type of consent, no Student PI or related content submitted by students will be shown publicly, unless parents give additional parental consent to School.\nTeachers, Staff or IT Administrators should not be publishing any Student PI without the appropriate parental consent.</p>\n&nbsp.\nTypes of Data

responsible for any third-party Personal Data obtained, published or shared through the platform and confirm that they have the third party's consent to provide the Data to the Owner.</p>\n<p>We outsource some development of our software to a trusted third party for the purpose of processing the contact information coming from a school\u2019s SIS and normalizing it into our system for email, text and voice communications.\nIn this case, we have a signed NDA in place that includes our expectations of data handling, security and privacy.</p>\n<p>Campus Suite allows end-users to change, at any time, email addresses and phone numbers that have been synchronized to us from the school.\nTo change this personal information, log into the parent portal, review the information, and make the appropriate changes.\nThis will result in an automatic notice sent to the school asking them to update the information in their SIS, Active Directory or system that is synchronizing data to us so that the proper contact information is correctly sent to us during the next synchronization.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nMode and place of processing the Data\nMethods of processing\n<p>The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of the Data.</p>\n<p>The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated.\nIn addition to the Owner, in some cases, the Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge,

IT companies, communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner.\nThe updated list of these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.</p>\n<p>If Campus Suite becomes aware of a systems security breach by an unauthorized party or that any user data was used for an unauthorized purpose, we will comply with relevant state and other data breach laws.\nWe will notify users of any breach resulting in unauthorized release of data electronically, at minimum, and without unreasonable delay so that you can take appropriate steps.\nThe notification will include: date of the breach, the types of information that were subject to the breach, general description of what occurred, and steps Campus Suite is taking to address the breach.</p>\n&nbsp.\nLegal basis of processing\n<p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes.\nNote: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (\u201copt-out\u201d), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal

with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;</li>\n<li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;</li>\n<li>processing is

whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>\n&nbsp.\nRequests to Review, Change or Remove Personal Data\n<p>Data is synchronized one-way from the school to Campus Suite in order for us to provide notifications services.\nAny party seeking access to their personal information stored by Campus Suite can make a request to the school sharing the data.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Campus Suite allows end-users to change, at any time, email addresses and phone numbers that have been synchronized to us from the school.\nTo change this personal information, log into the parent portal, review the information, and make the appropriate changes.\nThis will result in an automatic notice sent to the school asking them to update the information in their SIS, Active Directory or system that is synchronizing data to us so that the proper contact information is correctly sent to us during the next synchronization.</p>\n<p>Student information may be visible during Customer Support and/or Troubleshooting.\nPersonally identifiable information such as Student Name, Student Email Address, login dates and times could be viewed by our Product Support Staff.</p>\n<p>Educators can delete an account at your request by contacting them directly.\nWhen they delete your account, that information will not sync over during the next synchronization process, and the data in Campus Suite will be deleted.\nPlease note that some content may not be deleted given various compliance and recordkeeping obligations schools have.\nPlease contact your (or your child\u2019s) school if you would like this content deleted.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Below are some general user rights specified in the Campus Suite
