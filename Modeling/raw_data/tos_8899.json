Store.\nFees and Payments\n<p>Through the marketplace functionality within the Platform (the \"<strong>Store</strong>\"), Essential makes available certain first-party and third-party cosmetic modifications to the Minecraft\u00ae game (commonly referred to as \"cosmetics\") (\"<strong>Cosmetics</strong>\") for purchase by Users who are at least sixteen (16) years old.\nEach Cosmetic is considered Platform Content and accordingly owned by Essential and, when and as purchased by a User through the Store, licensed to that User in accordance with the terms of the Platform License.</p>\n<p>All Cosmetics are virtual and have no value, and cannot be exchanged for real-world currency of any kind.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, Essential's provision of the Store and sale of Cosmetics are subject to the terms and conditions of the Disclaimers section below, including that the Store and Cosmetics are provided to Users on an \"as is\" basis without express or implied warranties of any kind and that access to the Store and Cosmetics are not guaranteed to be uninterrupted or themselves error-free.\nIf Essential no longer operates or maintains the Platform, the Store, and/or any Cosmetics, then the Cosmetics that a User has purchased through the Store may no longer be operational or serve their intended purpose at the time of purchase and may ultimately be forfeited or lost.</p>\n<p>To purchase a Cosmetic through the Store, a User is required to establish an Account and shall pay all fees and charges, including all applicable taxes (including sales and use taxes and VAT), incurred through its Account at the price then-advertised on the listing for such Cosmetic in the Store (which may vary from time to time) when and as charged to the User or its Account by Essential's third-party payment processor, Tebex Limited (the \"<strong>Payment Processor</strong>\"), which facilitates all Store transactions through its checkout platform located at https://checkout.tebex.io/.\nThe Payment Processor will detail accepted methods of payment, delivery times, fees and charges (including additional fees associated with, among other things, currency conversions, gateway fees, originator fees), and applicable taxes as part of the checkout process and, when you provide payment information to the Payment Processor, you represent and warrant that you are the authorized user of that method of payment (e.g., a credit card) and authorize the Payment Processor to charge such method of payment.\nThe Payment Processor has complete control over transactions made through the Store and may decline any transaction for any reason it sees fit, including, but not limited to, potential fraudulent activity or your previous interactions with the Payment Processor.\nThe payment information you submit when making a transaction through the Store will be collected and used by the Payment Process in accordance with its privacy polices and as further described in the Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>All transactions made through the Store are final.\nRefunds are solely at Essential and the Payment Processor's discretion.\nRefunds will not be issued to any User whose access to the Platform is denied, suspended, or terminated due to a breach of these Terms of Use or any policies of the Payment Processor.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Users who are citizens or residents of the European Economic Area (the \"<strong>EU Users</strong>\") and who make purchases through the Store have the legal right of withdrawal on software sales, though content provided digitally, such as a Cosmetic, is excluded from this right once the content is provided to the end-user purchaser.\nThis statutory right of withdrawal ends fourteen (14) days after such EU User purchases or, where the EU User has provided the appropriate consent and acknowledgement, the moment such EU User starts downloading the content and services for the first time, whichever is sooner.\nThe statutory right of withdrawal is not applicable as regards the supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium if the performance has begun with the EU User's prior express consent and its acknowledgment that the EU User thereby loses its right of withdrawal.\nTo exercise the right of withdrawal, an EU User must inform the Payment Processor of its decision in writing by email at https://www.tebex.io/contact/checkout to withdraw from the purchase by an unequivocal statement before the withdrawal period has expired.\nIf an EU User exercises its right of withdrawal, the Payment Processor will reimburse to such EU User all payments received from that EU User without undue delay and in any event not later than fourteen (14) days from the day on which the EU User provides such withdrawal notice to the Payment Processor.\nThe Payment Processor will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as the EU User used for the initial transaction, unless it has expressly agreed otherwise.\nin any event, the EU User will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p>\n<p>If you require assistance processing a transaction through the Store, need to report fraudulent activity, or have any other questions or concerns, contact the Payment Processor at https://www.tebex.io/contact/checkout.\nEssential will not be able to provide any customer support or technical assistance.</p>\n<p>To the extent any portions of the Platform or the Platform as a whole requires a subscription agreement and/or a prepaid fee, which may be modified from time to time in Essential's sole discretion, such prepaid fee, and all taxes and other fees related thereto, will be paid by each User in advance and in no event will a User be allowed access to the relevant portion of the Platform or Content for which a prepaid fee is required unless and until Essential receives all fees and charges payable by such User.</p>\nAdvertisers on Platform\n<p>The Platform may contain advertising and sponsorship or sponsored Content.\nAdvertisers and sponsors are responsible for ensuring that Content submitted for inclusion on the Platform is accurate and complies with applicable laws.\nEssential will not be responsible for the illegality of or any error or inaccuracy in advertisers' or sponsors' Content or for the acts or omissions of advertisers and sponsors.</p>\nSpecial Promotions\n<p>Essential may from time to time offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions to Users through the Platform (each, a \"<strong>Promotion</strong>\"), including those that may require an Account.\nAll Promotions will be run at the sole discretion of Essential, and can be activated, modified, or removed at any time by Essential without advance notification and the liability of any of Essential's partners in such Promotions.\nBy participating in any Promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, Minecraft UUID, voice, likeness, or other indicia of persona in advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion.\nIf you choose to enter a Promotion, your personal information may be disclosed to third-party Persons or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion as further described in the Privacy Policy, including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion's official rules, such as on a winner's list.</p>\nCommunications from Essential\n<p>By using the Platform, you hereby affirmatively consent to receiving notifications from Essential regarding important service announcements and other administrative communications related to your use of the Platform, as well as certain marketing and other advertising communications from Essential and from Essential's third-party advertising partners, as more fully set forth in the Privacy Policy.\nYou will be able to opt out of receipt of certain notifications by following the instructions described in the Privacy Policy.\nhowever, if you do not wish to receive certain service and other administrative notifications related to the Platform, your only way to opt out of such messages is to stop using the Platform.</p>\nThird-Party Communications\n<p>Essential disclaims all liability for any communications directed to you from any third-party Person, directly or indirectly, in connection with the Platform (\"<strong>Third-Party Communications</strong>\") that you may receive and any actions you may take or refrain from taking because of any Third-Party Communications.\nYou are solely responsible for assessing and verifying the identity and trustworthiness of the source and content of any Third-Party Communications.\nEssential assumes no
