your password.\n</li>\n<li> Mobicip does not allow minor children to subscribe to Mobicip.\nHowever, as part of your Parent account, you may choose to provide personally identifiable data about yourself and your family members, for instance a photograph, age, and name for each child.\nYou acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and that setting up the personal information in your account potentially allows Mobicip to identify you or your family members, and therefore may not be anonymous.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> Third-Party Payment Processor <ul>\n<li> Mobicip

personal information is governed by Stripe\u2019s privacy policy, which may be reviewed at https://stripe.com/us/privacy.\nApple\u2019s collection and use of your personal information is governed by

to assist in performing certain general business functions.\nExamples include payment processing, sending transactional and bulk email, providing marketing assistance, and providing technical support.\nThese services only have access to personal information needed to perform their respective functions, but may not use it for other purposes.\nFor instance, no Child data or usage data is shared whatsoever.\nFurther, each service must process the personal information in strict accordance with its own Privacy Policy, which is of course whetted by Mobicip to be compliant with industry standards.\nWe will never voluntarily sell personally identifiable data with any third party without the user's express consent or unless compelled by applicable state and federal laws.\nIf the company gets acquired, personal data may be included in the acquisition.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> Website Traffic Patterns <ul>\n<li> We track aggregate traffic patterns throughout our web
