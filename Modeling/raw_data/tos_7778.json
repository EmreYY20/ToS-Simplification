Basics</u>\n<p> Below is a quick overview of how the Rewards Program works: <br>\n<br> SUMMARY OF REWARD PROGRAM PURCHASE REQUIREMENTS.\nTo claim your Reward you must earn one hundred (100) points as follows: (a) earn fifteen (15) points for completing your registration (by providing your email, first/last name, phone number, postal address, gender and date of birth).\n(b) earn twenty-five (25) points for completing the initial survey.\n(c) earn twenty (20) points for viewing the offers.\nand (d) earn the final forty (40) points for completing the requisite number of Reward Program Offers (ten (10) points for completing two (2) Bronze Offers, ten (10) points for completing two (2) Silver Offers and twenty (20) points for completing six (6) Gold Offers).\nYou must complete all Reward Program Offers within thirty (30) days from when you complete your first offer.\nCompletion of Reward Program Offers will require a purchase or entering into a paid subscription program.\nand credit card offers may also require you to activate the card by making a purchase, transferring a balance and/or taking a cash advance.\nLimit of one (1) Reward per household.\nVoid where prohibited.\nCOMPLETING A SURVEY AND/OR VIEWING THE OFFERS WITHOUT COMPLETING THE REQUISITE NUMBER OF REWARD PROGRAM OFFERS FROM THE SPECIFIED CATEGORIES ABOVE DOES NOT QUALIFY YOU FOR A REWARD.\n<br>\n<br> Please note that the Bronze, Silver and Gold Offers appear AFTER the registration forms, surveys and optional offers which do NOT count towards earning your Reward.\nYou will be credited for having completed an offer only if you access it by clicking on a hyperlink made available on the Website.\nIf you do not complete all of the required offers in one (1) session, you must click on the <strong>\n<u>Check Reward Status</u>\n</strong> hyperlink to resume your fulfillment of the Promotions requirements.\nand then enter the e-mail address that you used to register your Account (as defined below) on the Website (which will enable you to resume signing up for offers).\nYou cannot sign up for the same offer more than once and get credit towards earning your Reward for any duplicated offer completion.\n<br>\n<br> You cannot: (a) complete Offers using a bot or other automated means of sign-up.\n(b) otherwise tamper with our system or attempt to defraud us by using multiple email addresses or other means.\nor (c) otherwise \"game\" the Reward Program to circumvent the limitations described herein.\nMoreover, you cannot use a link to the Website provided by another person, or one otherwise obtained outside of our normal marketing channels such as a YouTube video or gaming site or blog, or reuse a link that you previously used to claim a Reward.\nWe may also disqualify you in our sole discretion if we believe that you accessed the Website \"mid-path\" by skipping the registration and/or survey pages.\nIf we reasonably believe you are attempting to do so, we reserve the right to void all of your attempts to qualify for a Reward with or without notice.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>Introduction and Overview</u>\n<p> These Consumerdigitalsurvey and Consumer
