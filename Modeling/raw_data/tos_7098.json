us.</p>\n<p>It is TopLogger's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.\nAccordingly, we have developed this privacy policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate, disclose and otherwise make use of personal information.\nWe have outlined our privacy policy below.</p>Website Visitors<p>Like most website operators, TopLogger.nu collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.\nTopLogger.nu\u2019s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how TopLogger.nu\u2019s visitors use its website.\nFrom time to time, TopLogger.nu may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>\n<p>TopLogger.nu also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.\nTopLogger.nu does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information<p>Certain visitors to TopLogger.nu choose to interact with TopLogger.nu in ways that require TopLogger.nu to gather personally-identifying information.\nThe amount and type of information that TopLogger.nu gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.\nFor example, we ask users to provide a username and email address.\nIn each case, TopLogger.nu collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor\u2019s interaction with TopLogger.nu.\nTopLogger.nu does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.\nAnd visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>Aggregated Statistics<p>TopLogger.nu may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites.\nHowever, TopLogger.nu does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information<p>TopLogger.nu discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on TopLogger.nu\u2019s behalf or to provide services available at TopLogger.nu, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.\nSome of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country.\nby using TopLogger.nu, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.\nTopLogger.nu will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.\nOther than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, TopLogger.nu discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when TopLogger.nu believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of TopLogger.nu, third parties, or the public at large.\nIf you are a registered user of the TopLogger.nu website and have supplied your email address, TopLogger.nu may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what\u2019s going on with TopLogger.nu and our products.\nIf you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.\nTopLogger.nu takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>Cookies<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor\u2019s computer, and that the visitor\u2019s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.\nTopLogger.nu uses cookies to help TopLogger.nu identify and track visitors, their usage of TopLogger.nu, and their website access preferences.\nTopLogger.nu visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using TopLogger.nu\u2019s websites, with the drawback that certain features of TopLogger.nu\u2019s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>Data deletion<p>You can request the removal of your user data by sending an email to privacy@toplogger.nu.\nMake sure to send the email from the email address associated with the TopLogger account to be deleted.\n</p>Privacy Policy Changes<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, TopLogger.nu may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in TopLogger.nu\u2019s sole discretion.\nTopLogger.nu encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.\nYour continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>",
