locator forms to board their flight.\nIn addition to the above you can also choose to upload your Digital Covid Cert to your mobile phone during online check-in, in which case it will be saved for future bookings on your mobile phone, and you may remove this document at any time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When you have a specific medical condition, you need to inform us of that and in some instances

your data <p>We will not retain your data for longer than is necessary to fulfil the purpose it is being processed for.\nWe must also consider periods for which we need to retain personal data in order to meet our legal obligations (e.g., in relation to claims for cancelled flights under EU261) or to deal with complaints, queries, regulatory requirements, for audit purposes, to demonstrate compliance with public health regulations and relevant entry requirements and to protect our legal rights in the event of a claim being made.&nbsp;To determine the appropriate retention period, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the purposes for which we process it and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.\nWe will also consider if and how we can minimise over time the personal data that we use, and if we can anonymise your personal data so that it can no longer be associated with you or identify you, in which case we may use that information without further notice to you.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Booking Data is archived 18 months from the date of the flight, once there are no outstanding refunds or money due.\nIn general, most Booking Data is deleted 7 years after the date of the flight.\nOnce this information is archived all payment and travel document information is obscured.\nOnly limited roles within Ryanair have access to this

retained in our systems as described above.\nYou can change the personal data in your myRyanair account directly in the account.\nAny changes made by you will only apply to bookings made after these changes were made and will not alter existing bookings.</p>\n<p>We process data subject requests using a specialised data protection tool provided by &nbsp;OneTrust.\nAccess to this system is restricted to a limited number of roles in Ryanair and data held in OneTrust is encrypted.\nWe separately keep a log of erasure requests made through our online form, for one year.</p>\n<p>We use a third party tool called Zendesk to manage customer service interactions, including complaints, chats, refund requests, EU261 claims, serious illness claims and mishandled baggage claims.\nThis data is retained for a period that reflects the statute of limitations period for contract claims which is at most 10 years.</p> Security of your personal data <p>We are committed to ensuring the security and confidentiality of your personal data.\nTaking into account the nature of your personal data and the risks of processing, we have put in place appropriate technical and organizational measures as required by applicable legal provisions to ensure an appropriate level of security and to prevent any accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure, intrusion of or unauthorized access to these data.</p>\n<p>All payment details are transmitted and stored in compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS).</p>\n<p>We may disclose your information to trusted third parties for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.\nWe require all third parties to have appropriate technical and operational security measures in place to protect your personal

Protection Officer (\u201c<b>DPO</b>\u201d) to oversee compliance with this policy.\nIn addition, you always have the right to make a complaint at any time to a supervisory authority.\nThe Irish Data Protection Commission is the lead data protection supervisory authority for Ryanair DAC so please be aware that your complaint may be transferred to the Irish Data Protection Commission.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Your Data Protection Rights <p>The GDPR and other data protection laws give you specific rights in relation to your personal information.\nDetails of these rights and how to exercise them are set out below.</p>\n<p>\n<b>DATA RIGHTS</b>\n</p>\n<p>Your rights include the following:</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<b>Opt out / Unsubscribe</b>.\nYou can request to be removed from our marketing mailing list by clicking here.\nThis requires verification of your email address.\nPlease follow the instructions provided through the link.</p>\n<p>Please note that if you opt out of marketing communications you will still receive service communications in relation to existing bookings.\nThese can include information about the services you may be using (e.g., seat reservation, checked baggage, etc.).</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<b>Request for erasure of your personal information (right to be forgotten).\n</b>You may ask us to delete or remove personal data, where we have no legal basis to continue to process it.\nThis includes deletion of the myRyanair account linked to the email address provided and/or used in booking a flight.\nHowever, we will retain the personal data that relates to a contract between you and Ryanair (flight booking) to perform the contract, defend or pursue our legal rights and meet our obligations towards regulatory or governmental authorities.</p>\n<p>You can request erasure by clicking here.&nbsp.\nThis requires verification of your email address.\nPlease follow the instructions provided through the link.</p>\n<p>Please note we will make every effort to erase data where this right has been exercised by you and we no longer have a legal basis for processing same but some personal data sets are impossible (or infeasible) to edit or remove (e.g., server backup or microfiche).</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<b>Object to processing.</b> You have the right to object to the use of your data for direct marketing purposes at any time through this form.\nThis will remove you from our marketing databases.\nIt requires verification of your email address.\nPlease follow the instructions provided through the link.&nbsp.\nYou may also request us to stop processing your personal data where we are doing so based on legitimate interests (e.g., address personalized offers to you in the booking process) unless we require your data for dealing with legal claims or we have compelling legitimate grounds which override your rights.\nIf this is the basis for your objection, then click here&nbsp;for our online request form and set out in the comment area your basis for objection.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<b>Request information.\n</b>The section on \u2018What personal data we collect\u2019 sets out what personal data we collect and the section \u2018What we use your personal data for\u2019 sets out the reasons we collect it.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<b>Request access </b>to the personal data we hold about you.\nIf you have a myRyanair account, you can view the personal data held in this account by logging into your account.\nIf you wish to access other personal data we hold about you other than what is in your myRyanair account, then you can use our webform available here.\nYou will need to provide a copy of your photo ID, either passport or national ID, when making your request so we can verify your identity.\nWe may not be able to provide you access to the data when it involves information relating to others who have not consented to the disclosure of their information.\nWe will also have to verify your email address before we can send the data to the email address provided in the request.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<b>Request correction </b>of the personal information that we hold about you.\nThis can be done by you through your myRyanair account.\n&nbsp;We have included tools in your myRyanair account, allowing you to directly change personal data you have provided there.</p>\n<p>Please note that if you require changes in active bookings (i.e., where the flight has not yet taken place), you need to contact our Customer Services directly, as set out in our General Terms and Conditions of Carriage and FAQs.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<b>Object to automated decision-making including profiling</b>, which produce a legal effect or similarly significant effects.\nWe do use personal data to personalize the services and offers you receive.\nWe also use automated processes to assist us in determining where additional in-person travel document checks are required.\nWe do not engage in automated processing with legal or similarly significant effects.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<b>Request the restriction of processing </b>of your personal information.\nThis enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, but only in limited circumstances, which you must set out in the <u>comment section</u> of our webform.\nClick here</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<b>Request portability </b>of your personal information in an electronic and structured form to you or to another party (commonly known as a right to \u201cdata portability\u201d).\nThis enables you to take your data from us in an electronically useable format and to be able to transfer your data to another party in an electronically useable format.\nClick here</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<b>Withdraw consent.</b> In the limited circumstances where you may have provided your consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your personal information for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time.\nIn relation to marketing communications, this can be done as set out above under opt out / unsubscribe.\nIn your myRyanair account this can be done through your account by using the delete buttons provided where consent is the basis for our processing.\nOnce we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have another legitimate basis for doing so in law.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<b>Third parties.&nbsp;</b>If you are applying on behalf of another person then we require a signed letter of authority from the data subject in the form provided&nbsp;here.&nbsp.\nIf you are applying as a parent/guardian of children then we require the signed letter of authority provided&nbsp;here.&nbsp;In addition to the other requirements set out below, we will also verify the email of the data subject before processing such requests.&nbsp;If you wish to make a request on behalf of someone else, please use our third party&nbsp;webform, which allows for attachment of 1) required documents to allow us to validate the identity of the data subject and 2) the above signed letter of authority from the person making the request on behalf of a data subject.</p>\n<p>We will respond to any request you make to exercise your rights within one month.\nHowever, where required for complex or numerous requests, we may notify you (within the initial one month period) that a further period of up to two months is required in order to respond to the request.</p>\n<p>These requests cannot be processed if made via email, due to their volume and the need to verify your identity before we can act on your request.\nThis is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.</p>\n<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights).\nHowever, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive.\nAlternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.</p> Changes to Privacy Policy <p>We may make changes to this privacy policy at any time and if we make any material changes we will bring these changes to your attention.&nbsp;</p> Contact Us <p>If you have any further questions about this policy or how we handle your personal information, which are not dealt with here or through our webform or through your myRyanair account, please get in touch
