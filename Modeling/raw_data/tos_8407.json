SecureWiFiWorks.com is a division of BlueAlly, Inc.\n<p>\n<strong>READ CAREFULLY.</strong> This Privacy Policy applies to use of the SecureWiFiWorks.com website located at http://www.securewifiworks.com/ (the \"Site\").\nThe Site is the property of BlueAlly, Inc.</p>\n<p>Our website allows you to buy products and services, apply for credit and receive newsletters, e-mails or other promotional information from us.\nWe use the information that we collect about you to fulfill your product and service purchases and to create a more personalized online experience.\nThis is just a brief overview, so please read on for more details about our Privacy Policy.\nThis Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.\n<u>Except as limited below, we reserve the right to use or disclose your personally identifiable information for business reasons in whatever manner desired.\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>Except as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you online.\nFor some services, we either collect and transfer personal information to a service provider you have selected, or you may visit other merchants through links on our site who may collect and use your personal information.\nIn those cases the third-party service provider or merchant's privacy policy will govern how your information is handled.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>1.\nWhat information do we collect from you?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In order to better provide you with numerous products and services, BlueAlly, Inc collects two types of information about its visitors: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.\nOur primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our site.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Personally Identifiable Information:</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are.\nPersonal information is requested when you order a product or service.\nFor example, this information might include your name, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other payment information, and product details.\nWith this information, BlueAlly, Inc can fill your orders and better provide you with personalized services.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual.\nWe gather certain information about you based upon where you shop on our site in several ways.\nThis information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis.\nFor example, this information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator (\"URL\") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address.\nA URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web.\nAn IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (\"TCP/IP\") network, such as the World Wide Web.\nNetworks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination.\nIn other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer.\nComputers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.</p>\n<p>On an aggregated basis, we collect anonymous data related to the pages, products, downloads and other content that is sampled, clicked on, streamed, searched for, transferred from and downloaded.\nExcept as otherwise limited in this Policy, we may disclose, sell, trade, or rent Non-Personally Identifiable Information to others without your consent.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nWhere do we collect information from you and how do we use it?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide BlueAlly, Inc\u2019s visitors with a superior customized online experience.\nWe use the customer contact information to fill orders, contact purchasers to inform them of their order status, to send promotional information, to enhance the operation of our site and administer our systems.</p>\n<p>Demographic data also may be collected at our site from third party advertising servers, content servers, or web site analysis agents who provide us with the zip code and area code associated with a visitor's server, along with pages viewed on our site.\nWe review the actions of the BlueAlly, Inc visitors on an aggregate basis to determine customers' preferences.\nBlueAlly, Inc also does research on our visitors' demographics, interests, and pages viewed based on the information provided to us during ordering, a promotion, from our server log files, from our web site analysis agents, or from contests, drawings or surveys.\nWe will use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site use, to improve our product offerings, and to customize our site's content, layout, and services.\nWe receive reports from third party ad servers, content servers, or web site analysis agents that tells us how many ads were presented and clicked upon or what content was served or viewed.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Ordering:</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>When you order from us, we collect personally identifiable information from you.\nIf you order one of our products or services, we will collect and maintain your name, e-mail address, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, product selections, credit card or other payment information, order number, referring URL, IP address, page you bought from and a password.\nWe collect this, and other information, as disclosed in this Policy, in order to fill your order, to communicate with you about your order and to send you promotional materials.\nBefore confirming your order, you will have the opportunity to review the product order form and make changes and additions to the information it contained and these changes will be automatically kept for future use.\nWe may require additional verifications or information before accepting any order.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Newsletters, Promotional E-mails and Personalized On-line Ads:</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>We offer free newsletters, promotional e-mails and personalized on-line advertisements as a service to our customers.\nWe will send you newsletters and e-mails periodically listing current specials and deals.\nYou may \"opt-out,\" or unsubscribe from our newsletters, emails or personalized on-line advertisements by following any unsubscribe instructions in any e-mail, newsletter or personalized on-line advertisement you receive from us.\nAfter doing so, if you have opted out of receiving all newsletters, all promotional emails or all personalized on-line ads, you will not receive future promotional emails, newsletters or personalized on-line advertisements (as applicable), unless you open a new account, enter a contest, or otherwise subsequently sign up to receive newsletters, emails or personalized on-line advertisements.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\nWith whom do we share your information?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Fulfillment:</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>The information collected by BlueAlly, Inc is used for processing orders, keeping you informed about your order status, for statistical purposes, for improving our site and its performance, to serve ads, and to notify you of products or special offers that may be of interest to you.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Other Parties Generally:</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>We may provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information about our customers' sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to third parties, but these statistics do not include any Personally Identifiable Information.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Products Advertised on Our Site:</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>Where you order or sign up for goods or services offered through our site, but sold directly to you by a third party or fulfilled by a third party, we give your personal information to that third party to facilitate the sale of such goods or services (e.g.\n, orders shipped from distribution or direct from the manufacturer).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nWhat security precautions are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions and order fulfillment are handled by established third party banking, processing agents and distribution institutions.\nThey receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process and ship your order.</p>\n<p>Within BlueAlly, Inc, your information is kept on password protected, limited access servers.\nWherever possible and applicable, BlueAlly, Inc servers reside behind a corporate firewall that maintains controls on access to the system from both our internal network and the Internet.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.\nContacting BlueAlly, Inc about privacy questions or concerns</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this site, please contact BlueAlly, Inc by sending a letter to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Attn: Privacy Policy<br> BlueAlly, Inc<br> 1225 Crescent Green, St.\n115 <br> Cary, NC 27518</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nPrivacy Policy changes</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy was last changed on February 1, 2015.\nIf BlueAlly, Inc makes changes to any terms or conditions of the Privacy Policy, the changes will be posted in this document so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and to whom we will disclose it.\nWe may change, modify, add or remove portions of this Policy

purchasing your new product.\nQualified customers will have the ability to lease their purchase with convenient and powerful financing options.\nYou are provided with the flexibility, quick response, and simplicity you need with quality customer service during your financing term.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Why Should I consider Leasing? Advantages of Leasing:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Leasing provides total financing.</strong> Generally no down payments are required, and lessees pay no extraneous tax, delivery, warranty, or other miscellaneous costs.\nAll costs associated with a purchase can be included in the lease, including delivery and installation.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Leasing conserves working capital.</strong> Leasing leaves lines of credit at other financial institutions free for cash-flow purposes, investments, unsecured loans, or unexpected emergencies.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Leasing overcomes budget limitations.</strong> Most companies are hampered by capital budget limitations from time to time.\nLeasing allows businesses to acquire new equipment with easily affordable rental payments.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Leasing provides security against equipment obsolescence.</strong> Upgrade and trade-in options can easily be added to a lease agreement.\nIn addition, there are no risks of equipment ownership, and lessees will never be required to resell or remarket obsolete equipment.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Leasing can offer tax savings.</strong> When properly structured, monthly lease payments may be fully tax deductible as an operating expense.\nThis savings results in a lower after-tax equipment cost.\nContact us to discuss tax advantages applicable to your specific situation.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Payments are a fixed cost.</strong> Monthly lease payments remain the same for the life of the lease, even if interest rates do not.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Leasing provides a faster return on investment.</strong> Revenues or savings created as a result of the equipment during the first month often will be in excess of the monthly lease payment, thereby providing an immediate return on investment.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>It is important to note that the common thread in each of these benefits is flexibility.</strong> Lease payments and terms may be structured based on a businesses particular need.\nEquipment leasing can be an extremely valuable financial tool for growing businesses while staying competitive in today's marketplace.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A minimum total purchase value is required for leasing options.\nNot all customers will qualify for the leasing program.\nPlease contact us to see if you qualify for our leasing program.\n<strong>Please Note: All Leasing options are provided by third party equipment leasing companies.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.\nPromotions, Promotional Gifts.</strong> Promotional items include any free items/gifts you receive with your order.\nPromotional items are only available on certain items, where stated.\nPromotions may be changed or revoked at any time.\nPromotional items may be shipped separately from your order via a different carrier and/or different service.\nPromotional items must be returned if you are returning your order (see return/exchange policy above).\nPromotional items may not be offered in the case of a quoted discount price or where a cash discount is provided.\nUnless otherwise stated, all promotional items are only available at the website price.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.\nOrder Acceptance Policy.</strong> Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell.\nBlueAlly, Inc reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason.\nBlueAlly, Inc further reserves the right any time after receipt of your order, without prior notice to you, to supply less than the quantity you ordered of any item.\nYour order will be deemed accepted by BlueAlly, Inc upon shipment of products or performance of services that you have ordered, or upon the completion of the license and delivery of a Digital Download, as indicated by our servers.\nTitle to goods and all risk of loss passes to you upon delivery to the
