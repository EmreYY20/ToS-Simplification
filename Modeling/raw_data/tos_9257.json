Yes.</p>\n<p>At its simplest you can do:</p>\n<code>$ curl ip.wtf\n5.75.154.116\n</code>\n<p>To get the IP address you're connecting from.\nthe API detects access from curl\nand automatically defaults to just the text version.</p>\n<p>In code add a header <code>Accept: text/plain</code> to get the plain text version.\nYou\ncan also use <code>application/json</code> to get a bit more information.</p>\n<p>JavaScript example:</p>\n<code>let res = await fetch(\"https://ip.wtf\", { headers: { Accept: \"application/json\" } }).\nlet data = await res.json().\nconsole.log(data).\n</code>\n<p>Which gives you:</p>\n<code>{ \"ip\": \"5.75.154.116\", \"location\": { \"continent\": \"EU\", \"continent_name\": \"Europe\", \"country\": \"DE\", \"country_name\": \"Germany\", \"region\": \"\", \"region_name\": \"\", \"city\": \"\", \"latitude\": 51.2993, \"longitude\": 9.491, \"accuracy_radius\": 0, \"timezone\": { \"name\": \"Europe/Berlin\", \"offset\": 0 } }, \"as\": { \"number\": 24940, \"name\": \"Hetzner Online GmbH\" }\n}</code>\n<p>If you use the hostname <code>ip.wtf</code> the client (browser or other HTTP client) will\npick the IP protocol to use.\nYou can also use the hostnames <code>v4.ip.wtf</code> or\n<code>v6.ip.wtf</code> to force a particular protocol, or otherwise ask the client to pick\nthe relevant protocol.</p>\n<p>For example with curl you can do:</p>\n<code>$ curl -4 ip.wtf\n$ curl -6 ip.wtf\n</code>\n<p>Access works over http or https.\nAPI access from a non-browser is never\nredirected to HTTPS (browsers may choose to use HTTPS though).\nIf you want to\nforce HTTP you can use the hostnames <code>nossl.ip.wtf</code> or <code>neverssl.ip.wtf</code>.\n(You\ncan also use those hostnames manually in a similar way to\nneverssl.com.)</p>\n<p>Reasonable use is fine (i.e.\n1 req/hour per source IP and not in something that\nis widely deployed).\nIf you need more contact us first, we reserve the right to\nblock unreasonable access otherwise.</p>\nFun\n<p>For a little easter egg try: <code>curl ip.wtf/moo</code>\n</p>\n<p>There's a small collection of fun things, which is slowly growing into a set of\ndemos.\nsee ip.wtf/fun.</p>\nPrivacy\n<p>This site collects data about your device and connection to the site in order\nto implement its primary purpose of showing you this information.</p>\n<p>The information displayed includes your IP address and hostname.</p>\n<p>Depending on your configuration some of the tests performed by this site may\nreveal a different IP address.\nthis data is only aggregated client side and\nnever stored on a server.</p>\n<p>In order to look up your hostname a reverse DNS lookup is performed, this uses\na third party DNS provider (Google Public DNS, see\nprivacy).</p>\n<p>Any information collected that identifies your IP address is not stored for\nlonger than one day, unless necessary to prevent abuse of the site, or if you\notherwise share the data with us (e.g.\nsend us an email, Twitter, etc).</p>\n<p>This site does not use cookies, or store data on your device.</p>\n<p>This product includes GeoLite2 data created by MaxMind, available from\nhttps://www.maxmind.com.</p>\nSponsor\n<p>If you like this, you can say thank you:\nko-fi.com/webgl.</p>\nContact\n<p>You can find us on Twitter or you can email us\nhere (click twice due to abuse prevention measures).</p>\n<p>Contact us</p>\n.\n", "created_at": "2023-07-27 21:31:52.431339", "updated_at": "2023-07-27 21:32:07.181828"}], "points": [], "urls": ["ip.wtf"]}}
