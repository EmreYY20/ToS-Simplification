about you: \u201cIdentifying Data\u201d (personal data) and \u201cNon Identifying Data\u201d.</p>\n<p>Identifying Data means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified.\nIt does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).\nIt refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are.</p>\n<p>We generally collect information in three ways: (A) you voluntarily provide information to us, such as by signing up for newsletter, (B) we collect information automatically from your use of the Services, such as through cookies or our games and other software, and (C) other parties, such as game console platforms and social networks, may provide information to us.\nEach of these methods is described in more detail below.</p>\n<i>(A) Information you provide</i>\n<p>We collect personal data about you when you voluntarily provide it to us.\nYou provide certain personal data (mostly identity data such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), e-mail address, job title and department, telephone and facsimile numbers and all personal data you choose to share) to us when you (a) sign up to a newsletter.\n(b) contact us about consumer comments or complaints.\n(c) contact our customer service or technical support.\n(d) send e-mail messages, submit forms, or transmit other information by telephone or letter.\nor (e) post any content/comment on RYSEUP\u2019s social networks.\nIn addition of identity data we may collect demographic information such as your age, gender, favorite styles of gaming and the device you own.</p>\n<i>(B) Information we collect automatically</i>\n<p>We also collect certain other technical data (some of which is personal data) when you use our Services.\nWe typically aggregate this data and use it in statistical form to determine trends among groups of users, rather than using it to identify individuals.&nbsp;If a combination of information that we collect does identify you as an individual, we will treat the combined information as personal data.</p>\n<p>We collect information automatically through technologies such as web browsers, cookies, web beacons, etc.\nWe use the information for purposes such as modifying or improving features, managing advertising, addressing technical issues, preventing misuse of our services, and conducting data analytics.\nThe type of information that we automatically collect may vary, but generally includes (a) technical information about your computer, device, hardware, or software you use to access the Internet or our services, such as IP address or identifier information for your device (such as device make and model, information about device operating systems and browsers, or other device or system related specifications).\n(b) usage information and statistics about your interaction with the Services, which may include the URLs of our website that you have visited, URLs of referring and exiting pages, page views, time spent on a page, number of clicks, platform type, the application you used or the game you played, how long you used or played it and when, and other usage statistics.\n(c) crash reports, which may be automatically generated when a game or application crashes and includes information about your system and the crash.\n(d) information that facilitates a safer and more personalized experience, such as user identification provided in connection with your application use or game play, saved preferences, game progress, and device identifiers or usage information for authentication and fraud prevention purposes .\nand (e) the location of your device, such as may be derived from your device\u2019s IP address.</p> Cookies <p>Cookies are a feature of your web browser that allows websites to transfer bits of information to your computer for record-keeping purposes.\nA cookie stored on your computer can be used to \u201cremember\u201d things like that you have already registered.\nThis allows us to speed up your future activities, saving the time you would normally spend entering information.\nIn addition, RYSEUP may use cookies to retrieve user information for promotional, marketing, or security purposes.\nTo find out more on the content of cookies and know how to exercise your rights relating to cookies, please refer to Section 5.</p> Internet protocol addresses <p>An Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\u201cISP\u201d).\nRYSEUP may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.</p> Log files <p>RYSEUP may collect information in the form of logs: files that record website activity and gather statistics about web users\u2019 browsing habits.\nFor most websites, these entries are generated anonymously, and help RYSEUP determine (among other things) how many and how often users visit our website, which pages they visit, and other similar navigational data.\nHowever, certain log files may contain personal data which we may use in accordance with this Policy.</p> Beacons <p>Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages on some of our website.\nWe may use beacons to analyze the traffic patterns on our website, such as the frequency with which users visit various parts of our website, or in HTML e-mails that we may send to our users to determine whether those e-mails are opened or whether the links in the e-mails are followed.\nCertain data obtained from beacons may contain personal data which we may use in accordance with this Policy.</p>\n<i>(C) Information we receive from others</i>\n<p>We are also working closely with third parties (including, for example, business partners, service providers, advertising networks and analytics providers) and may receive information about you from them.\nThis may be combined with other information you provide to us, as described above.</p>\n<p>We may also collect personal data on third party network, platform or service: by playing a RYSEUP game through another third party platform such as a gaming console or mobile device operator, social network, you are authorizing RYSEUP to (1) collect, store, and use, in accordance with this Policy, any and all personal information that you agreed the social network or other third party platform could provide to RYSEUP based on your settings on the third party social network or platform and (2) share any and all of your personal information with the social network or other third party platform, through the social network/third party platform\u2019s Application Programming Interface (API).\nYour agreement to this takes place when you connect with the third party network, platform or service via our products and/or services, and/or when you connect with, \u201caccept\u201d or \u201callow\u201d (or similar terms) one of our applications through a social network, or other third party platform or service.</p>\n<p>\n<i>The legal grounds of our data processing</i>\n</p>\n<p>We process data only if at least one of the following applies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have given consent to the processing of your data;</li>\n<li>The existence of our legitimate

concerned;</li>\n<li>We are required to comply with legal and regulatory obligations, which require the processing of the personal data concerned.</li>\n</ul> 3.\nHow we use and share information

subsequently is intended for us in our capacity as data controller.</p>\n<p>We ensure that only authorized persons have access to this data.\nSome personal data may be sent to third parties or to legally authorized authorities in order to meet our legal, regulatory or contractual obligations (as described below).</p>\n<p>When sharing your information with our technical service providers and/or subcontractors for proper operation of our website, we are committed to ensuring these technical service providers and/or subcontractors comply with the terms in this Policy.\nIf RYSEUP subcontracts all or part of the processing of personal data to processors, RYSEUP will require that its processors provide contractual guarantees on the security and confidentiality of personal data by means of technical data protection measures and appropriate human resources.</p>\n<p>If disclosing personal data is required by law or necessary for protecting the security of our website, we may disclose any information collected, without time limits.\nWe will ensure that any such disclosure remains within the limits permitted by law and within the scope authorized, and we will only do this if we believe in good faith it is necessary for: (i) protecting your security, including the security of your property.\n(ii) protecting the security of our website or third-party websites.</p>\n<p>You understand that when you use the Services, any information you post in any interactive areas of the Services, as well as any information you share with individuals through public or private groups, as well as any information you share with individuals through the Services or through social network sites or other social feeds, will be available to other users and in some cases may be publicly available.\nWe recommend you be cautious about giving out personal data to others or sharing personal data in public or private online groups.\nExcept to the extent required by applicable law, we are not responsible for the actions of third party service providers or other third parties, nor are we responsible for any additional information you provide directly to any third parties.</p> 4.\nHow we secure your information <p>Maintaining the security and confidentiality of your information is of utmost concern to us.\nThat\u2019s why we implement appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, with regard to the nature of the data we process and the risks of the processing, to protect your personal data from accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure, or access / use by non-authorized third parties and other unlawful forms of processing, in compliance with data protection regulations.\nWe also strive to limit access to personal data to employees or contractors performing a legitimate business function.</p>\n<p>We carry out periodic reviews of our security procedures with a view to implementing new and updated technologies where appropriate.\nHowever, despite the wide range of initiatives and measures in place, no security protocol is perfect, infallible or impenetrable.</p> 5.\nYour choices on collection and use of
