opportunity to review the fees that you will be charged before you accept them.\nIf you purchase a recurring subscription, you authorize Copilot or its third-party service providers to periodically charge you for an automatically renewing subscription requiring recurring payments at the stated frequency (e.g., monthly or annual) (each a \u201cSubscription Period\u201d) until cancelled.\nYou will

charges.</p>\n<p>D.\n<strong>\n<em>Cancellation</em>\n</strong>.\nWhen you cancel a subscription, you cancel only future charges associated with your subscription.\nYou may initiate your cancellation

the end of your current Subscription Period.\nIf you purchased through Copilot directly, you may cancel within your account settings.\nAlternatively, if you email us at support@copilot.money at least 24 hours before the end of your current Subscription Period, we will do our best to implement the cancellation prior to your next renewal.\nif we cannot, we can offer you a refund for that inadvertent renewal.\nIf you purchased through a third party (e.g., app store), you must cancel through that third party.\nPurchases through third parties are subject to that third party\u2019s cancellation

retroactively.</p>\n<p>If your subscription includes a free trial, you will not be charged the applicable fee during your free trial.\nTo obtain the free trial, you will be required to provide a credit card or other payment method in order to ensure uninterrupted access and continued use after the free trial ends.\nUpon completion of your free trial, your subscription will automatically convert into a paid subscription and your payment method will be charged the Subscription Fee unless you have cancelled your subscription.\nYou may cancel your subscription during your free trial to avoid being charged as described above.</p>\n<p>If your subscription includes a promotional rate, you will be charged the promotional rate for the relevant number of Subscription Periods and upon completion of the final promotional Subscription Period, your subscription will continue to automatically renew at the full rate.\nTo cancel and avoid being charged the full rate, you must notify us before the discount or promotional period ends.</p>\n<p>If a stated price or other material information is determined by us in our sole discretion to be in error, we are not under any obligation to

you purchase an additional subscription, you may not be eligible for a free trial or to take advantage of another discounted price offer.</p>\n<p>G.\n<strong>Termination</strong>.\nWe may terminate your subscription at our sole discretion and without any notice.\nIf we cancel your subscription, we may give you a prorated refund based on the amount of time remaining that you cannot use, provided, however, that we will not be obligated to grant you a refund if we terminate your account or your subscription because we determine, in our sole discretion, that your actions or your use of the Service violates these Terms, any applicable law, or has harmed Copilot or another user or entity.</p>\n<p>Upon termination or cancellation of your subscription, you may lose access to the products, content, features, and work-product provided to you or created by you in relation to the Service.</p>\n<p>H.\n<strong>Changes to the Subscription or Service</strong>.\nWe may change the subscription

and features from a subscription.\nIf you do not cancel your subscription prior to the time the modifications become effective, you agree to the changes.\nIf you do not wish to continue subscribing

expedient and cost-effective manner, you and Copilot agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Service will be resolved by binding arbitration.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury and can be subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\nThis agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the expiration or termination of these Terms.\nYOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND COPILOT ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nYOU FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT THESE DISPUTE RESOLUTION TERMS WILL APPLY TO YOU AND COPILOT UNLESS YOU CHOOSE TO OPT OUT PURSUANT TO SECTION 14.I (OPT OUT).</p>\n<p>Whether to agree to arbitration is an important business decision.\nIt is your decision to make, and you should not rely solely on the information provided in these Terms as it is not intended to contain a complete explanation of the consequences of arbitration.\nYou should take further steps to conduct research and to consult with others, including an attorney, regarding the consequences of your decision, just as you would when making any other important business or life decision.</p>\n<p>B.\n<strong>\n<em>Exceptions</em>\n</strong>.\nDespite the provisions of Section 14.A (Generally), nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (1) bring an individual action in small claims court.\n(2) bring an action in a court pursuant to the California Private Attorneys General Act of 2004, California Labor Code \u00a7 2698 et seq..\n(3) seek injunctive relief in a court of law.\nor (4) file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p>\n<p>C.\n<strong>\n<em>Arbitrator</em>\n</strong>.\nAny arbitration between you and Copilot will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, \u201c<strong>AAA Rules</strong>\u201d) of the American Arbitration Association (\u201c<strong>AAA</strong>\u201d), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA.\nThe AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Copilot.\nThe arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>D.\n<strong>\n<em>Notice.\nProcess</em>\n</strong>.\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by U.S.\nMail within the applicable statute of limitations period (\u201c<strong>Notice</strong>\u201d).\nCopilot\u2019s address for Notice is: 45 Tudor City Place, Apt 1118, New York, NY 10017.\nThe Notice must: (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\u201c<strong>Demand</strong>\u201d).\nThe parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Copilot may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Copilot must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIf the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Copilot will pay you the highest of the following: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any.\n(b) the last written settlement amount offered by Copilot in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator\u2019s award.\nor (c) $1,000.</p>\n<p>E.\n<strong>\n<em>Fees</em>\n</strong>.\nIf you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Copilot will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.\nAny arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Wilmington, Delaware, but if the claim is for $15,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.\nIf the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\nIn that case, you agree to reimburse Copilot for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits.</p>\n<p>F.\n<strong>\n<em>No Class Actions</em>\n</strong>.\nYOU AND COPILOT AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (OTHER THAN ACTIONS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT OF 2004, CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE \u00a7 2698 ET SEQ.\nWHICH ARE NOT COVERED BY THIS SECTION 14 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)).\nUnless both you and Copilot agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>\n<p>G.\n<strong>\n<em>Modifications to this Arbitration Provision</em>\n</strong>.\nIf Copilot makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Copilot\u2019s address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Copilot\u2019s address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and Copilot.\nIf you do not send such written notice, your continued use of the Service following any such change means that you have consented to such change.</p>\n<p>H.\n<strong>\n<em>Enforceability</em>\n</strong>.\nIf Section 14.F (No Class Actions) is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 14 (Dispute Resolution) is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 14 (Dispute Resolution) will be null and void and the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 17 (Governing Law.\nChoice of Forum) will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of the Service.</p>\n<p>I.\n<strong>\n<em>Opt Out</em>\n</strong>.\nArbitration is not a mandatory condition of these Terms.\nIf you do not want to be subject to this Section 14 (Dispute Resolution), you may opt out of this Section 14 (Dispute Resolution) by notifying Copilot in writing of your decision by sending, within 30 days of the date you receive these Terms, an electronic message to support@copilot.money, stating clearly your full name and intent to opt out of this Section 14 (Dispute Resolution).\nShould you choose not to opt out of this Section 14 (Dispute Resolution) within the 30-day period, you and Copilot will be bound by the terms of this Section 14 (Dispute Resolution).\nYou have the right to consult with counsel of your choice concerning this Section 14 (Dispute Resolution).\nYou understand that you will not be subject to retaliation if you exercise your right to opt out of coverage under this Section 14 (Dispute Resolution).</p>\n<p>15.\n<strong>Cooperation with Authorities</strong>.\nCopilot may cooperate with legal authorities and/or third parties in the investigation of any suspected or alleged crime or civil wrong.\nExcept as may be expressly limited by the Privacy Policy, Copilot may disclose any information as Copilot deems necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, or to edit, refuse to post, or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, in Copilot\u2019s sole discretion.</p>\n<p>16.\n<strong>Protected Activity Not Prohibited</strong>.\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, nothing in these Terms will in any way limit or prohibit you from filing a charge or complaint with, or otherwise communicating or cooperating with or participating in, any investigation or proceeding (\u201c<strong>Protected Activity</strong>\u201d) that may be conducted by any federal, state, or local government agency or commission (\u201c<strong>Government Agencies</strong>\u201d).\nIn connection with such Protected Activity, you are permitted to disclose documents or other information as permitted by law, and without giving notice to, or receiving authorization from, Copilot.\nIn making any such disclosures or communications, you agree to take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of any information that may constitute Copilot confidential information to any parties other than the Government Agencies.</p>\n<p>17.\n<strong>Governing Law.\nChoice of Forum</strong>.\nThe laws of the State of New York, excluding its conflicts of law rules, govern these Terms and your use of the Service.\nYour use of the Service may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.\nprovided, however, that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to any provision of these Terms.\nTo the extent that any action relating to any dispute hereunder is permitted to be brought in a court of law, such action will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in New York County, New York and you hereby irrevocably submit to personal jurisdiction in such courts, and waive any defense of inconvenient forum.</p>\n<p>18.\n<strong>Feedback</strong>.\nIf you provide any feedback to Copilot concerning the functionality and performance of the Service (including identifying potential errors and improvements), you hereby assign to Copilot all right, title, and interest in and to such feedback, and Copilot is free to use such feedback without payment or restriction.</p>\n<p>19.\n<strong>Entire Agreement.\nVariation</strong>.\nThese Terms and the Privacy Policy set forth the entire agreement between Copilot and you with respect to the Service.\nThese Terms supersede and govern all previous oral and written communications regarding these matters, all of which are merged into these Terms.\nNo usage of trade or other regular practice or method of dealing between the parties will be used to modify, interpret, supplement, or alter these Terms.</p>\n<p>20.\n<strong>Severability</strong>.\nIf any provision of these Terms is held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, such provisions will be modified, or if not possible, severed, to reflect the fullest valid, legal, and enforceable expression of the intent of the parties, and the remainder of these Terms will not be affected thereby.</p>\n<p>21.\n<strong>Relationship of Parties</strong>.\nNothing in these Terms will be deemed to create an employer-employee relationship between Copilot and you, nor any agency, joint venture, or partnership relationship between the parties.\nNeither party will have the right to bind the other to any obligation, nor have the right to incur any liability on behalf of the other.</p>\n<p>22.\n<strong>Waiver</strong>.\nNo delay, omission, or failure to exercise any right or remedy provided under these Terms will be deemed to be a waiver thereof or an acquiescence to the event giving rise to such right or remedy, or a waiver of or acquiescence to any other right, remedy, or event.</p>\n<p>23.\n<strong>Assignment</strong>.\nNeither these Terms nor any of the rights granted to you herein may be assigned or transferred by you, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the express prior written permission of Copilot and any attempt to do so will be null and void.\nCopilot may assign or transfer these Terms at any time without your permission.</p>\n<p>24.\n<strong>Third-Party Beneficiaries</strong>.\nThe provisions of these Terms relating to the rights of Copilot service providers are intended for the benefit of such service providers, and such service providers, as third-party beneficiaries, will be entitled to enforce such provisions in accordance with these Terms, irrespective of the fact that they are not parties to
