Policy</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>SP Plus Corporation (<strong>\"SP+\"</strong>) uses ALPR Systems at certain parking facilities where permitted by law and in accordance with the procedures provided

employees whose jobs require such use or access including, without limitation, lot checkers, parking attendants, enforcement agents, and facility managers, or independent contractors who are required to access such information in order to provide a service to SP+ or its clients.\nSuch employees and independent contractors are required to be trained on information security procedures and receive personalized training at the local parking facility level.\n</li>\n<li>ALPR Information collected by SP+ is stored in compliance with applicable data privacy laws within our secure internal SQL and

applicable data privacy laws and security standards when accessing or storing such information.\n</li>\n<li>SP+ does not sell ALPR Information.\nIn states where collection is permitted for unpaid parking citations, we will share parking violation information with a thirty-party collection agency.\n</li>\n<li>For ALPR Information at parking facilities in California, SP+: <ol>\n<li>Maintains a record of access to its ALPR Information which shows: <ol>\n<li>The date and time the information is accessed;</li>\n<li>The license plate number or other data elements used to query the ALPR System;</li>\n<li>The username of the person who accesses the information, and, as applicable, the organization or entity with whom the person is affiliated.\nand</li>\n<li>The purpose for accessing
