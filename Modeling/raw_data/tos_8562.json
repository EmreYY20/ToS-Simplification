in Other Jurisdiction\nChanges To This Privacy Statement\nContacting Us Etison LLC (\u201c<b>Etison</b>,\u201d \u201c<b>us</b>,\u201d \u201c<b>we</b>,\u201d or \u201c<b>our</b>\u201d) thanks you for visiting the <b>online and mobile resources</b> we publish.\nWe use the words \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d to mean you, the reader, and other visitors to our online and mobile resources who are, in all cases, over the age of 13.\nOur privacy statement (\u201c<b>this statement</b>,\u201d \u201c<b>this privacy statement</b>,\u201d and \u201c<b>our statement</b>\u201d) informs you about from whom and the types of personal information we collect, how we use it, who we share it with and why, and what we do to try to protect it.&nbsp.\n<br>\n<b>Online and mobile resources</b> means the websites and other internet features we own that allow you to interact with our websites, as well as apps we\u2019ve created and distributed to let our customers and followers view our online and mobile resources or otherwise interact with the content we provide.&nbsp.\n<b>WHO WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM&nbsp;</b> We may collect personal information from the following groups of data subjects: visitors to, and users of, our online and mobile resources.\nour customers.\ncurrent members of our workforce and those who apply for posted jobs.\nand third party vendors and business partners.&nbsp.\n<br>\n<b>Personal information</b> generally means information that can be used to identify you or that can be easily linked to you (for example, your name, address, telephone number, email address, social security number and date of birth).\nThe privacy laws in some jurisdictions include unique elements in what they consider to be the personal information of the consumers or data subjects they protect.\nIf those laws apply to us, as in the case of the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201c<b>CCPA</b>\u201d) or European General Data Protection Regulation (\u201c<b>GDPR</b>\u201d), our use of the phrase \u201cpersonal information\u201d includes the unique elements required by such laws.&nbsp.\n<br>\nThe categories of information we collect from each of these groups, and the ways in which we use it, differs.\nAs you may have noticed, it\u2019s possible that the same person could fall into more than one group.\nMost of this statement addresses our processing and sharing of personal information collected from visitors to and users of our online and mobile resources and our customers.&nbsp.\n<br>\nNonetheless, we collect and retain the types of <b>professional or employment related personal information</b> you would expect an employer to have about its existing and former workforce and new job applicants.\nWe provide legally required notices of collection, and describe our use and sharing of the personal information of our workforce and applicants in greater detail in confidential internal human resource manuals and documents accessible to members of our workforce, or by publication on the proprietary workforce/applicant portals and apps we operate.\nIn some cases, such portals and apps may be operated by third parties who transfer the personal information to us.\nIn those situations, the legal responsibility to provide notice usually rests with the third party, not us.\n<br>\nIn addition, like all corporate enterprises, we buy goods and services, lease equipment and office space and attend industry events.\nIn doing so, we interact with many existing and potential <b>vendors and business partners</b> from whom we necessarily collect certain personal information in connection with our contractual and business relationships.\nAs with our customers, this information is typically limited to minimum business contact information.\nWe use and share personal information collected from our vendors and business partners to manage, administer and perform under our contracts with them, or share information about our products.\nWe describe our use of vendor and business partner personal information in greater detail in our confidential contracts with those parties or on the internal vendor management portals we operate.&nbsp.\n<b>WHAT WE COLLECT</b> There are two types of information that we obtain from you online and then store and use: (i) non-personal information that\u2019s collected automatically from each visitor, such as your device operating system.\nand (ii) personal information that you voluntarily provide to us or that is collected automatically.&nbsp.\n<br>\n<b>\n<i>By using our online and mobile resources or purchasing our products or services, you are signifying to us that you agree with this section of our privacy statement and that we may use and disclose your information as described.</i>\n</b>\n<br>\n<i>\n<u>Voluntarily Submitted Information</u>\n</i>\n&nbsp.\nIf you participate in certain activities via our online and mobile resources, you may be asked to provide us with information about yourself.\nThe types of personal information we collect in those situations includes <b>identifiers</b> (such as your name, email address, physical address, and phone number), <b>professional information</b> (such as the business you are in), and <b>financial account information</b> (such as your credit card information).\nWe do not sell, rent, or trade voluntarily submitted personal information with third parties.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<br>\nIf you don\u2019t want us to collect this type of personal information, please don\u2019t provide it.\nThis means you shouldn\u2019t participate in the activities on our online and mobile resources that request or require it and you may want to communicate with us by phone or regular mail instead.\nParticipation is strictly your choice.\nNot participating may limit your ability to take full advantage of the online and mobile resources, but it will not affect your ability to access certain information available to the general public on the online and mobile resources.&nbsp.\n<br> Some of the ways you voluntarily give us your personal information and how we use it: <b>Emails and Online Forms</b> \u2013 When you send us an email or fill out an online form, such as to contact us, your email address and any other personal information (e.g., home address or phone number) that may be in the content of your message or attached to it, are retained by us and used to respond back directly to you and to process your request.\nDepending on the personal information provided, communications from us may be in the form of emails, telephone calls, and/or text messages.\nWe may also send you information about any of our products or services we think may be of interest to you.\n<br>\n<b>Registering for an Account</b> \u2013 When you register for an account or you register your child for a sub-account, you submit personal information to us such as your name and email address (or your child\u2019s name and email address) which we then retain.\nWe use that information to create and manage your account and in some cases establish a password and profile to communicate with you and any sub-accounts you created via email.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<br>\n<b>Registering for Events</b> \u2013 When you register for events, conferences or programs we ourselves may host (rather than outsource to a third party event manager with its own privacy policies), you will be submitting the types of identifiers described above.\nIf the event requires a fee, we may also ask you to submit credit card or other financial information.\nWe use this information to register you for the event and send you communications regarding the event.\n<br>\n<b>Becoming a Subscriber to Our Service</b> \u2013 We use any information provided from our customers to perform our contractual obligations and provide the products and services purchased to them, to manage their accounts and communicate with them.\n<br>\n<b>Social Media and Community Features</b> \u2013 Some of our online and mobile resources may offer social media-like community features letting users post messages and comments, and/or upload an image or other files and materials.\nIf you choose to make use of these features, the information you post, including your screen name and any other personal information, will be in the public domain and not covered/protected by this statement.\n<i>Automatically Collected Information</i>\n<br>When you visit our online and mobile resources, basic information is passively collected through your web browser

allows us to recognize your computer or mobile device and store some information about your preferences or past actions.\nAdditional information can be found in our Cookie Policy.\nYou can learn more about cookies and tracking technologies in general here.\n<br>\nWe allow third party vendors to use cookies or similar technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time following your use of the site.\nFor example, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc.\n(\"<b>Google</b>\").\nGoogle Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how you

our online and mobile resources.\nand the specific links from other sites you used to access our online and mobile resources.\n<br>\nAdditionally, if you access our online and mobile resources from a phone or other mobile device, the mobile services provider may transmit to us uniquely identifiable mobile device information which allows us to then collect mobile phone numbers and associate them with the mobile device identification information.\nSome mobile phone vendors also operate systems that pinpoint the physical location of devices and we may receive this information as well if location services are enabled on your device.\nIf you do not want us to collect and use <b>geolocation data</b>, disable location services through your device settings.\n<br>\nRegardless, we use both automatically collected information and mobile device information to compile generic reports about popular pages on our online and mobile resources, and to see how our customers and followers are accessing our online and mobile resources.\nWe then use that data to administer the online and mobile resources and make them better, make your activities more convenient and efficient and to enhance the functionality of our online and mobile resources, such as by remembering certain of your information in order to save you time.&nbsp.\n<br>\n<i>Data Retention<br>\n</i>We use and retain your personal information in accordance with applicable law and as long as necessary to carry out the purposes described above in accordance with our internal data retention procedures.\nThe criteria used to determine our retention periods include: (i) the length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you.\n(ii) whether there is an applicable legal obligation.\nor (iii) whether retention is advisable to enforce our agreements, satisfy applicable statutes of limitations, resolve disputes, or manage litigation or regulatory investigations.<br>\n<i>User Beware: External Sites, Apps, Links and Social Media<br>\n</i>We maintain a presence on one or more external social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and LinkedIn.\nWe may further allow features of our online and mobile resources to connect with, or be viewable from, that external social media presence.\nSimilarly, our online and mobile resources may contain links to other websites or apps controlled by third parties.&nbsp.\n<br>\nWe are not responsible for either the content on, or the privacy practices of, social media platforms, or any third party sites or apps to which we link.\nThose apps, sites and platforms are not controlled by us and therefore have their own privacy policies and terms of use.\nIf you have questions about how those apps, sites and platforms collect and use personal information, you should carefully read their privacy policies and contact them using the information they provide.&nbsp.\n<br>\n<b>WHEN/WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION</b> We use

\u201cour\u201d) thanks you for visiting the online and mobile resources we publish.\nWe use the words \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d to mean you, the reader, and other visitors to our online and mobile resources who are, in all cases, over the age of 13.\n&nbsp;Our privacy statement (\u201cthis statement,\u201d \u201cthis privacy statement,\u201d and \u201cour statement\u201d) informs you about from whom and the types of personal information we collect, how we use it, who we share it with and why, and what we do to try to protect it.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOnline and mobile resources means the websites and other internet features we own that allow you to interact with our websites, as well as apps we\u2019ve created and distributed to let our customers and followers view our online and mobile resources or otherwise interact with the content we provide.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWHO WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe may collect personal information from the following groups of data subjects: visitors to, and users of, our online and mobile resources.\nour customers.\ncurrent members of our workforce and those who apply for posted jobs.\nand third party vendors and business partners.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nPersonal information&nbsp;generally means information that can be used to identify you or that can be easily linked to you (for example, your name, address, telephone number, email address, social security number and date of birth).\nThe privacy laws in some jurisdictions include unique elements in what they consider to be the personal information of the consumers or data subjects they protect.\nIf those laws apply to us, as in the case of the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) or European General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), our use of the phrase \u201cpersonal information\u201d includes the unique elements required by such laws.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe categories of information we collect from each of these groups, and the ways in which we use it, differs.\nAs you may have noticed, it\u2019s possible that the same person could fall into more than one group.\nMost of this statement addresses our processing and sharing of personal information collected from visitors to and users of our online and mobile resources and our customers.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nNonetheless, we collect and retain the types of professional or employment related personal information&nbsp;you would expect an employer to have about its existing and former workforce and new job applicants.\nWe provide legally required notices of collection, and describe our use and sharing of the personal information of our workforce and applicants in greater detail in confidential internal human resource manuals and documents accessible to members of our workforce, or by publication on the proprietary workforce/applicant portals and apps we operate.\nIn some cases, such portals and apps may be operated by third parties who transfer the personal information to us.\nIn those situations, the legal responsibility to provide notice usually rests with the third party, not us.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIn addition, like all corporate enterprises, we buy goods and services, lease equipment and office space and attend industry events.\nIn doing so, we interact with many existing and potential vendors and business partners&nbsp;from whom we necessarily collect certain personal information in connection with our contractual and business relationships.\nAs with our customers, this information is typically limited to minimum business contact information.\nWe use and share personal information collected from our vendors and business partners to manage, administer and perform under our contracts with them, or share information about our products.\nWe describe our use of vendor and business partner personal information in greater detail in our confidential contracts with those parties or on the internal vendor management portals we operate.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWHAT WE COLLECT </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThere are two types of information that we obtain from you online and then store and use: (i) non-personal information that\u2019s collected automatically from each visitor, such as your device operating system.\nand (ii) personal information that you voluntarily provide to us or that is collected automatically.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBy using our online and mobile resources or purchasing our products or services, you are signifying to us that you agree with this section of our privacy statement and that we may use and disclose your information as described.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nVoluntarily Submitted Information.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nIf you participate in certain activities via our online and mobile resources, you may be asked to provide us with information about yourself.\nThe types of personal information we collect in those situations includes identifiers&nbsp;(such as your name, email address, physical address, and phone number), professional information&nbsp;(such as the business you are in), and financial account information&nbsp;(such as your credit card information).\nWe do not sell, rent, or trade voluntarily submitted personal information with third parties.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you don\u2019t want us to collect this type of personal information, please don\u2019t provide it.\nThis means you shouldn\u2019t participate in the activities on our online and mobile resources that request or require it and you may want to communicate with us by phone or regular mail instead.\nParticipation is strictly your choice.\nNot participating may limit your ability to take full advantage of the online and mobile resources, but it will not affect your ability to access certain information available to the general public on the online and mobile resources.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nSome of the ways you voluntarily give us your personal information and how we use it:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nEmails and Online Forms \u2013 When you send us an email or fill out an online form, such as to contact us, your email address and any other personal information (e.g., home address or phone number) that may be in the content of your message or attached to it, are retained by us and used to respond back directly to you and to process your request.\nDepending on the personal information provided, communications from us may be in the form of emails, telephone calls, and/or text messages.\nWe may also send you information about any of our products or services we think may be of interest to you.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nRegistering for an Account&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;When you register for an account or you register your child for a sub-account, you submit personal information to us such as your name and email address (or your child\u2019s name and email address) which we then retain.\nWe use that information to create and manage your account and in some cases establish a password and profile to communicate with you and any sub-accounts you created via email.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nRegistering for Events \u2013&nbsp;When you register for events, conferences or programs we ourselves may host (rather than outsource to a third party event manager with its own privacy policies), you will be submitting the types of identifiers described above.\nIf the event requires a fee, we may also ask you to submit credit card or other financial information.\nWe use this information to register you for the event and send you communications regarding the event.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBecoming a Subscriber to Our Service \u2013&nbsp;We use any information provided from our customers to perform our contractual obligations and provide the products and services purchased to them, to manage their accounts and communicate with them.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nSocial Media and Community Features \u2013 Some of&nbsp;our online and mobile resources may offer social media-like community features letting users post messages and comments, and/or upload an image or other files and materials.\nIf you choose to make use of these features, the information you post, including your screen name and any other personal information, will be in the public domain and not covered/protected by this statement.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAutomatically Collected Information.</p>\n<p>\nWhen you visit our online and mobile resources, basic

or similar technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time following your use of the site.\nFor example, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc.\n(\"Google\").\nGoogle Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how you use the online and mobile resources and enhance your experience when you visit the online and mobile

address from which you accessed our online and mobile resources.\nthe type of browser and operating system you use.\nthe date and time and length of your visit.\nthe specific page visited, graphics viewed and any documents downloaded.\nthe specific links to other sites you accessed from our online and mobile resources.\nand the specific links from other sites you used to access our online and mobile resources.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAdditionally, if you access our online and mobile resources from a phone or other mobile device, the mobile services provider may transmit to us uniquely identifiable mobile device information which allows us to then collect mobile phone numbers and associate them with the mobile device identification information.\nSome mobile phone vendors also operate systems that pinpoint the physical location of devices and we may receive this information as well if location services are enabled on your device.\nIf you do not want us to collect and use geolocation data, disable location services through your device settings.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nRegardless, we use both automatically collected information and mobile device information to compile generic reports about popular pages on our online and mobile resources, and to see how our customers and followers are accessing our online and mobile resources.\nWe then use that data to administer the online and mobile resources and make them better, make your activities more convenient and efficient and to enhance the functionality of our online and mobile resources, such as by remembering certain of your information in order to save you time.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe use and retain your personal information in accordance with applicable law and as long as necessary to carry out the purposes described above in accordance with our internal data retention procedures.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nUser Beware: External Sites, Apps, Links and Social Media.</p>\n<p>\nWe maintain a presence on one or more external social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and LinkedIn.\nWe may further allow features of our online and mobile resources to connect with, or be viewable from, that external social media presence.\nSimilarly, our online and mobile resources may contain links to other websites or apps controlled by third parties.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe are not responsible for either the content on, or the privacy practices of, social media platforms, or any third party sites or apps to which we link.\nThose apps, sites and platforms are not controlled by us and therefore have their own privacy policies and terms of use.\nIf you have questions about how those apps, sites and platforms collect and use personal information, you should carefully read their privacy policies and contact them using the information they provide.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWHEN/WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe use non-personal information to administer our online and mobile resources, make them better, and to make business decisions about what programs our customers might like.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe use voluntarily provided personal information for our legitimate interests, including to respond to your inquiries and provide you with the services you have requested, amongst other uses as further described below.\nWe do not sell or rent your personal information to third party data vendors or marketing companies.\nAs you might expect, we disclose your information when required by law.\nWe may use your

intend for our online and mobile resources to be used by children under the age of 13 without first obtaining the verifiable consent of such child\u2019s parent or legal guardian.\nMoreover, we do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under the age of 13, only a parent or legal guardian may provide such information after adhering to our verification process for submitting such

someone under the age of 18 has submitted personal information to our online and mobile resources, please contact us at compliance@clickfunnels.com.\nWe encourage parents and legal guardians to talk with their children about the potential risks of providing personal information over the Internet.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nHOW WE PROTECT COLLECTED PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe

organizational, administrative, and other security measures designed to protect, in a manner consistent with accepted industry standards and applicable law, against anticipated or actual threats to the security of personal information (the \u201cSecurity Program\u201d).\nWe cannot, however, guarantee that your information, whether during transmission or while stored on our systems or otherwise

activated whenever we become aware that your personal information was likely to have been compromised.\nWe further require, as part of our vendor and business partner oversight procedures, that such parties notify us immediately if they have any reason to believe that an incident adversely affecting personal information we provided to them has occurred.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nTHE

dispute, or controversy, you agree to first contact us at compliance@clickfunnels.com to attempt to resolve the dispute or controversy informally.\nAny controversy or claim arising out of or related to the use of the Website, any product, service, or software, these Terms, the Privacy Statement, the DPA, the Affiliate Agreement, or your relationship with us that cannot be resolved through such

(\u201cAAA\u201d), and judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\nWe agree that any claim we may have against you or your business will also be subject to this arbitration provision, except as provided in Sections 20 and 21 below.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator in the English language in Ada County, Idaho, unless we

Rules of the AAA.\nThe arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules and Procedures, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration.\nThe AAA\u2019s Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nThe arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the

disputes will only be arbitrated on an individual basis and shall not be consolidated, on a class wide, representative basis, or with any other arbitration(s) or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.\nYou and ClickFunnels expressly waive any right to pursue any class or other representative action against each other.\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular claim will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other claims except that all claims must be brought within 1 year after the claim arises (the 1 year period includes the one hundred and twenty (120) day informal resolution procedures described above).\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>This arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to final and binding confidential arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the

shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply.\nIf a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE, AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nHOWEVER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH BINDING, FINAL, AND CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION.\n<br>\n</p>SECTION 20 \u2013 CLICKFUNNELS\u2019 ADDITIONAL REMEDIES <p>In order to prevent or limit irreparable injury to ClickFunnels, in

Before You Start How to Submit <i>\n</i> Contact a human <i>\n</i> What is the (DMCA)? The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) creates a standardized process for copyright holders (including software developers) to ask ClickFunnels to take down infringing content.\nYou can find more information about the DMCA at the U.S.\nCopyright Office's official website.\n<br>As with all legal matters, it is always best to consult with a professional about your specific questions or situation.\nWe strongly encourage you to do so before taking any action that might impact your rights.\nOur guides are NOT legal advice and shouldn't be taken as such.\nBefore You Start <b>\n<u>Tell the Truth.</u>\n</b>&nbsp;The DMCA requires that you swear to the facts in your notice of infringement under penalty of perjury.\nIt is a federal crime to intentionally lie in a sworn declaration.\n(See U.S.\nCode, Title 18, Section 1621).\nSubmitting false information could also result in civil liability\u2014that is, you could get sued for money damages.\n<br>\n<b>\n<u>Investigate.</u>\n</b>&nbsp;Millions of users and organizations pour their hearts and souls into the content they create using ClickFunnels.\nFiling a DMCA notice of infringement against such is a serious legal allegation that carries real consequences for real people.\nBecause of that, we ask that you conduct a thorough investigation and consult with an attorney before submitting a takedown request to make sure that the use isn't actually permissible.\n<br>\n<b>\n<u>Ask Nicely First.</u>\n</b>&nbsp;A great first step before sending us a takedown notice is to try contacting the user directly.\n<br>\n<b>\n<u>No Bots.</u>\n</b>&nbsp;You should have a trained professional evaluate the facts of every takedown notice you send.\nIf you are outsourcing your efforts to a third party, make sure you know how they operate, and make sure they are not using automated bots to submit notices in bulk.\nThese notices are often invalid and processing them results in needlessly taking down content.\n<br>\n<b>\n<u>You May Receive a Counter Notice.</u>\n</b>&nbsp;Any user affected by your takedown notice may decide to submit a counter notice.\nIf they do, we will re-enable their content within 14 days unless you notify us that you have initiated a legal action seeking to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the content on ClickFunnels.\n<br>\n<b>\n<u>ClickFunnels Isn't The Judge!</u>\n</b>&nbsp;ClickFunnels exercises little discretion in the process other than determining whether the notices meet the minimum requirements of the DMCA.\nIt is up to the parties (and their lawyers) to evaluate the merit of their claims, bearing in mind that notices must be made under penalty of perjury.\nHow to Submit Your Notice and Counter Notice&nbsp.\n<b>\n<i>The fastest way to get a response is to enter your information and answer all of the questions on our takedown or counter notification form(s):</i>\n</b>\n<br>\n<b>Submit a DMCA Takedown Notice</b>\n<br>\nIf someone else is using your copyrighted content in an unauthorized manner on ClickFunnels, fill out the form below to submit a DMCA takedown notice and request that the infringing content be changed or removed.\nBefore you begin, please ensure that you can answer the requirements for DMCA counter notifications.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nSubmit a DMCA takedown notice\n<br>\nYou can also send an email notification to compliance@clickfunnels.com.\nYou may include an attachment if you like, but please also include a plain-text version of your letter in the body of your message.\n<br>\nIf you must send your notice by physical mail, you can do that too, but it will take substantially longer for us to receive and respond to it.\nNotices we receive via plain-text email have a much faster turnaround than PDF attachments or physical mail.\nIf you still wish to mail us your notice, our physical address is: <br>\nAttention Legal Department DMCA Notice ClickFunnels 3443 W.\nBavaria Street Eagle, Idaho 83616 <br>\n<i>By submitting a DMCA notice via our form, email, or physical mail, you acknowledge that a copy of your DMCA submission disclosing all information provided may be shared with the accused party.</i>\n<br>\n<b>Submit a DMCA Counter Notice</b>\n<br>\nIf you believe your content on ClickFunnels was mistakenly disabled by a DMCA takedown request, you have the right to contest the takedown by submitting a counter notice.\nBefore you begin, please ensure that you can answer the requirements for DMCA counter notifications.&nbsp.\n<br>\nSubmit a DMCA counter notice\n<br>\nYou may also submit a counter notice by e-mail or physical mail, as set forth above.\n<b>Fill out the form below by answering the following questions:</b> 1.) Identify the copyrighted work you believe has been infringed.<br>\n<br>\n2.) Identify the material that you allege is infringing the copyrighted work listed in item #1, above.\n<br>\n3.) Explain what the affected user would need to do in order to remedy the infringement.\n<br>\n4.) Provide your contact information.\nInclude your email address, name, telephone number and physical address.\n<br>\n5.) Include the following statement: \"I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.\nI have taken fair use into consideration.\"\n<br>\n6.) Also include the following statement: \"I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\"\n<br>\n7.) Include your full legal name to act as electronic signature.\n<br>\n8.) Please confirm that you have read our policy for DMCA takedown requests.\n<i>\n</i> send request <i>\n</i> 1.) Identify the content that was disabled and the location where it appeared.\nThe disabled content should have been identified by URL in the takedown notice.\nYou simply need to copy the URL(s) that you want to challenge.\n<br>\n2.) Provide your contact information.\nInclude your email address, name, telephone number, and physical address.\n<br>\n3.) Include the following statement: \"I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\" You may also choose to communicate the reasons why you believe there was a mistake or misidentification.\nIf you think of your counter notice as a \"note\" to the complaining party, this is a chance to explain why they should not take the next step and file a lawsuit in response.\nThis is yet another reason to work with a lawyer when submitting a counter notice.\n<br>\n4.) Include the following statement: \"I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.\"\n<br>\n5.)
