ours&nbsp;uses cookies.\nCookies are small text files that we put on your computer, that&nbsp;allow us to provide you with a better browsing experience.\nBy using this website, you agree to let us use cookies.\nFor a more detailed description, please read on.</p>\n<p>This notice is applicable to any user&nbsp;of the&nbsp;EuroDNS&nbsp;Website, without regards to them qualifying as a EuroDNS Customer as defined in EuroDNS General Terms and Conditions or not (the \"User\").</p>\n<p>\n<strong>By using the&nbsp;EuroDNS&nbsp;Website with an Internet browser set to accept the storage of cookies the User confirms its agreement to the use of cookies by EuroDNS for the provision of its services.</strong>\n</p>About cookies<p>Web cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to the users' device when they browse a website.\nCookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit.\nCookies allow websites to recognize the user's device.</p>EuroDNS Website uses two types of cookies.1.\nSession cookies<p>These are temporary cookies, which only exist for the period a&nbsp;User accesses the&nbsp;EuroDNS Website and which are automatically deleted from the User's device at the end of each visit.</p>\n<p>Session cookies enable the&nbsp;EuroDNS Website to keep track of the Users' movements within the EuroDNS Website and prevent Users from being asked for the same information endlessly.</p>\n<p>\n<br>For example, when a&nbsp;User selects and adds services to its shopping cart, the session cookie remembers the User's selection and keeps the selected items in the shopping cart until the User is ready to check out.\nWithout session cookies, the User's services selection could not be registered and the shopping cart would always remain empty.</p>2.\nPersistent cookies<p>These are cookies which remain on the User's device for a limited period of time after the User's visit to&nbsp;the&nbsp;EuroDNS website.\nThe EuroDNS&nbsp;Website uses three types of persistent cookies.</p>2.1.\nPersonalisation cookies<p>Personalisation cookies enable the&nbsp;EuroDNS Website to remember the User's preferences for their next visit.\nFor example, on the User's first visit to the&nbsp;EuroDNS Website, the language will be set to English and the currency to Euros by default.\nIf the User selects another language and/or currency during this visit, the personalisation cookie will store this information on the User's device and the&nbsp;EuroDNS Website will automatically be presented to the User in its preferred language and currency during their subsequent visit.</p>2.2.\nPerformance cookies<p>Performance cookies are used to improve the EuroDNS Website navigation and security by analysing anonymised information about the User such as their browser type, browser plugins version, operating system, ...</p>\n<p>For example, if the information registered by the Performance cookies reveals that a great number of users are relying on a browser not compatible with a EuroDNS Website functionality, EuroDNS will adapt this functionality to make it compatible with such browser.\nThe EuroDNS Website uses the Google Analytics Cookie for this purpose.</p>2.3.\nRetargeting cookies<p>Retargeting cookies are used to serve ads specific to the User and their interests.\nThe ads served will be targeted based on the User's browsing history.\nFor example, if the User has visited the EuroDNS Website without realising a purchase of services, the User may see EuroDNS advertisements when visiting a non-related site.</p>\n<p>Retargeting cookies use non-personally identifiable information and don't track personal information about the User.\nThe EuroDNS Website uses the DoubleClick DART Cookie for this purpose.</p>Managing cookies<p>By enabling cookies the User will receive the optimal experience from the&nbsp;EuroDNS Website.\nNevertheless, it shall be the User's sole choice to accept their use.\nThe User is duly informed that by blocking all cookies they won't be able to purchase any service from EuroDNS and some part of the Website may become inaccessible.</p>Cookies and browser settings<p>The Help feature on most browsers details the procedure to prevent the use and acceptation of cookies.\nMore information about the management of cookies can also be found on the applicable browser manufacturer website.\nAdditionally, the User may also opt-out of retargeting cookies used by EuroDNS by installing the tool available at this address:&nbsp;https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</p>", "created_at": "2023-05-14 03:45:20.902382", "updated_at": "2023-05-14 03:46:41.07427"}, {"id": 16104, "name": "Terms", "url":
