COLLECTED PERSONAL DATA <br>\n<br> 2.1.\nCreating your account When the Visitors of our Website sign-up for a ShortPixel account, we collect their email, their IP address and store the new generated API keys.\n<br> The legal ground for this Processing is the performance of a contract, in accordance with Art.\n6 (1) b) GDPR.\n<br>\n<br> 2.2.\nRunning the Services We Process the Personal Data for taking the necessary actions to offer our Customers the Company\u2019s products (e.g.\nfor the proper running of our Web Hosting service and of our image optimization service, to connect our servers to our Customers\u2019 servers, where the images needing compression are hosted, for maintenance and for building appropriate tools for our clients, etc.), pursuant to Art.\n6 (1) b) GDPR, for the performance of a contract and Art.\n6 (1) f) GDPR, on the basis of our legitimate interest.<br> From the Users of our WordPress plugins and from those who use our API tools, we Process the following Personal Data: name and surname, identification data, email, processed images and CDN traffic data.\n<br> From the Customers of Web Hosting service we Process the following Personal Data: name and surname, identification data, email, domain name.<br> We also process data regarding the browser, IP address, timestamp, IP location and also operating system when you access ShortPixel Hosting or any web site that is owned by ShortPixel.<br> All the information that is so collected is used for secure logging &amp.\nwebsite data analytics and preventing fraud.<br>\n<br>\n<br> 2.2.1.\nGoogle Drive optimization app<br> This service is curently in beta testing.<br> We offer our users the possibilty to optimize their images stored in Google Drive, from their personal space on our website.<br> In order to optimize these images, the user needs to create an account with ShortPixel.com.\nThen the ShortPixel website Google Drive optimization application needs to be allowed access to the users Google Drive in order to view, download, upload, modify, add files as a different file type at your request or overwrite files.<br> In order to aquire this permission, upon the first usage, the logged-in ShortPixel user will be asked to connect their account to the Google Drive Account, using Google OAuth 2.0 (note that the email used to register the ShortPixel account can be different from the one of the Google Account).<br> Since optimization may take a while, the app needs offline access to your Google Drive Account, and, as consequence, it requests your consent for Refresh Token, which allows the app to continuously access your Google Drive Account while you are not present in the app.\nAfter the authorization, ShortPixel will only store the Refresh Token (provided by Google OAuth 2.0) in order to communicate with Google OAuth 2.0 and access users files from Google Drive.<br> After user grants access to the application, the user can browse the content of their Google Drive from their private space on ShortPixel.com and select the folder for optimization by using the contextual menu of the app.\nWhen the user selects a folder for optimization, the name and ID of that folder are stored in the ShortPixel's optimization queue to be processed in the background.<br> Upon optimization, the application first downloads the content of the Google Drive folder to the ShortPixel servers, filtered by accepted file types and starts optimizing them.\n\"Filtered by accepted file types\" means only files of the following types will be downloaded: JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, PDF.\nAfter the optimization is complete on ShortPixel's cloud, the application uploads the optimized files back to Google Drive, overwriting the old files or adding it as a different file type at your request.\nFiles are then deleted from ShortPixel servers and the user receives an email - at their address from their ShortPixel account - letting them know that the optimization is done.<br> The statistics of the folder optimization (folder name, number of files - total, optimized, already optimal, failed - and the optimization percent) are kept in ShortPixel's database and used for future reference.<br> Please be aware that Refresh Token allows the app to continuously access your Google Drive Account while you are not present in the app and it expires after 6 months.\nIf you don\u2019t want to permit the app to access your Google Drive after optimization, you must revoke the access here or delete your ShortPixel account.<br>\n<br> 2.3.\nCustomer Support The Personal Data is also Processed for offering support to Customers, at their request, pursuant to Art.\n6 (1) b) GDPR for the performance of a contract and to Art.\n6 (1) f) GDPR, on the basis of our legitimate interest.\nIn order to help our Customers, we need to use their Personal Data for user identification, for debugging reasons and in order to communicate with the Customers that need assistance.\nFor this purpose, we use a feature called Beacons for helping the Users of our ShortPixel services.\nThis feature is made by HelpScout, a Third Party service provider we use for customer support.\nThrough

useful for our Users.\nWe try to keep these types of messages at a maximum of two emails per user/ each month.\n<br>\n<br> The legal basis for this Processing is your consent, according to Art.\n6 (a) GDPR and your legitimate interest, in accordance with Art.\n6 (f) GDPR.\n<br>\n<br> If you no longer wish to receive the Company's promotional communications, you may \"opt-out\" from receiving them
