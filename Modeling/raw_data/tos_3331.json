apply to us under that Act).\nHowever, due to the nature of some of our business activities, from time to time, we will handle personal information relying on the media exemption in the Act where appropriate.\nWhere we do so, we will ensure that we comply with the Australian Press Council Privacy Standards.\nWe may also rely on related bodies corporate, employee records and other exemptions in the Act.\nIf you require more information on the collection and use of personal information in the course of journalism, please visit the Australian Press Council Privacy Standards at www.presscouncil.org.au/privacy-principles.</p>\n<p>We may, from time to time, review and update this policy, including taking account of new or amended laws, new technology and/or changes to our operations.\nAll personal information held by us will be governed by the most recent updated policy.\nYour privacy matters to us, so whether you are new to Fairfax or are a long time user, please take the time to get to know our practices.</p>What is Personal Information<p>When used in this policy, the term \u201cpersonal information\u201d has the meaning given to it in the Act.\nIn general terms, it is any information that can be used to personally identify you.\nThis may include (but is not limited to) your name, age, gender, postcode and contact details (including phone numbers and email addresses) and possibly financial information, including your credit card, direct debit or PayPal account information.\nIf the information we collect personally identifies you, or you are reasonably identifiable from it, the information will be considered personal information.</p>What Personal Information Do We Collect and Hold<p>We may collect the following types of personal

below).</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Promotions<ol>\n<li>If you subscribe as part of one of our special promotions or offers then the specific terms and conditions of that promotion or offer will also apply - if any of the promotion terms and conditions conflict with these terms and conditions then these terms and conditions will override the promotion terms and conditions.</li>\n<li>You will likely be required to provide your direct debit/credit card payment details when you sign up for a promotion or offer and your subscription will then renew automatically at the end of the promotional period at the standard subscription price unless you cancel.</li>\n<li>If we cancel your promotional subscription for any reason (e.g.\nnon-payment), you may not be able to later re-subscribe at the same promotional price.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Managing your subscription<ol>\n<li>You can manage your account, change your personal details or your payment plan and upgrade/downgrade your subscription online in the \u2018My Account\u2019 or \u2018Support Centre\u2019 section of our websites or by contacting the customer service team for help.</li>\n<li>Upgrades are billed from your next billing cycle but you will get immediate access to the upgraded digital product.\nDowngrades of print and digital products will take effect from your next billing cycle.\nIf you have a print product, we will need up to 10 working days to make the change to your home delivery.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Suspending or redirecting print<ol>\n<li>You can activate a suspension of your home delivery print product for up to 60 continuous days via the \u2018My Account\u2019 or the \u2018Support Centre\u2019 section of our websites or by contacting our customer service team for help.\nWe need at least 3 business days\u2019 notice to effect the suspension.\nWhen you suspend your home delivery, we will grant you an extension of your subscription renewal date or a credit on your account after the suspension period has ended.\nIf you have digital access as part of your subscription this will still be available to you during the suspension period at no extra cost.\nYou cannot suspend a digital only subscription.</li>\n<li>If you wish to modify your delivery suspension, you can do so at any time by contacting the customer service team or by visiting the Support Centre section of our website.</li>\n<li>If you wish to redirect your home delivery to a new address in our deliverable area, you should contact our customer service team.\nWe will need at least 5 working days to effect this redirection.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Cancelling your subscription<ol>\n<li>You can request cancellation of your subscription by contacting our customer service team.\nCancellation won\u2019t be effective until we have received all relevant information from you and until the end of your current billing cycle (note that your cancellation request must be made at least 72 hours before your next subscription payment is due).</li>\n<li>If you ordered your print and/or digital subscription via our telemarketing channels then you have the right to cancel via contacting our customer service team within 10 business days from the subscription start date.\nThese 10 business days are your cooling off period.</li>\n<li>If you cancel an annual prepaid subscription, you may be entitled to a prorated refund if there is more than one month left on your prepaid subscription.</li>\n<li>We can cancel or suspend your subscription at any time at our discretion but we will act reasonably.\nIf we cancel your subscription, we may give you a prorated refund if you have pre-paid your subscription.</li>\n<li>We will not refund past subscription payments if you have not contacted our customer service team directly to cancel your subscription.\nWe also will not refund past subscription payments if you do not contact our customer service team to report unexpected deductions from your bank account within 3 months of the deduction.</li>\n<li>We are not responsible for any missed or unwanted deliveries or any unexpected charges resulting from requests made by you to any newsagency or other third party rather than directly to our customer service team.</li>\n<li>It should be noted that opting out of receiving newsletters or any other email communication otherwise related to your subscription will not constitute cancellation of your subscription.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Newspaper delivery terms (print)<ol>\n<li>Subscriptions that include a print product for home (or office) delivery are only possible within our standard delivery area.\nIt should be noted that these standard delivery areas do not extend out of state i.e.\nThe Age is only delivered in certain parts of Victoria, The Sydney Morning Herald in certain parts of NSW and the ACT and the AFR in certain parts of Australia.\nFor more information, contact our customer service team.</li>\n<li>Delivery to addresses in our standard delivery area that are located in apartments, office buildings, retirement and aged care facilities will depend on whether we have distribution available to service the relevant address.\nWe will notify you of any discontinuance of your delivery where we no longer have distribution available to your address or if distribution to your address is considered difficult by our delivery service providers.\nIf we discontinue delivery to you for this reason, we will give you a prorated refund of any prepaid subscription fees where services will not be provided.</li>\n<li>Some subscribers may not receive various inserts and magazines that form part of our print products due to logistical or other limitations, particularly in non-metropolitan areas.\nWe will not provide any refund for this.</li>\n<li>While we will use reasonable commercial efforts to ensure the delivery of all subscribed print products to your nominated delivery address on the applicable day/s each week as nominated by you in your subscription, we expressly make no guarantees as to the timeframe within which such print product/s will be delivered to you on those day/s and consequently have no liability to refund you unless clause 8.5 applies.</li>\n<li>If you notify us that your print product has not been delivered within 3 days of the missed delivery date and we can verify this, we will credit your account for the day(s) that your print product was not delivered.\nWe can provide this credit by extending your subscription term by the equivalent number of days or by giving you a pro-rata credit on your next subscription payment (at our option).</li>\n<li>It is your responsibility to report any deliveries of newspapers that you receive, or any subscription payments that continue to be deducted, after you have cancelled your subscription to the customer service team.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Privacy<ol>\n<li>You acknowledge and agree that certain personal information (which may include your
