credit/refund/compensation if there is a difference between the value of the Coupon and the redeemed value;</li>\n<li>The Coupon is intended solely for non\u2013commercial use.\nAny reproduction, counterfeiting and commercial trade of the Coupon is strictly forbidden, along with any illegal activity related to the purchase and/or use of the Coupon.</li>\n</ul>Methods of payment#<p>Information related to accepted payment methods are made available during the purchasing process.</p>\n<p>Some payment methods may only be available subject to additional conditions or fees.\nIn such cases related information can be found in the dedicated section of Gentlent.</p>\n<p>Payment methods marked accordingly are managed directly by the Owner.\nIn this case, the Owner collects and stores the data necessary for the processing of payments and for fulfilling any legal obligation related to them.\nThe User may read the privacy policy of Gentlent to learn more about the data processing and Users\u2019 rights regarding their data.</p>\n<p>Other payment methods \u2013 if any \u2013 are independently provided by third-party services.\nIn such cases Gentlent collects no payment information \u2013 such as credit card details \u2013 but only receives a notification from the relevant third-party provider once the payment has been successfully completed.</p>\n<p>If payment through the available methods fail, the Owner shall be under no obligation to fulfil the purchase order.\nAny possible costs or fees resulting from the failed or refused payment shall be borne by the User.</p>Authorization for future PayPal payment#<p>If Users authorize the PayPal feature which allows future purchases, Gentlent will store an identification code linked to the Users\u2019 PayPal account.\nThis will authorize Gentlent to automatically process payments for future purchases or recurring installments of past purchases.</p>\n<p>This authorization can be revoked at any time, either by contacting the Owner or by changing the user settings offered by PayPal.</p>Purchase via app store#<p>Gentlent or specific Products available for sale on Gentlent must be purchased via a third-party app store.\nTo access such purchases, Users must follow the instructions provided on the relevant online store (such as \"Apple App Store\" or \"Google Play\"), which may vary depending on the particular device in use.</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise specified, purchases done via third-party online stores are also subject to such third-parties\u2019 terms and conditions, which, in case of any inconsistency or conflict, shall always prevail upon these Terms.</p>\n<p>Users purchasing through such third-party online stores must therefore read such terms and conditions of sale carefully and accept them.</p>Retention of Product ownership#<p>Until payment of the total purchase price is received by the Owner, any Products ordered shall not become the User\u2019s property.</p>Retention of usage rights#<p>Users do not acquire any rights to use the purchased Product until the total purchase price is received by the Owner.</p>Delivery#Delivery of digital content#<p>Unless otherwise

accept that the ability to download the purchased Product may be limited in time and space.</p>Performance of services#<p>The purchased service shall be performed or made available within the timeframe specified on Gentlent or as communicated before the order submission.</p>Contract duration#Trial period#<p>Users have the option to test Gentlent or selected Products during a limited and non-renewable trial period, at no cost.\nSome features or functions of Gentlent may not be available to Users during the trial period.<br>Further conditions applicable to the trial period, including its duration, will be specified on Gentlent.</p>\n<p>The trial period shall end automatically and shall not convert into any paid Product unless the User actively purchases such paid Product.</p>Subscriptions#<p>Subscriptions allow Users to receive a Product continuously or regularly over time.\nDetails regarding the type of subscription and termination are outlined below.</p>Fixed-term subscriptions#<p>Paid fixed-term subscriptions start on the day the payment is received by the Owner and last for the subscription period chosen by the User or otherwise specified during the purchasing process.</p>\n<p>Once the subscription period expires, the Product shall no longer be accessible.</p>Subscriptions handled via Apple ID#<p>Users may subscribe to a Product using the Apple ID associated with their Apple App Store account by using the relevant process on Gentlent.\nWhen doing so, Users acknowledge and accept that</p>\n<ul>\n<li>any payment due shall be charged to their Apple ID account;</li>\n<li>subscriptions are automatically renewed for the same duration unless the User cancels at least 24 hours before the current period expires;</li>\n<li>any and all fees or payments due for renewal will be charged within 24-hours before the end of the current period;</li>\n<li>subscriptions can be managed or cancelled in the Users\u2019 Apple App Store account settings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above shall prevail upon any conflicting or diverging provision of these Terms.</p>Automatic renewal of fixed-term subscriptions#<p>\n<strong>Subscriptions are automatically renewed through the payment method that the User chose during purchase.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The renewed subscription will last for a period equal to the original term.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The User shall receive a reminder of the upcoming renewal with reasonable advance, outlining the procedure to be followed in order to cancel the automatic renewal.</p>Termination#<p>\n<strong>Subscriptions may be terminated by sending a clear and unambiguous termination notice to the Owner using the contact details provided in this document, or \u2014 if applicable \u2014 by using the corresponding controls inside Gentlent.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>If the notice of termination is received by the Owner before the subscription renews, the termination shall take effect as soon as the current period is completed.</strong>\n</p>Terms and conditions applying to extra features#<p>Users that have an active subscription may purchase single extra add-ons or features, described in the relevant section of Gentlent.<br>Prices, duration, terms of use and termination of such extras may differ from those of the main Product and, unless otherwise specified, do not influence the prices, duration, terms of use and termination of the latter.</p>Exception for Consumers based in Germany#<p>However, regardless of the above, if the User is based in Germany and qualifies as a Consumer, the following applies:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>At the end of the initial term, subscriptions are automatically extended for an unlimited period, unless the User terminates before the end of such term.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The fee due upon extension will be charged on the payment method that the User chose during purchase.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>After extension, the subscription will last for an indefinite period and may be terminated monthly.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The User shall receive a reminder of the upcoming unlimited extension with reasonable advance, outlining the procedure to be followed in order to prevent the extension or terminate the subscription thereafter.</p>Termination#<p>\n<strong>Extended subscriptions may be terminated at any time by sending a clear and unambiguous termination notice to the Owner using the contact details provided in this document, or \u2014 if applicable \u2014 by using the corresponding controls inside Gentlent.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>If the notice of termination is received by the Owner by the end of the current month, the subscription shall expire at the end of such month.</strong>\n</p>User rights#Right of withdrawal#<p>Unless exceptions apply, the User may be eligible to withdraw from the contract within the period specified below (generally 14 days), for any reason and without justification.\nUsers can learn more about the withdrawal conditions within this section.</p>Who the right of withdrawal applies to#<p>The right of withdrawal is a right designed for European Consumers in the case of distance contracts (because the User is not able to see or try the Products before closing the contract).\nWithdrawal from the contract terminates the obligation of the contracting parties to perform the contract.</p>\n<p>On Gentlent the right of withdrawal applies to all Consumers, regardless of where they are based.</p>\n<p>Unless any exception mentioned below applies, if any, Users who are Consumers have a right to withdraw from the contract within the specified period applicable to their case, for any reason and without justification.</p>\n<p>Users that do not fit this qualification, cannot benefit from the rights described in this section.</p>Exercising the right of withdrawal#<p>To exercise their right of withdrawal, Users must send to the Owner an unequivocal statement of their intention to withdraw from the contract.</p>\n<p>To this end, Users may use the model withdrawal form available from within the \u201cdefinitions\u201d section of this document.\nUsers are, however, free to express their intention to withdraw from the contract by making an unequivocal statement in any other suitable way.\nIn order to meet the deadline within which they can exercise such right, Users must send the withdrawal notice before the withdrawal period expires.</p>\n<p>When does the withdrawal period expire?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Regarding the purchase of a service</strong>, the withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day that the contract is entered into, unless the User has waived the withdrawal right.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>In case of purchase of a digital content not supplied in a tangible medium</strong>, the withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day that the contract is entered into, unless the User has waived the withdrawal right.</li>\n</ul>Effects of withdrawal#<p>Users who correctly withdraw from a contract will be reimbursed by the Owner for all payments made to the Owner, including, if any, those covering the costs of delivery.</p>\n<p>However, any additional costs resulting from the choice of a particular delivery method other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by the Owner, will not be reimbursed.</p>\n<p>Such reimbursement shall be made without undue delay and, in any event, no later than 14 days from the day on which the Owner is informed of the User\u2019s decision to withdraw from the contract.\nUnless otherwise agreed with the User, reimbursements will be made using the same means of payment as used to process the initial transaction.\nIn any event, the User shall not incur any costs or fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p>\u2026on the purchase of services#<p>Where a User exercises the right of withdrawal after having requested that the service be performed before the withdrawal period expires, the User shall pay to the Owner an amount which is in proportion to the part of service provided.</p>\n<p>Such payment shall be calculated based on the fee contractually agreed upon, and be proportional to the part of service provided until the time the User withdraws, compared with the full coverage of the contract.</p>Exceptions from the right of withdrawal#<p>The right of withdrawal does not apply to contracts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>for the supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium if the performance has begun with the consumer\u2019s prior express consent and with their acknowledgment that their right of withdrawal is thereby lost;</li>\n<li>concluded at a public auction.</li>\n<li>for the provision of services, after the service has been fully performed if the performance has begun with the consumer\u2019s prior express consent, and with their acknowledgement that their right of withdrawal is lost once the contract has been fully performed;</li>\n</ul>Liability and indemnification#EU Users#Indemnification#<p>The User agrees to indemnify and hold the Owner and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners and employees harmless from and against any claim or demand \u2060\u2014 including but not limited to lawyer's fees and costs \u2060\u2014 made by any third party due to or in relation with any culpable use of or connection to the Service, violation of these Terms, infringement of any third-party rights or statutory provision by the User or its affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners and employees to the extent allowed by applicable law.</p>Limitation of liability#<p>Unless otherwise explicitly stated and without prejudice to applicable statutory product liability provisions, Users shall have no right to claim damages against the Owner (or any natural or legal person acting on its behalf).</p>\n<p>This does not apply to damages to life, health or physical integrity, damages resulting from the breach of an essential contractual obligation such as any obligation strictly necessary to achieve the purpose of the contract, and/or damages resulting from intent or gross negligence, as long as Gentlent has been appropriately and correctly used by the User.</p>\n<p>Unless damages have been caused by way of intent or gross negligence, or they affect life, health or physical integrity, the Owner shall only be liable to the extent of typical and foreseeable damages at the moment the contract was entered into.</p>\n<p>In particular, within the limits stated above, the Owner shall not be liable for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>any loss of business opportunities and any other loss, even indirect, that may be incurred by the User (such as, but not limited to, trading losses, loss of revenue, income, profits or anticipated savings, loss of contracts or business relationships, loss of reputation or goodwill, etc.);</li>\n<li>damages or losses resulting from interruptions or malfunctions of Gentlent due to acts of force majeure, or unforeseen and unforeseeable events and, in any case, independent of the will and beyond the control of the Owner, such as, but not limited to, failures or disruptions of telephone or electrical lines, the Internet and / or other means of transmission, unavailability of websites, strikes, natural disasters, viruses and cyber attacks, interruptions in the delivery of products, third-party services or applications;</li>\n<li>any losses that are not the direct consequence of a breach of the Terms by the Owner;</li>\n<li>any damage, prejudice or loss occurring due to viruses or other malware contained in or connected to files available for download from the internet or via Gentlent.\nUsers are responsible for implementing sufficient security measures \u2013 such as anti-viruses and firewalls to prevent any such infection or attack and for securing backup copies of all data or information exchanged via or uploaded to Gentlent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notwithstanding the above, the following limitation applies to all Users not qualifying as Consumers:</p>\n<p>In any event of liability, the compensation may not exceed the total payments that have been, will be or would be received by the Owner from the User based on the contract over a period of 12 months, or the period of the duration of the Agreement, if shorter.</p>Australian Users#Limitation of

informs Users about the technologies that help Gentlent to achieve the purposes described below.\nSuch technologies allow the Owner to access and store information (for example by using a Cookie) or use resources (for example by running a script) on a User\u2019s device as they interact with Gentlent.</p>\n<p>For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as \"Trackers\" within this document \u2013 unless there is a reason to differentiate.<br>For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be inaccurate to talk about Cookies in the context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker.\nFor this reason, within this document, the term Cookies is only used where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type of Tracker.</p>\n<p>Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require the User's consent.\nWhenever consent is given, it can be freely withdrawn at any time following the instructions provided in this document.</p>\n<p>Gentlent uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner (so-called \u201cfirst-party\u201d Trackers) and Trackers that enable services provided by a third-party (so-called \u201cthird-party\u201d Trackers).\nUnless otherwise specified within this document, third-party providers may access the Trackers managed by them.<br>The validity and expiration periods of Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary depending on the lifetime set by the Owner or the relevant provider.\nSome of them expire upon termination of the User\u2019s browsing session.<br>In addition to what\u2019s specified in the descriptions within each of the categories below, Users may find more precise and updated information regarding lifetime specification as well as any other relevant information \u2013 such as the presence of other Trackers - in the linked privacy policies of the respective third-party providers or by contacting the Owner.</p>\n<p>To find more information dedicated to Californian consumers and their privacy rights, Users may read the privacy policy.Show the complete Privacy Policy</p>Activities strictly necessary for the operation of Gentlent and

consent, where relevant:</p>\n<p>Users can manage preferences related to Trackers from directly within their own device settings, for example, by preventing the use or storage of Trackers.</p>\n<p>Additionally, whenever the use of Trackers is based on consent, Users can provide or withdraw such consent by setting their preferences within the cookie notice or by updating such preferences accordingly via the relevant consent-preferences widget, if available.</p>\n<p>It is also possible, via relevant browser or device features, to delete previously stored Trackers, including those used to remember the User\u2019s initial consent.</p>\n<p>Other Trackers in the browser\u2019s local memory may be cleared by deleting the browsing history.</p>\n<p>With regard to any third-party Trackers, Users can manage their preferences and withdraw their consent via the related opt-out link (where provided), by using the means indicated in the third party's privacy policy, or by contacting the third party.</p>Locating Tracker Settings#<p>Users can, for example, find information about how to manage Cookies in the most commonly used browsers at the following addresses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Chrome</li>\n<li>Mozilla Firefox</li>\n<li>Apple Safari</li>\n<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer</li>\n<li>Microsoft Edge</li>\n<li>Brave</li>\n<li>Opera</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Users may also manage certain categories of Trackers used on mobile apps by opting out through relevant device settings such as the device advertising settings for mobile devices, or tracking settings in general (Users may open the device settings and look for the relevant setting).</p>How to opt out of interest-based advertising#<p>Notwithstanding the above, Users may follow the instructions provided by YourOnlineChoices (EU), the Network Advertising Initiative (US) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (US), DAAC (Canada), DDAI (Japan) or other similar services.\nSuch initiatives allow Users to select their tracking preferences for most of the advertising tools.\nThe Owner thus recommends that Users make use of these resources in addition to the information provided in this document.</p>\n<p>The Digital Advertising Alliance offers an application called AppChoices that helps Users to control interest-based advertising on mobile apps.</p>Owner and Data Controller#<p>Gentlent, Inc.<br>16192 Coastal Highway<br>Lewes, DE 19958<br>United States<br>\n<br>You can find our contact details on

of Conduct<p>Our code of conduct is used to ensure the right values and optimal behavior of our company.</p>Similar Resources<p>Terms of Service </p>\n<p>Privacy Policy </p>\n<p>Cookie Policy </p>\n<p>Code of Conduct </p>\n<p>Back to top \u2191</p>\n<p>\n<i>Last updated: March 15, 2020</i>\n</p>\n<p>Our code of conduct is used to ensure the right values and optimal behavior of our company in connection with the internal dealings as well as with the business conduct with clients and partners.\nThese values convey high standards to enable our company to meet its own requirements and goals.\nBy adhering to this behavior, we create a grandiose relationship between everyone involved in our business which is necessary for a pleasant working environment and a successful future.</p>\n<p>Whether as an employee, contractor or business partner, everyone should make sure to internalize this code of conduct to guarantee to optimally apply it.\nIt is a good base for business-related dealings.</p>To Whom Does the Code Apply?<p>The code of conduct applies to all employees and partners who directly or indirectly act on Gentlent\u2018s behalf.\nAnyone who does not represent Gentlent in compliance with the code of conduct runs the risk of disciplinary proceedings against himself and his position and/or termination of the cooperation.</p>Questions, Ambiguities, and Other Issues<p>If you have any questions, ambiguities or other matters relating to the Code, please consult a responsible person such as the department head, who then takes care of the matter or, under certain circumstances, also escalates it to the next higher authority.\nIn the event of abuse or non-compliance with the code of conduct, it is of great importance not to quietly accept the situation, but to make yourself strong and to represent the values of the company and act in its will.</p>1.\nSatisfied Customers are Good Customers<p>As a representative of the Gentlent brand, we should always try to satisfy our customers in the interests of the company.\nIn order to guarantee the desired standards in our company, we have to serve and stand up for the customer.</p>1.1 Trust and Security are Crucial<p>We want our users to trust us with their data, which is why we have to respect their personal privacy and treat their data with the utmost confidentiality.\nThrough our behavior, we want to offer the customer a sense of security and ideally implement their wishes in the most efficient way.\nPersonal data is regulated by our security system to prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to and misusing confidential information or harming the company.\nAs an authorized person, personal data and information should always be handled with care and consciousness.</p>1.2 Satisfy the Customer<p>If our users are not treated best with values, we endanger Gentlent\u2018s reputation.\nIt is necessary to take care of our clients and satisfy their needs.\nWe demand to be open-minded and to take care of the customer regardless of whether he has a question, a problem, a compliment or feedback and to support him in his concern.</p>2.\nConfidentiality of Data<p>All types of data that are collected in internal processes or procedures and are used there must be treated confidentially and not be discussed or passed to third parties if not otherwise stated.\nInformation, from e.g.\nleaking company secrets to the public, can harm the company and may create a critical issue that can create unnecessary risks and consequences.\nIf you have issues with work processes, task assignments, the fulfillment of obligations, etc., you should contact a responsible person and never ever bring internal problems to the public nor act in a manner that is detrimental to the business and/or everything related.</p>3.\nAt the Workplace<p>In well-regulated everyday work, it is necessary to support each other and, if possible, to assist each other.\nEveryone acting on our behalf should always aim at a positive and good work ethic, which we highly encourage to participate in.\nEveryone should try to solve their problems with regard to the values of the company or seek help and advice from the leading authority.\nThere is no place in the company for exclusion, bullying, racism, sexism or any kind of other discrimination based on gender, origin, color, language, belief, religion and political outlook.\nIf there is a case in which someone shows such behavior, those involved, witnesses and victims should immediately contact the next higher authority and describe the incident to initiate further action.</p>3.1 Equality and Equal Opportunities<p>In our company, individuality is not just welcome but embraced.\nEveryone should contribute according to their qualifications and skills and thus reflect their own competencies in their tasks in the best possible way.\nEveryone deserves respect in any form and does not deserve to be a victim of exclusion, insult or any form of harassment.\nThe only decisive thing for us as a company is the way and personal willingness to work for the common goals of Gentlent and to represent the company with dignity and according to its values.</p>3.2 Drugs and Other Substances<p>As a company, we consider the misuse of substances such as drugs to be an obstacle to a good working atmosphere and do not support it.\nMisconduct in the workplace due to this consumption is not tolerated and can lead to disciplinary proceedings, which can result in the termination of employment relationships, partner contracts or the like.\nIn the event of a reasonable suspicion that the work performance or behavior is being affected by substances, drug screenings may be initiated.</p>3.3 Safety at work<p>Everyone should enable a non-violent work environment.\nIf a risk to safety at work is noticed, you should inform a responsible authority immediately to initiate further procedures.\nUnauthorized use of weapons is strictly prohibited and is a violation of safety in the workplace.</p>4.\nConflicts of Interest<p>Never use the information and the like for you, your friends, or your relatives\u2018 benefit.\nThis could create disadvantages at the company\u2018s expense, which is intolerable.\nWhen choosing the right approach to problems, you should always keep an eye on whether you are creating an incentive for yourself or others to benefit or to appear to do so in a conflicting way.\nAvoid creating a conflict of interest and counteract it.\nIf you are already in a situation that can potentially create a conflict of interest, a solution should be found together with a responsible authority or higher authority.\nUnder certain circumstances, conflicts of interest may arise over time and thus can not be consciously avoided or counteracted right from the beginning, which should not be neglected.</p>4.1 Investments<p>In order to promote the company as much as possible and not to harm Gentlent as a company, one should avoid investing in competing companies and thus promote them.\nNor is it justifiable to use information, one\u2018s own position or other companies\u2018 internals for potential competitors, outsiders, etc., which would also create a conflict of interest.</p>4.2 Second Jobs or Your Own Business<p>Support from competing companies and behavior harmful to the company should be prevented.\nWhen entering a board or a position at another company or organization that could create a conflict of interest, this decision should be discussed with a manager in advance.\nYou should not start a business that competes with Gentlent without prior discussion.\nHowever, we do have processes in place to encourage and even support the start of certain innovative businesses if discussed prior to the management.</p>4.3 Gifts and Other Courtesies<p>In general, gifts and other niceties from competitors or business partners with monetary value or the like are not permitted without permission as they could cause a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest.\nGifts with a non-monetary or negligible value are largely permitted as long as no conflict of interest or the like is created.</p>5.\nLaws &amp.\nLegal<p>In order not to act harmful to Gentlent, you should always act in accordance with applicable law and not against them.\nEvery representative of ours acts as a figurehead in public and accordingly should represent it with dignity.\nWhile working in general, at the office, at trade fairs, in public, and elsewhere, you should never violate any applicable laws, if it is in direct or indirect connection with Gentlent or a representative of the company.</p>6.\nSummary<p>Basically, the Code of Conduct is an appeal to the fundamentally correct values in people, which should be represented with a good heart in order to represent the image of Gentlent with dignity.\nAny kind of information, regardless of whether processes, customer data, trade secrets, etc., affect Gentlent should be treated as confidential as possible and with respect for privacy and dignity and should not be passed on to third parties.\nThe workplace should be a safe place, without violence, harassment or anything harmful, in order to maintain a good working atmosphere by making everyone feel comfortable and efficient.</p>Got your interest?Get notified or invited to our beta as soon as Gentlent opens its doors: Press Enter or click to join waitlist Resources Code of
