YOU AND TEMU WILL BE RESOLVED.\nAMONG OTHER THINGS, THIS SECTION 20 INCLUDES AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, WHICH REQUIRES, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND TEMU BE RESOLVED BY BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION.\nTHIS SECTION 20 ALSO CONTAINS A CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER.\nIN SOME COUNTRIES YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS AND/OR ELEMENTS OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU AS REQUIRED BY LAW.\n<p>20.1.\nApplicability of Arbitration Agreement.\nSubject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Temu agree that any dispute, claim, or disagreement arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Services, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Services, or the Terms, including claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of the Terms (each, a \u201cDispute\u201d) will be resolved by binding arbitration, using the English language, rather than in court, except that: (1) you and Temu may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court.\nand (2) you or Temu may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).\nFor purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, \u201cDispute\u201d will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of the Terms as well as claims that may arise after the termination of the Terms.</p>\n<p>20.2.\nInformal Dispute Resolution.\nThere may be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Temu.\nIf that occurs, Temu is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution.\nYou and Temu agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low\u2010cost and mutually beneficial outcome.\nYou and Temu therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Conference\u201d).\nIf you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you also agree to participate in the conference.\nThe party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (\u201cNotice\u201d), which shall occur within forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties in writing.\nNotice to Temu that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to dispute@temu.com for the U.S., dispute@eur.temu.com for the EU, or dispute@uk.temu.com for the UK, or by regular mail to the applicable address set forth in Section 19.7.\nThe Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e\u2010mail address associated with your account (if you have one).\n(2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e\u2010mail address of your counsel, if any.\nand (3) a description of your Dispute.</p>The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree.\nmultiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree.\nIn the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party\u2019s Dispute.\nEngaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration.\nThe statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.<p>20.3.\nWaiver of Jury Trial.\nYOU AND TEMU HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.\nYou and Temu are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 20.1 above.\nThere is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p>\n<p>20.4.\nWaiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief.\nYOU AND TEMU AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 20.9, EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS.\nONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.\nSubject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party's individual claim.\nNothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 20.9.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this Section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Temu agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated only in the courts provided for under Section 19.5.\nAll other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court.\nThis subsection does not prevent you or Temu from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.</p>\n<p>20.5.\nRules and Forum.\nThe Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce.\nand notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings.\nIf the Informal Dispute Resolution Process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of Notice, you and Temu agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by American Arbitration Association (the \u201cAAA\u201d), an established alternative dispute resolution provider, under its rules, including Consumer Arbitration Rules (the \u201cAAA Rules\u201d), then effect, unless otherwise required by law.\nAAA\u2019s rules are also available at https://adr.org/consumer, or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nFor all actions under the AAA Rules, the proceedings may be filed where your residence is, or in New York, New York, and any in-person hearings will be conducted at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties taking into account their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.\nIf AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.\nYour responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely as set forth in the applicable AAA rules.</p>A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the \u201cRequest\u201d).\nThe Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e\u2010mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account.\n(2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims.\n(3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good\u2010faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States Dollars.\n(4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above.\nand (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel\u2019s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address.\nSuch counsel must also sign the Request.\nBy signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel\u2019s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution.\n(2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law.\nand (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.Unless you and Temu otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 20.9 is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.\nSubject to the applicable AAA rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.You and Temu agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties\u2019 attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and then subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.<p>20.6.\nArbitrator.\nThe arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of New York, and will be selected by the parties from the AAA roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.\nIf the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the applicable AAA rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under Section 20.9 is triggered, AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.</p>\n<p>20.7.\nAuthority of Arbitrator.\nThe arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to Section 20.4, including any claim that all or part of Section 20.4 is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that Section 20.4 has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.\n(2) except as expressly contemplated in Section 20.9, all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.\n(3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.\nand (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.\nThe arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in Section 20.9.\nThe arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute.\nThe arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.\nThe award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.\nJudgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>20.8.\nAttorneys\u2019 Fees and Costs.\nThe parties shall bear their own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).\nIf you or Temu need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration.\nThe prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution Process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p>20.9.\nBatch Arbitration.\nTo increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Temu agree that in the event that there are one hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Temu by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests).\n(2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch.\nand (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (\u201cBatch Arbitration\u201d).</p>All parties agree that Requests are of a \u201csubstantially similar nature\u201d if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief.\nTo the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise AAA, and AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (\u201cAdministrative Arbitrator\u201d).\nIn an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly.\nThe Administrative Arbitrator\u2019s fees shall be paid by Temu.You and Temu agree to cooperate in good faith with AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes.\nand (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.\nThis Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.<p>20.10.\n30-Day Right to Opt Out.\nYou have the right to opt out of the

out of this Arbitration Agreement.\nIf you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply to you.\nOpting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.</p>\n<p>20.11.\nInvalidity, Expiration.\nExcept as provided in Section 20.9, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.\nYou further agree that any Dispute that you have with Temu as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred.\nLikewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>20.12.\nModification.\nNotwithstanding any provision in the Terms to the contrary, we agree that if Temu makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will notify you.\nUnless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing to Temu at the applicable address set forth in Section 19.7, your continued use of the Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on or through the Services, following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes.\nChanges to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of the Terms and did not validly opt out of arbitration.\nIf you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Services, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Services or the Terms, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted the Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to the
