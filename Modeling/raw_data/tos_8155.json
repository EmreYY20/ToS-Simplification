(\u201c<strong>Claim</strong>\u201d or collectively, \u201c<strong>Claims</strong>\u201d).\nThe Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your agreement to these Terms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you are a new Webshare User, you can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days of accepting these Terms by emailing Webshare at [legal@webshare.io] with your first and last name and stating your intent to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement.\nNote that opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect any other part of these Terms, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought.</p>\n<p>For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at [legal@webshare.io] and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.\nIn the unlikely event that Webshare has not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any Claim exclusively through binding arbitration by AAA before a single arbitrator (the \u201c<strong>Arbitrator</strong>\u201d), under the Expedited Procedures then in effect for AAA (the \u201c<strong>Rules</strong>\u201d), except as provided herein.\nIn the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall control.\nAAA may be contacted at www.adr.org, where the Rules are also available.\nThe arbitration will be conducted in the U.S.\ncounty where you live or San Francisco, California unless you and Webshare agree otherwise.\nIf you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and Arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, and the award rendered by the Arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.\nIf you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (A) AAA may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from AAA.\n(B) the award rendered by the Arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.\nand (C) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process.\nAny judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nYou and Webshare agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.\nThe Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms, any provision of these Terms, is unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.</p>\n<p>Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as: preventing Webshare from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.\nor preventing you from asserting claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances on only an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall be severed.\nSeverance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall have no impact on the remaining provisions of the Arbitration Agreement, which shall remain in force, or the parties\u2019 ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver in Section 13.3 is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction.\nAll other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement shall be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.3 Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.\n</strong>WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES\u2019 INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nTHIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON\u2019S CLAIMS.\nYOU AND WEBSHARE AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).\nANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER WEBSHARE USERS.\nYOU AND WEBSHARE FURTHER AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND WEBSHARE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.\nGeneral</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.1 Assignment.\n</strong>These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Webshare without restriction.\nAny attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.2 Notification Procedures and Changes to these Terms.\n</strong>Webshare may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Webshare in our sole discretion.\nWebshare reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in these Terms.\nWebshare is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us.\nWebshare may, in its sole discretion, modify or update these Terms from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically.\nWhen we change these Terms in a material manner, we will update the \u2018last modified\u2019 date at the top of this page and notify you that material changes have been made to these Terms.\nYour continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service.\nIf you do not agree to any of these terms or any future terms of service, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.3 Entire Agreement/Severability.\n</strong>These Terms, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Webshare in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Webshare concerning the Service.\nExcept as otherwise stated in Section 13.2, if any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.4 No Waiver.\n</strong>No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Webshare\u2019s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.5 Contact.\n</strong>Please contact us at legal@webshare.io with any questions regarding these Terms.<br>\n</p>", "created_at":
