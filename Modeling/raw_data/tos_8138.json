on a participating A single-use or multi-ride ticket may be route specific.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>ORCA Cards are not, and do not represent, \u201cfinancial deposits\u201d.\nThey simply represent the

policies and restrictions of the Agency providing that trip.\nFor example:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Some products (i.e., passes) are specified for use at one</li>\n<li>A pass product valued at less than the required fare may be used in combination with E-purse value tocover the full cost of a trip, if loaded on a single ORCA Card (except on Washington State Ferries).</li>\n<li>Use of a single ORCA Card to pay for multiple riders is only accepted at Sound Transit vending machines and Washington State Ferries points of sale, where the Customer may use E-purse value to purchase rides for companion(s).</li>\n<li>A negative balance may occur if an ORCA Card is used at an offline validator, and the cost of the trip exceeds current funds.\nTo continue using the ORCA Card, funds must be added to bring the balance on the ORCA Card to a positive balance.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If an ORCA Product or combination of Products is not usable or is not sufficient to cover the applicable fare, the Customer is required to make full fare payment by a means other than an ORCA Card.\nAn insufficient ORCA fare cannot be combined with cash.</p>\n<p>The Agencies reserve the right to change fares at any time.\nPublic notice will be provided prior to a fare change.</p>\n<p>The Agencies reserve the right to establish the terms for the use of the ORCA Card on their transit systems.\nSome Agency

value on an ORCA Card is deducted to cover the applicable fare of a trip less any transfer value (except&nbsp.\non Washington State Ferries where no transfer value is recognized).\nThe amount of E-purse value remaining on your ORCA Card after a transaction will be displayed on the card reader while equipment is online.</p>\n<p>A customer with full access to the linked ORCA Card (that is not owned by a business account) who opts to withdraw from the ORCA Program may obtain a refund of the E-purse value that remains unused on the ORCA Card (as specified in Section 7).</p>\n<p>The ORCA

escheated value $75 or more per card, will be provided by the ORCA Agencies to the ORCA Customer annually beginning May 1 and the Customer may request the amount be refunded.\nThe ORCA Agencies reserve the right to validate the E-purse value to be refunded.\nIf no action is taken by the ORCA Customer, the value eligible for escheatment will be reported as unclaimed property to the Washington

Customer.</p>\n<p>\n</p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nCard Registration<p>You may participate in the ORCA Program without providing any personal information by using an anonymous adult ORCA Card.\nIf you choose to register your ORCA Card or an ORCA Card provided to you by your employer or other organization, the card number will be linked to your Customer Account (see ORCA Privacy Statement for more details).</p>\n<p>Some card types are automatically registered with the Customer\u2019s personal information when issued and cannot be unregistered because they offer a reduced fare to the

Records&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Washington Public Records Act (Chapter 42.56 RCW) (\u201cAct\u201d) applies to all records related to the ORCA Program including but not limited to:&nbsp.\nany data and reports related to the issuance, loading and use of ORCA Cards and Business Cards.\nPII that you provide.\nand the emails, comments and other communications between you and any of the ORCA Agencies.\nGenerally, public records are available for inspection and copying by the public but the Act exempts some records from mandatory disclosure.\nFor example, the Act contains the following exemptions from mandatory disclosure:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>RCW 42.56.330(4) The personally identifying information of current or former participants or applicants in a paratransit or other transit service operated for the benefit of persons with disabilities or elderly persons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>RCW 42.56.330(5) The personally identifying information of persons who acquire and use transit passes or other fare payment media including, but not limited to, stored value smart cards and magnetic strip cards, except that an agency may disclose personally identifying information to a person, employer, educational institution, or other entity that is responsible, in whole or in part, for payment of the cost of acquiring or using a transit pass or other fare payment media, and for the purpose of preventing fraud.\nAs used in this subsection, \u201cpersonally identifying information\u201d includes acquisition or use information pertaining to a specific, individual transit pass or fare payment media.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;(a) Information regarding the acquisition or use of transit passes or fare payment media may be disclosed in aggregate form if the data does not contain any personally identifying information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;(b) Personally identifying information may be released to a parent or guardian who provided PII for a youth cardholder under age 13, or to law enforcement agencies if the request is accompanied by a court order.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Agencies reserve their discretion, if any, to release or withhold records in accordance with the Act.\nThe Agencies reserve the right to impose fees in accordance with the Act for responding to requests for inspection and copying of records.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Statement and the Public Records Act or other law governing the disclosure of records, the Public Records Act or other applicable law will control.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>10.\nInformation Security&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Agencies\u2019 security measures are intended to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information collected or generated under the ORCA Program.\nFor example, steps have been taken to safeguard the integrity of their telecommunications and computing infrastructure, including but not limited to authentication, monitoring, auditing and encryption.\nIn addition, customer orders are processed through a secure server using advanced forms of encryption software.\nThis means that all your PII entered online will be encrypted during transmission to maximize security protection.\nHowever, because the ORCA Website does not encrypt email, you should not send emails containing information that you consider sensitive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the above, this Privacy Statement should not be construed in any way as providing business, legal or other advice, or warranting as fail-proof, the security of information provided by or submitted to the ORCA Website or otherwise

disclaim, assurance that the information you provide to them will remain free from loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties, who, despite the Agencies\u2019 efforts, may obtain unauthorized access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If, despite the ORCA Program\u2019s information security measures, unencrypted \u201cpersonal information\u201d held by the Agencies was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person, the Agencies shall notify the subject of that personal information in accordance with RWC 42.56.590.\nFor purposes of this Section, \u201cpersonal information\u201d has the same definition as it does in RCW 42.56.590(5) and (6).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>11.\nChanges to Personally Identifiable Information&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Agencies depend on the users of ORCA Cards and ORCA Products to update their own PII whenever necessary.\nYou may use the ORCA App,

LIMITED TO PII) COLLECTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ORCA PROGRAM WILL REMAIN FREE FROM UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR DISCLOSURE, LOSS, MISUSE, ALTERATION OR THEFT AND THE AGENCIES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY SUCH
