to process your personal information?\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>In Short:</em>\n</strong>\n<em>We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information.\nAs such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose.\nYou can withdraw your consent at any time.\nClick here to learn more.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong> We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms.\nFor example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent).\nYou can withdraw your consent at any time.\nClick here to learn more.</p>\n<p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>\n<li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>\n<li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>\n<li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>\n<li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>\n<li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>\n<li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>\n<li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>\n<li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>\n<li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>\n<li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>\n</ul>\n4.\nWhen and with whom do we share your personal information?\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>In Short:</em>\n</strong>\n<em>We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.</em>\n</p>\n<p>We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during

media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins).\nWhere you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider.\nThe profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.</p>\n<p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services.\nPlease note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider.\nWe recommend that

or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).\nNo purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>\n<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>\n8.\nHow do we keep your information safe?\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>In Short:</em>\n</strong>\n<em>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</em>\n</p>\n<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.\nHowever, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.\nAlthough we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk.\nYou should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>\n9.\nDo we collect information from minors?\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>In Short:</em>\n</strong>\n<em>We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children

automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.\nIf a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>\n12.\nDo California residents have specific privacy rights?\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>In Short:</em>\n</strong>\n<em>Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are

recognize you when you visit our website at https://waldo.vision (\u201cWebsite\u201d).\nIt explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>\n<p>In some cases we may use cookies to collect personal information, or that becomes personal information if we combine it with other information.</p>\nWhat are cookies?\n<p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.\nCookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>\n<p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Waldo Intelligence LLC) are called \u201cfirst-party cookies.\u201d Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called \u201cthird-party cookies.\u201d Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics).\nThe parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>\nWhy do we use cookies?\n<p>We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons.\nSome cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Website to operate, and we refer to these as \u201cessential\u201d or \u201cstrictly necessary\u201d cookies.\nOther cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties.\nThird parties serve cookies through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.\nThis is described in more detail below.</p>\nHow can I control cookies?\n<p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\nYou can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager.\nThe Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which categories of cookies you accept or reject.\nEssential cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.</p>\n<p>The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and on our website.\nIf you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted.\nYou may also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies.</p>\n<p>The specific types of first- and third-party cookies served through our Website and the purposes they perform are described in the table below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific Online Properties you visit):</p>\n<br>\nName:_gaPurpose:It records a particular ID used to come up with data about website usage by the user.\nIt is a HTTP cookie that expires after 2 years.Provider:.waldo.visionService:Google Analytics View Service Privacy Policy

client identifier, which allows calculation of visits and sessions.Provider:.waldo.visionService:Google Analytics View Service Privacy Policy Country:United StatesType:http_cookieExpires in:1 year 11 months 29 days\n<br>\nHow can I control cookies on my browser?\n<p>As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser to browser, you should visit your browser\u2019s help menu for more information.\nThe following is information about how to manage cookies on the most popular browsers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chrome</li>\n<li>Internet Explorer</li>\n<li>Firefox</li>\n<li>Safari</li>\n<li>Edge</li>\n<li>Opera</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising.\nIf you would like to find out more information, please visit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Digital Advertising Alliance</li>\n<li>Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada</li>\n<li>European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance</li>\n</ul>\nWhat about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?\n<p>Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website.\nWe may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called \u201ctracking pixels\u201d or \u201cclear gifs\u201d).\nThese are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our Website or opened an email including them.\nThis allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns.\nIn many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.</p>\nDo you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?\n<p>Websites may also use so-called \u201cFlash Cookies\u201d (also known as Local Shared Objects or \u201cLSOs\u201d) to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention, and for other site operations.</p>\n<p>If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel.\nYou can also control Flash Cookies by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to \u201cinformation\u201d on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).</p>\n<p>Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our services or online content.</p>\nDo you serve targeted advertising?\n<p>Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our Website.\nThese companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in.\nThey may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements.\nThey can accomplish this by using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you.\nThe information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details, or other details that directly identify you unless you choose to provide these.</p>\nHow often will you update this Cookie Policy?\n<p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.\nPlease therefore revisit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.</p>\n<p>The date at the top of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.</p>\nWhere can I get further information?\n<p>If you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at contact@waldo.vision or by post to:</p>\n<code>Waldo Intelligence LLC\nPO BOX
