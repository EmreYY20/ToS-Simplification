Choices</li>\n<li>Procedure When We Update This Statement</li>\n</ul> American Civil Liberties Union Privacy Statement <p>Effective as of January 17, 2023.</p>\n<p>The American Civil Liberties Union, Inc.\n(\u201cUnion\u201d) and the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, Inc.\n(\u201cFoundation\u201d) (collectively, \u201cACLU,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cus\u201d) are committed to protecting the personal information that you provide and entrust to us when using our websites.</p>\n<p>This Online Privacy Statement describes how we treat data collected during your visit to ACLU \u201cSites.\u201d The ACLU Sites include the Union\u2019s website at aclu.org, which may host Foundation content, including all web pages whose domain name contains aclu.org, www.aclu.org, or action.aclu.org, peoplepower.org, and any other websites which are operated by the ACLU and link to this privacy statement.</p>\n<p>To be clear, this is not the online privacy statement for websites operated by the ACLU that do not contain these domain names and do not link to this online privacy statement \u2013 for example, www.standwithsnowden.com and www.aclufoundation.org.\nThose websites have site-specific privacy terms, which are posted on those sites.</p>\n<p>This privacy statement also does not apply to websites that the ACLU does not operate where an ACLU entity has a presence, such as ACLU pages on Facebook.</p>\n<p>Finally, this is not the online privacy statement for the websites of any ACLU local/state affiliate organizations (\u201cAffiliates\u201d).\nIn all of those cases, site-specific privacy terms apply, and are posted accordingly.\nPlease note, however, that this Privacy Statement provides for ACLU to share data collected on the ACLU Sites with Affiliates for use consistent with this Privacy Statement, which is described in more detail below, and that you may be redirected to one of our Sites when interacting with the website of our state Affiliates or other partners.\nACLU and its Affiliates may be collectively referred to as \u201cACLU Organizations\u201d in this Online Privacy Statement and elsewhere on our Sites.</p> Privacy and the Internet <p>The Internet, generally speaking, is not currently a private place.\nAs you visit websites, use search engines, and conduct business on the Internet, many different companies and organizations are gathering information about your online behavior by tracking your searches, visits, and transactions, and then matching that data with other information about you or leveraging algorithms to predict your behavior.\nThere are some things you can do to prevent your information from being collected.\nWe encourage you to read our Easy Steps Everyone Can Take to Protect Their Digital Privacy to help protect your privacy online.</p>\n<p>Like most websites, our Sites collect and process a range of data about their visitors to enable full functionality of the website and to deliver requested services.\nWe take many steps to protect your privacy when you visit our Sites.\nHow and when we do so is explained below.</p> Data We Collect <p>In order to advance our advocacy and outreach programs, and to provide you with a better experience when interacting with the ACLU, we rely on data collected from our supporters.\nData collected includes information that you provide directly and web data that may be automatically received and recorded by us from your browser.\nThis section outlines what data is collected, as well as information on how we use collected data.</p> Information you provide directly <p>Certain pages on the Site may invite you to share personal information, such as your name, address, email address, telephone number, payment information (e.g., credit card information to complete a transaction), or other information you provide when submitting an application.\nSharing this information will allow you to make a donation, make a purchase in our online store, join our email list, sign a petition, register for an event or volunteer shift, send us a message or feedback, or to participate in other similar online activities.</p> Web data <p>The ACLU uses cookies and similar technologies to operate our Sites.</p> Required Web Data Collection <p>We may automatically receive and record information from your browser when you visit our Sites.\nThe information that we collect with these automated methods may include your IP address, cookie information, browser type, system type, and the referring URL.</p>\n<p>In addition, if you sign up for our email list(s), we may send you emails that include technologies to track open and click rates.</p>\n<p>These web data collection technologies support our operations and the security of our Sites.</p> Optional Cookies <p>We may also use cookies to improve website performance, to remember user preferences and settings, and to collect analytic data.\nBy \u201ccookies\u201d we mean small files placed on to your device by websites you visit.\n\u201cCookies\u201d may also refer to local storage, which is a mechanism similar to cookies where the information is stored within your web browser.\nIn some instances, we place these cookies ourselves.\nIn other instances, we allow outside service providers to place these cookies, but only if those providers abide by our requirements described below under \u201cHow We Work with Service Providers.\u201d</p>\n<p>For more information on how we use cookies and similar technologies, please see Web Data We Collect.\nYou can learn How to Disable Cookies in the section on Your Choices below.</p> Third Party Links and Hosted Content <p>Our Sites are connected in a variety of ways to content hosted by third parties, including links to social media sites, links to other sites, and embedded media.\nWhen you access this content, including content that loads when you browse on the aclu.org domain, third party content hosts may place tracking devices (e.g.\ncookies or pixels) on your computer, access existing tracking devices that were set when you previously visited other websites, or otherwise gather information about you as you access their content.</p>\n<p>When you click on links to third party websites, including social media sites, you will leave our Site.\nTo learn about how those third parties treat the data they collect through tracking devices and otherwise, see their respective online privacy policies and other posted guidance.</p>\n<p>When you view embedded media, such as videos, that are hosted on other platforms, such as YouTube, but viewable directly through the buttons we provide, you will remain on our Site but you will be visiting these third party\u2019s web environments.\nIn these instances, we make clear that you are viewing external content when you click on links or buttons.</p> Our Data Practices <p>We may use your data to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fulfill your orders or complete transactions.</li>\n<li>Contact you about other ACLU activities or news, or about opportunities to support the ACLU.</li>\n<li>Conduct research in order to learn about our constituents as a whole and about ways we might engage you individually.</li>\n<li>In the case of petitions, we may display your first name, last initial, and city and state on our website.</li>\n<li>In the case of petitions or other direct messages to advocacy targets (such as your member of congress), all required information fields (e.g.\nname, email address, etc.) will be, and some optional information fields may be, passed on to the advocacy target with your message.</li>\n<li>If you have joined People Power, share your name and contact information with other volunteers, and acknowledge your participation in specific volunteer activities.</li>\n<li>Use or share your information as otherwise disclosed at the point of collection.\nFor example, when you elect to take an action on our website\u2014such as sign a petition or pledge\u2014we may request information about you and provide a notice that completing and submitting the form will mean that you permit us to share the data you have entered with other parties, such as coalition partners for that campaign.</li>\n<li>Deliver targeted content\u2014including advertisements\u2014to you over the phone, through the mail, and using digital platforms such as social media, other websites, search results pages, and mobile applications.</li>\n<li>Measure and improve the performance of our Site.</li>\n<li>Investigate or maintain the stability and security of our Site.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To perform each of these functions, we may share your information with service providers that support our operations.\nFor an understanding of how your data is shared with those vendors, please see \u201cHow We Work with Service Providers\u201d below.</p> Additional Uses <p>This section provides additional information on some special circumstances where we may use or share your data with other organizations.\nWe believe you should have choice regarding these activities and have included information on how you can choose whether your data is used for these practices in the section Communication Preferences below.\nFor an understanding of how your data is shared with those vendors, please see \u201cHow We Work with Service Providers\u201d below.\nThese additional uses are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delivering targeted content, including advertisements, to you on non-ACLU digital platforms such as social media, other websites, search results pages and mobile apps.</li>\n<li>Engaging in list sharing agreements with non-partisan organizations that may be of interest to you.</li>\n</ul> Deliver targeted content on non-ACLU platforms <p>To enable us to provide the most relevant information on our activities, we may share your personal information with communications platforms, such as Facebook and Mother Jones, to deliver our content to you or to identify other people who may enjoy our content.</p>\n<p>We may also share ACLU supporter information with organizations that display our advertisements or petitions to their subscribers in order to reduce the volume of communications you may receive.\nThis practice helps us engage in effective fundraising and advocacy operations and enables our teams to communicate more effectively with known supporters.</p>\n<p>Importantly, we want you to have the opportunity to learn about these practices and give you the opportunity to opt out of them.\nFor additional information on with whom we share your data\u2014which may include name, zip code, email address, and other information\u2014for delivering targeted content on non-ACLU platforms, please see this <b>list of service providers</b> delivering targeted content on non-ACLU platforms.\nIf you do not wish to have your data shared with these service providers, please let us know by completing our <b>Communication Preferences form</b>.\nAdditional information on how to change your communication preferences is outlined in the section on Communication Preferences below.</p> Engage in list sharing agreements with non-partisan organizations <p>We sometimes allow other non-partisan organizations to contact our supporters who have chosen to share their information with us.\nWorking with other organizations in this way, either on a rental basis, in an exchange, or through a data sharing co-op, is critical to maintaining a strong membership base by allowing us to lower costs while reaching the widest possible audience.\nData shared on a rental basis or in an exchange is done on a one-time use basis.\nA data sharing co-op aggregates and models data from multiple organizations to identify individuals that might be interested in hearing from co-op members.\nWhen we leave a data sharing co-op, our data is removed from that co-op\u2019s data model.</p>\n<p>In order to protect your privacy, list sharing agreements are conducted through secure and confidential arrangements in which the external organization does not directly receive information about you unless you choose to engage.\nCommunications generated from list sharing agreements are carried out by a third-party service provider, who keeps your information confidential.\nThe other organization learns information about you only if you choose to respond to the third-party communication.\nIf you do not wish us to make information about you available for this type of communication, please let us know by completing our <b>Communication Preferences form</b>.\nAdditional information on how to change your communication preferences is outlined in the section on Your Choices below.</p> Data Sharing How We Work with Our Affiliates <p>We work and share your data with our ACLU affiliates around the United States to create a coherent experience for our supporters and members.\nOur Affiliates are bound to use the data that we provide them no more broadly than as would be allowed under this Online Privacy Statement, and with regard to their own operations.</p> How We Work with Service Providers <p>We work with a variety of service providers who help us undertake the activities outlined in \u201cOur Data Collection Methods,\u201d including processing data.\nfacilitating the operation of our site.\nsupporting our fundraising, marketing, communications, and advocacy programs.\nand delivering messages to you on other platforms.\nFor example, service providers may help us analyze traffic on our site, process credit card transactions, or facilitate activities such as the collection and delivery of petition signatures or surveys.</p>\n<p>When we share personal information about you with a service provider, (1) we transmit it in a secure manner (please see Security Measures and Data Transmission below for more information on our security practices) and (2) we require that service provider to promise to keep that data confidential and use it only for the purpose of carrying out the functions we have engaged it to perform.</p>\n<p>We allow some service providers to compile and use certain aggregated data for other purposes once it has been de-identified.\nThis may include, for example, analyzing de-identified data in order to assess donor trends across organizations over time, or allowing a service provider to take de-identified and aggregated data about activity on our Sites, and using that data for other purposes such as improvement of their products or benchmarking for their other clients.\nBut we won\u2019t agree to that unless we are confident, in each instance, that the data won\u2019t be recombined with other information to create any record about you as an identifiable individual.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Additionally, we may share your data with service providers to deliver targeted content to you on non-ACLU platforms, as described in the above section \u201cAdditional Uses.\u201d Data shared with these service providers are hashed to improve privacy (hashing data refers to the practice of scrambling data in a pre-defined manner to make it more difficult to recognize).\nAs we have limited ability to perform detailed reviews of these service providers\u2019 security practices, and the service providers\u2019 terms are subject to change without notice, we rely on publicly posted information to determine whether their data practices meet our standards.\nWe review these terms on a quarterly basis to confirm that they have not materially changed their assurances.\n</em>\n</p> Mandatory Disclosures <p>We may also disclose your data to third parties if we are required to do so by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, a court order, or government reporting obligations, or if we determine that sharing data about you is necessary to detect, prevent, and respond to misuse of the Sites or privacy and security threats to the Sites.</p>\n<p>We will object to legal demands for access to your information that we believe to be improper.\nHowever, if we determine we are required by law to disclose your data and if we are legally permitted to do so, we will attempt to provide you with notice of the request by whatever method is reasonably practical prior to making the disclosure to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure.\nWe will not provide such notice, however, if the disclosure is pursuant to our regular government reporting obligations, such as financial disclosures required for tax law compliance.</p> Security Measures and Data Transmission <p>We have taken physical, electronic, and administrative measures to safeguard the information we collect.\nWe work to ensure data accuracy and protect against unauthorized access to, and improper use of, information we collect online.</p>\n<p>Information that can be readily linked to you personally, such as your name and address, is stored by us on servers subject to security safeguards.\nAdditionally, all data transmitted to and from our Sites, including credit card numbers, are encrypted in transit.</p>\n<p>We require our service providers to whom we transfer your personal information to agree to take reasonable security measures in the handling and storage of that information.\nFor service providers to whom we transfer particularly sensitive personal information, we may also undergo a more intensive assessment of their platforms and security practices to verify their commitments to maintain the confidentiality and privacy of that information in their possession.\nWe may also hash that information in order to improve privacy.\nThis is true when sharing data to deliver targeted content on non-ACLU platforms.</p>\n<p>Consistent with these practices, we attempt to transmit emails to you using opportunistic Transport Layer Security (TLS).\nIf your email provider does not accept our initial attempt to transmit using TLS, your message will be sent in plain text, which is not secure.</p> Your Choices Communication Preferences <p>If you wish to update personal information or change your communication preferences, you may contact us to update our records.\nYou have the following options to do this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are enrolled to receive non-People Power\u202f<b>ACLU and
