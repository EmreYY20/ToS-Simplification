and not all of the details have been included herein.\nIn light of this, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights.</p>\n<p>Your principal rights under data protection law are:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the right to access;</li>\n<li>the right to rectification;</li>\n<li>the right to

to the personal data, together with certain additional information.\nThat additional information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of the personal data.\nProviding the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data.\nThe first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee.\nYou can access your personal data by visiting the UoPeople Self\u2013Service Portal when logged into the website.</p>\n<p>You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed.\nUoPeople will also correct, amend or delete any personal information that is inaccurate and notify any third-party recipients of the necessary changes.\nUoPeople may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law or GDPR.</p>\n<p>In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data [by providing adequate evidence attesting to your identity] without undue delay.\nThose circumstances include: the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.\nyou withdraw consent to consent-based processing.\nthe processing is for direct marketing purposes.\nand the personal data have been unlawfully processed.\nThere are certain general exclusions of the right to erasure.\nThose general exclusions include where processing is necessary: [for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information.\nfor compliance with a legal obligation.\nor for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims].</p>\n<p>In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data.\nThose circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data.\nprocessing is unlawful but you oppose erasure.\nwe no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.\nand you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection.\nWhere processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data.\nHowever, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent.\nfor the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.\nfor the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person.\nor for reasons of important public interest.</p>\n<p>You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us.\nor the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.\nIf you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>\n<p>To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is consent, and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.\nHowever, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>\n<p>If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to file complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection.\nYou may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.</p>\n<p>To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.\nWithdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.</p>\n<p>You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by written notice to us in addition to the other methods specified in this Section 5.</p> Opt-in <p>When you provide us with PII for a secondary reason, like marketing or other secondary reasons which we will convey to you from time to time if applicable, we will ask for your consent.\nAfter you opt-in, you may withdraw your consent anytime, by contacting us at support@UoPeople.edu or admissions@UoPeople.edu.\nOr, please go to this site to withdraw your consent to processing.</p> Security of your Personal Information <p>The University maintains reasonable measures to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.\nThe University stores the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled environment that has implemented protections against unauthorized access, use or disclosure.\nUoPeople has implemented procedures to safeguard the integrity of its information technology assets, including, but not limited to, authentication, monitoring, auditing, and encryption.\nThese security procedures have been integrated into the design, implementation, and day-to-day operations of the Website as part of University\u2019s continuing commitment to the security of electronic content as well as the electronic transmission of information.</p>\n<p>For website security purposes and to maintain the availability of the Website for all users, the University employs software to monitor traffic and identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information or otherwise damage the Website.\nWhen personally identifiable information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>\n<p>The University, however, cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat the measures described in this section or use your personally identifiable information for improper purposes.\nNothing in this Privacy Policy or in the University\u2019s Terms of Use shall be deemed a guarantee, contract, or warranty of any kind, whether express or implied, regarding the security of your personally identifiable information.</p> Educational Records <p>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974 was designed to protect the privacy of educational records, establish the rights of students to inspect and review their educational records, and provide guidelines for the correction of inaccurate or misleading information through informal and formal hearings.\nWhile FERPA does not apply to the University, since it is not a federally-funded institution, the University nonetheless strives to meet FERPA\u2019s provisions to the extent reasonably feasible.</p>\n<p>The University will not disclose a student\u2019s educational record without obtaining the student\u2019s prior written consent, except that a student\u2019s educational record may be disclosed (i) to other school officials,

functions.\n(ii) to parents of a dependent student, as defined in section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n(iii) to accrediting organizations.\n(iv) in compliance with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena.\nor (v) for any other reason permitted under 34 CFR \u00a7 99.31.</p>\n<p>The University depends on the accuracy of the records submitted by its students.\nFalse information on an application, or any other act to intentionally mislead or misinform instructional personnel or administrators, is grounds for disciplinary action, including dismissal from the University.\nStudents seeking access or amendment of their educational records should contact the Office of Student Services at Student.Services@uopeople.edu.</p> Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act <p>Although neither this website nor any of the University\u2019s services are intended for children under 13 years of age, the University complies with the Children\u2019s Online

platform.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is a seamless transition from UoPeople\u2019s main website to the University\u2019s Moodle platform.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>No one outside the UoPeople community is permitted to access the UoPeople Moodle platform.\nHowever, the UoPeople Moodle site administrators have access to nearly everything in the system and certain private information is also accessible by other UoPeople students, faculty and staff:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>UoPeople profile page.\nEvery UoPeople student has a profile page in Moodle, which contains their first and last name, email address (optional), profile picture (optional) and description (optional).\nThis information is visible to classmates for each course in which a student is enrolled, and to all students, faculty and staff through the Academic Advising Virtual Office.\nUoPeople profile pages are NOT available to the general public.</li>\n<li>UoPeople discussion forums.\nSince UoPeople is based on the peer-learning model, the University makes great use of discussion forums in its courses.\nAnything posted in a discussion forum is visible to the instructor and to all students enrolled in that course.\nFor large classes that are divided into groups, only members of your group can see your posts.\nYour posts will include your full name and profile picture if you have chosen to upload it to the system.</li>\n<li>UoPeople peer-assessed assignments.\nAll assignments assessed by other students in a particular course are submitted anonymously.\nUnless you put your name on your peer- assessed assignment, which is not a requirement, only instructors and administrators will be able to see who has evaluated your assignment.</li>\n<li>Private messaging system.\nOnly the sender and receiver can view the content of messages sent through the Moodle privacy messaging system.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you withdraw from the University, your account will be disabled and will no longer

<p>UoPeople's Yammer Enterprise Network provides a collaborative environment for UoPeople students, faculty, alumni, staff and volunteers from throughout the globe (\u201cUoPeople Community\u201d) to connect and share meaningful information.\nNote that there is a seamless transition from UoPeople\u2019s main website to the University\u2019s Yammer Network.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By enrolling in UoPeople\u2019s Yammer Network, you understand and agree that your personal profile and any content you post will be visible to other members of the UoPeople Community and to anyone outside the community who manages to log in to the UoPeople Yammer Network.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Confidential student information and other sensitive or private content should not be posted on the Yammer Network.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Although UoPeople administrators monitor all posts and comments to the UoPeople Yammer Network, you are ultimately responsible for the content you post and UoPeople has a right and obligation to report any user who posts illegal content and threats of violence to the authorities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Prior to enrollment in the UoPeople Yammer Enterprise Network, users should review Microsoft\u2019s Yammer Privacy Statement and UoPeople\u2019s Yammer Terms of Use.</p> Third Party Websites, Cookies and Privacy Policies <p>Certain pages of the Website may

websites for which UoPeople may implement plugins.\nUoPeople may permit other companies to place cookies and use cookies according to the university policies and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\n</p> Third-party Providers <p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.\nHowever, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.\nIn particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located a different jurisdiction than either you or us.\nSo, if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.\nFor example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your PII used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once you leave our Website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our Website\u2019s Terms of Service.</p> Third-party Links <p>Occasionally,
