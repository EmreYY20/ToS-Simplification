so the foregoing limitation may not apply to you.</p>\n17.\nArbitration Agreement.\nClass Waiver.\nWaiver of Trial by Jury.\n<p>\n<strong>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU AND ROOMMATES TO AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN US THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</strong> In this Section 17 (the \u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d), you and the Roommates Parties agree that all claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including all statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Services that cannot be resolved in small claims court will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and the Roommates Parties are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents.\nTo be clear: the phrase \u201call claims and disputes\u201d also includes claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of these Terms.\nIn addition, all disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim (including disputes about the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator, except as expressly provided below.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Arbitration Rules.</strong> The Federal Arbitration Act, including its procedural provisions, governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision, and not state law.\nArbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") (https://adr.org/).\nIf the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum, and if they cannot agree, will ask the court to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 5.\nThe AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator.\nAny judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Fees.</strong> The AAA sets forth fees for its services, which are available at https://adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Fee_Schedule_2.pdf.\nIf Roommates is the party initiating an arbitration against you, Roommates will pay all costs associated with the arbitration, including the entire filing fee.\nIf you are the party initiating an arbitration against the Roommates Parties, you will be responsible for the $200 nonrefundable Consumer Case Filing Fee, and Roommates will pay all other fees required by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules.\nEither party may make a request that the arbitrator award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs upon proving that the other party has asserted a claim, cross-claim, or defense that is groundless in fact or law, brought in bad faith, or for the purpose of harassment, or is otherwise frivolous, unless prohibited by applicable law and the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Authority of the Arbitrator.</strong> The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the Roommates Parties.\nThe dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.\nThe arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute.\nThe arbitrator may award any relief allowed by law or the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, but declaratory or injunctive relief may be awarded only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant\u2019s individual claim.\nThe arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.\nThe award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Roommates Parties.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong> YOU AND ROOMMATES WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.\nYou and Roommates are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration.\nArbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.\nIn any litigation between you and Roommates over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND ROOMMATES WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</strong> ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS.\nCLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.\nIf, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration.\ninstead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 18.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Confidentiality</strong>.\nExcept as may be required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, no party shall be prevented from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Arbitration Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Right to Waive.</strong> Any rights and limitations set forth in this arbitration agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted.\nSuch waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this arbitration agreement.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Small Claims Court.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Roommates may bring an individual action in small claims court.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Survival.</strong> This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with the Roommates Parties.</li>\n</ol>\n18.\nExclusive Venue\n<p>To the extent that these Terms allow you or Roommates to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Roommates agree that all claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Services will be litigated exclusively in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona.\nIf, however, that court would lack original jurisdiction over the litigation, then all such claims and disputes will be litigated exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction in Maricopa County, Arizona.\nYou and Roommates consent to the personal jurisdiction of both courts.</p>\n19.\nChoice of Law\n<p>Except to the extent they are preempted by U.S.\nfederal law, the laws of Arizona, other than its conflict-of-laws principles, govern these Terms and any claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise) arising out of or relating to these Terms or their subject matter.</p>\n20.\nSeverability\n<p>If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that provision will be severed from these Terms and not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>\n21.\nAdditional Terms\n<ul>\n<li>These Terms supersede all prior understandings regarding the same and represent the complete agreement between you and Roommates.</li>\n<li>These Terms do no create or confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</li>\n<li>We may change or modify these Terms at any time and in our sole discretion.\nIf we make changes to these Terms, we will provide notice of such changes, such as by sending a notification, posting a notice on the Services, or updating the \"Last Updated\" date above.</li>\n<li>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</li>\n<li>You may not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our consent.</li>\n<li>Your continued use of the Services will confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms.</li>\n<li>We encourage you to frequently review the Terms to ensure you understand the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Services.</li>\n<li>If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you must stop using the Services and delete your Roommates account.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Questions and
