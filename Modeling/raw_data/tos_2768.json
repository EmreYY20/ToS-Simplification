example, we might use a web beacon to learn whether an email message was opened or we might store preferences in a flash cookie.</p>What types of cookies and other technologies does Unity use?<p>As described below Unity employs a number of technologies to provide and improve the Service.\nDepending on your location, you will be offered a choice to accept or decline our use of these technologies, but you are welcome also to exercise the choices described below.&nbsp.\nPlease note declining cookies may cause our website not to function correctly.</p>\n<p>Generally, our cookies fall into the following categories listed below with some examples of the uses for each category:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strictly Necessary cookies:&nbsp;&nbsp;These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems.\nThey are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms.\nYou can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work.\nThese cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.</li>\n<li>Functionality cookies:&nbsp;&nbsp;These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation.\nThey may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages.\nIf you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly.</li>\n<li>Performance cookies:&nbsp;These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site.\nThey help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site.\nAll information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous.\nIf you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.\n&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Third party advertising cookies:&nbsp;&nbsp;These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners.\nThey may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites.\nThey do not store directly personal information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device.\nIf you do not allow these cookies, you will still see ads, but they will not be tailored to your interests.\nThese cookies are read by our advertising partners and allow us to re-target you with advertising as you browse the web.</li>\n<li>Social Media cookies: These cookies are set by a range of social media services that we have added to the site to enable you to share our content with your friends and networks.\nThey are capable of tracking your browser across other sites and building up a profile of your interests.\nThis may impact the content and messages you see on other websites you visit.\nIf you do not allow these cookies you may not be able to use or see these sharing tools.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below is more information about the specific technology employed for the above purposes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Browser cookies: Unity uses browser cookies.\nMost major browser companies offer tools or settings for Users that do not want cookies set or read on their devices.\nPlease visit your browser\u2019s settings or privacy settings pages.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Local Shared Objects: Unity may use local shared objects (also known as Flash cookies) on its sites.\nFlash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser will not remove flash cookies.\nTo learn more about how to manage flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe website and make changes at the Global Privacy Settings Panel.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Beacons, pixel tags, clear gifs: Unity or its service providers or third parties advertising within the Service may use these technologies to learn the online behavior and interests of Users and to personalize ads that Users see.\nTo learn more about behavioral advertising, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative\u2019s website..</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Device IDs and digital fingerprinting: The Service may use one or more of a variety of unique identifiers to recognize users and their devices, including MAC address, IDFA, Android Ad ID, and digital fingerprint, which may be comprised of several types of data, including device name, the app list or applications installed on the device, and browser characteristics.\nNOTE: Unity may also generate and assign a user ID when you access or use one of its Services.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>What are my privacy choices for advertising?<p>Advertising helps to defray certain costs of providing Services, especially costs that are incurred by Unity but not recovered from Users.\nThus, you may not have a choice to prevent advertisements from being presented when using the Services.\nhowever, you do have choices to limit personalized advertisements that are tailored to your interests.</p>\n<p>Unity has implemented a cookie management tool for its website.&nbsp.\nIn addition, you may also be able to control targeting as you browse the web through browser settings and other mechanisms.\nIf you do not wish to receive personalized advertising that is delivered by third parties, you may be able to exercise that choice through opt-out programs that are administered by third parties, including the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), and/or the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EIDAA).\nWhere applicable, you may exercise your opt-out choices at the&nbsp;NAI website, the&nbsp;DAA website, or the&nbsp;EIDAA website.\nUnity does not control these third-party-provided opt-out processes and is not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>\n<p>If Unity delivers personalized advertising, Unity will provide notice and information about how you may be able to opt-out of such personalized advertisements.\n&nbsp;Such opportunity to opt out may occur through your device settings (See \u201cInformation and choices regarding tracking and targeting on mobile devices\u201d below).</p>\n<p>Developers may use other third party advertising networks.\nIf you do not wish to receive personalized advertising that is delivered by third parties, you may be able to exercise that choice through opt-out programs that are administered by third parties, including the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), and/or the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EIDAA).\nWhere applicable, you may exercise your opt-out choices at the NAI website, the DAA website, or the EIAA website.\nUnity does not control these third-party provided opt-out processes and is not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>\n<p>Unity uses Google, among others, to provide advertising through the Services and on third party websites.\nWe may use the following features based on Google Analytics for Display Advertising: Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.\nTo opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads, you can visit the Google Ads Settings page.</p>More choices regarding browser cookies and beacons and other tracking technologies<p>There are several browser plugins available to Users that want to be better informed about and have more control over the use of cookies and related technologies on their devices.\nSome popular ones are Ghostery and Abine.</p>Information and choices regarding tracking and targeting on mobile devices<ul>\n<li>\n<p>As of the effective date of this policy, Apple and Google offered the owners of devices that use their operating systems, iOS and Android, options for limiting tracking and targeting in relation to ads.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;Unity does not control your device level opt out processes and is not responsible for any choices you make through such mechanism or for the continued availability, accuracy, effectiveness, or location of that mechanism.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;Using a device level opt-out mechanism may opt you out of all third party personalized advertisements, not just those delivered by Unity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you use an Apple device go here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you use an Android device, navigate to the google settings page, select ads and then choose to reset your Android Ad ID or opt-out of personalized ads.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To learn about options for many mobile ad networks, go

Edit/Review:&nbsp.\nApril 27, 2021</p>1.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)<p>These FAQs provide a handy entry point to our longer and more comprehensive Privacy Policy (see Section 2 below).\nThey are intended to enhance rather than replace the important notices in the Privacy Policy, which governs our collection, use, storage, and sharing of the information that we collect or receive from you.</p>What's new as of April, 2021?<p>On April 27, 2021, we added information to add our VisualLive product to our privacy policy.\nPlease note instructions on how to order your data reports for this product.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On April 8, 2021, we made edits to the Privacy Policy to incorporate our privacy practices regarding ChilliConnect, Furioos, and Rest AR.\nWe also made updates to Section 13, to incorporate data subject rights provided for by LGPD and the Israel Protection of Privacy Law.\nFinally, we made some formatting and clarifying changes to other sections.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On October 18, 2020, we made edits to the Privacy Policy to incorporate our privacy practices regarding Artomatix, C\u00f3dice Software (Plastic SCM), deltaDNA, and Finger Food ATG.\nWe made some edits about the information we may collect as well as our use and sharing of it.\nWe expanded on how we determine our retention periods.\nWe added information relating to Canadian Privacy Rights.\nWe updated our EU address.\nWe updated our Third Party Ad Network Partners.\nFinally, we added a provision on biometric information related to forthcoming products and services.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On August 17, 2020, we made an edit to Section 12 to provide an additional summary of rights for data collected in Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On May 27, 2020, we made the following updates: We are updating our policy to include a reference to our service provider\u2019s privacy statement in Section 5.&nbsp.\nWe are notifying you by asking you to accept this new policy to be sure you see this update.&nbsp.\nPlease note if you do not pay your Unity fees by credit card, this change has no effect on you.&nbsp.\nOther changes on May 27, 2020 include an addition of three partners in Section 16 for ads network partners.&nbsp.\nNote players in the European Union have had this information available to consider prior to today.\nhowever, we will only now begin sharing ads data with those partners for EU players.&nbsp.\nFinally, we have added a section about features involving Unity\u2019s access to cameras on devices.&nbsp.\nYou will note there is similar language in the consent we request for access to the camera, and we do not collect images from your device at this time.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as of March 10, 2020, we are adding a last edit/review date.&nbsp.\nThe difference between an edit/review and an update is that \"updates\" involve material changes to our policy whereas edits are not material or simply indicate a review has occurred.&nbsp.\nFor example, we may make clarifying edits by giving additional examples.&nbsp.\nWhen we provide an update, you receive a notice to accept and read the changes, which are summarized in this first FAQ.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, we enhanced our FAQs in May 2018 to provide more examples of how we may use some of the data we collect.\nThese answers enhanced our prior explanations but are not intended to imply that these are new uses of collected data.\nAdditionally, if your data indicates you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), we have added information regarding new choices enabled for in-game advertising, and information on how you can exercise your data access and deletion (erasure) rights.\nWe have added the l\u201cData Privacy\u201d icon to our ads, dashboards, and other points of interaction:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This icon will show you where you can review your data and exercise your privacy choices.\nIt is meant as a helpful access point for viewing your personal data in the context of its use within Unity systems.\nFor those playing games where Unity ads appear, you may see the icon instead of the traditional information (\u201c\u2139\u201d) button.\nFor those using our software to build games, you may see it in a privacy dashboard.</p>I am a game developer that uses Unity software to build my game, what should I know?<p>You can access and update your information by logging into your Unity account on our website.\nWe use analytics services to understand how developers use our software in order to improve our software and services.\nWe also include certain device data collection in the runtime of the software, which is incorporated into the applications you create with the software.\nYou should be sure that your privacy policy explains to your players the variety of technical information that is collected and shared with third parties like Unity.\nIf you use Unity developer services such as Mobile Advertising, Unity Analytics, or deltaDNA services, read the applicable FAQs below and our&nbsp;Cookie Policy.</p>I visit Unity or its affiliates' websites, what should I know?<p>We collect log info, including IP address and device data, related to your visits to our site.\nWhen you post comments on our community pages and forums, other forum users will be able to see your username, photo and comments.\nWhen you post, you should assume that all the information you provide is public.</p>I play a game that was built with or uses certain Unity software, what should I know?<p>Unity has collected some or all of the following information about your device: unique device identifiers (e.g., IDFV for iOS devices and Android ID for Android devices).\nIP address.\ncountry of install (mapped from IP address).\ndevice manufacturer and model platform type (iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, etc.) and the operating system and version running on your system or device.\nlanguage.\nCPU information such as model, the number of CPUs present, frequency, and instruction set support flags.\nthe graphics card type and vendor name.\ngraphics card driver name and version (e.g., \u201cnv4disp.dll 6.10.93.71\u201d).\nwhich graphics API is in use (e.g., \u201cOpenGL 2.1\u201d or \u201cDirect3D 9.0c\u201d).\namount of system and video RAM present.\ncurrent screen resolution.\nversion of the Unity Editor used to create the game.\nsensor flags (e.g., device support for gyroscope, touch pressure or accelerometer).\napplication or bundle identification (\u201capp ID\u201d) of the game installed.\nunique advertising identifiers provided for iOS and Android devices (e.g., IDFA or Android Ad ID).\nand a checksum of all the data that gets sent to verify that it transmitted correctly.</p>\n<p>Some developers use Unity\u2019s Analytics, deltaDNA services and Ad services, which collect additional information (see FAQs on Unity Analytics, deltaDNA, and Unity Ads below for details).\nhowever, our usage of this data is largely for the following purposes.\nIn serving ads, we try to predict which ads will be of most interest to you based on the games you play and the ads you watch.\nFor Unity Analytics and deltaDNA, we assist developers to deliver the best game experience for you.\nFor example, game developers who use our software often standardize certain features to enhance game player experience, such as saving your place in a game.\nThis means that the game level you reached in your last session is where you will begin when you return to the game.\nDevelopers also need our assistance in tracking when you are eligible to redeem a reward within a game, such as when you have completed a challenge and get store credits to purchase new tools to play the game.\n&nbsp;In our Unity Analytics and deltaDNA services, some of your data points will also be rolled up into an anonymized, aggregated format to help game developers make decisions about how they support their games.\nFor example, if a game developer is considering phasing out support for an older version of iOS software, they may look at the total number of players currently using that version of iOS software to determine if they need to support that version in updates.&nbsp.\nAnother use on a per game basis is when a developer analyzes the numbers of players dropping out after a certain level.&nbsp.\nThe developer would use this information to look at the design of their game and re-assess if the game challenge is truly intuitive or needs some additional instruction for players.&nbsp.\nThis allows the developer to enhance the experience and retain the developer\u2019s customers better.</p>\n<p>Some Unity developers may collect your information independent of Unity.\nUnity does not have control over this information.\nIf you want to request access to or deletion of this information, then check each developer\u2019s app settings or website for instructions on how to make a request.</p>I play a game that uses Unity Analytics of deltaDNA, what do I need to know?<p>Unity has collected device information, like IP address and device identifiers, as well as events completed or actions taken within the game, including level, number of credits, time it took you to earn them, metadata about in-game communications and the value and details of purchases.\nUsing our systems, the developer of the game has ongoing access to this data.\nThis collection and use of data makes it possible for your experience to operate as expected by permitting you to do&nbsp;things like redeem rewards you have earned or return to where you left off in a game.\nOther Unity customers may have access to aggregated reports about game activity in general across a number of games.\nThese reports are based, in part, on your game activities, but do not specifically identify you or your device.\nThe reports described in this paragraph help developers make decisions on optimal methods to run the games they have made for you.\nFor example, the developer may need to know the types of devices running the game to determine how to support game updates on an ongoing basis.&nbsp;Some data collected by Unity Analytics or deltaDNA may be used by Unity Ads for personalized advertising.\nsee the FAQs related to advertising for more information.</p>I received an ad from Unity Ads, what do I need to know?<p>Unity Ads has probably collected device information, like IP address and device identifiers, and information regarding the delivery of ads and your interaction with them, all of which may be shared with ad publishers and attribution companies.\nFor clarity, Unity collects the following data: whether you click or tap an ad for a new game, whether you watch the ad or play a game frequently, whether others playing a game like the one you\u2019re playing have downloaded a particular new game, and whether you download and install the new game you see advertised.\nWhere a developer has enabled certain featues, Unity Ads may also collect your session information and monetization events.\nAll of this is for purposes of predicting the types of new games that you might like to download.\nUnity may track additional data about you in the future for purposes of making these types of predictions, and we will notify you prior to new data collection.</p>Do I have any choices regarding the data collection described above if I do not wish to see personalized ads?<p>If you are in the EU and do not wish to be targeted in this manner, the first Unity ad you see in an app (as of May 25, 2018) explains how you can opt-out of data collection in that particular game.\nYou can opt-out then or at any time by clicking or tapping the \u201c\u2139\u201d button (or Data Privacy icon) on any ad you see (the \u201c\u2139\u201d button or Data Privacy icon will also allow you to access the data that is collected about you in that particular app).\nFor example, you might see a summary&nbsp.\n&nbsp;that includes information indicating that&nbsp.\nwe see that you are using an iPhone 8 and you are playing from Germany.\nIn the past week we\u2019ve seen you 5 times in this game and have shown you 27 ads.\nYou have installed 0 games based on those ads.</p>\n<p>(Additionally, all users, regardless of their location, may opt-out of all personalized advertising by enabling privacy features on their devices such as Limit Ad Tracking (iOS) and Opt Out of Ads Personalization (Android).\nSee your device\u2019s Help system for more information.)</p>\n<p>Also, you may see certain \u201cbrand\u201d advertising within our ad network (a brand ad is advertising for products that are not games, such as ads for an airline travel deal or a soft drink).\nUnity gets these ads from third-party networks.\nWe do not permit these third parties to add your app usage to their marketing database, except for a few exceptions, which we specifically list in the Advertising Choices section of our Privacy Policy.\nThe small subset of third parties listed are clearly noted as being permitted by our contracts to use the fact that you play a particular game in their future targeting of ads to you for other non-Unity parties.\n&nbsp;The remaining parties listed have been clearly noted as not permitted to maintain data about the ad they served you through the Unity network for future use.&nbsp.\nPlease note that if you have told Unity not to target you or you have exercised choices directly with these third parties as described in our Advertising Choices section, this information will not be maintained or used by us or these third parties.\nPlease note that if you have elected to not have your data collected by Unity, we do not send your advertising identifier to any third party, and you will receive only contextual advertising inside our network.\nYou may also visit the third parties listed in our Privacy Policy (at the links we provide) to see the types of data that these parties have about you based on your device\u2019s advertising identifier.\nPlease review the section \u201cWhat are my privacy choices for advertising?\u201d below to learn more about how to exercise choice with regard to personalized ads.</p>I play a game that uses Unity Multiplayer, what do I need to know?<p>Unity has collected unique device identifiers, IP address (which may be matched to identify approximate location for matchmaking), as well as information regarding games played and match attributes.</p>What are device identifiers (like IDFA or fingerprints) and why do you collect them?<p>Like many other providers of mobile apps, instead of requiring users to create an account and log in to it each time they access one of our apps, Unity and others using our products may opt to recognize the user\u2019s device through various device identifiers.\nDevice identifiers are also used for functions that require Unity to recognize devices across various apps.</p>I use Unity\u2019s game replay service (Everyplay), what do I need to know?<p>A: Unity has sunset this service.</p>\n<p>I sell assets in the Unity Asset Store.\nWhat do I need to know?</p>\n<p>Unity has collected information about your device, including IP address, and your use of the Asset Store as well as any information you actively provided when you created your account.\nOur primary uses of your information will be to facilitate your placement of assets in the store and to ensure that you are paid in accordance with our agreement.\nOther uses might include sending you updates on changes or promotions in the Asset Store.\nYou can access and update your account info by logging in to the Asset Store and visiting the Publisher Administration page.\nAlso, when you publish or provide assets for licenses on the Asset Store, your seller name and other information in your Publisher profile will be visible.</p>I bought an asset in the Unity Asset Store.\nWhat should I know?<p>Unity has collected information about your device, including IP address, and your use of the Asset Store as well as any information you actively provided when you created your account.\nOur primary uses of your information will be to facilitate your access to the Asset Store and any assets you have purchased as well as to assure our developers selling assets on the Asset Store that we are effectively providing them due compensation.</p>\n<p>Other uses of this information might include sending you updates on changes or promotions in the Asset Store.\nYou can access and update your account info by logging in to the Asset Store and visiting your My Account page.\nYou can also adjust your settings to limit the types of marketing materials we send you or to remove your consent for receiving any advertising from Unity.</p>2.\nPrivacy Policy Overview<p>Unity Technologies and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively \u201cUnity\u201d) offer a variety of products, services, and websites for game Developers and game players that will be referred to in this policy as the \u201cService\u201d or \u201cServices.\u201d Because we would like to avoid excessive formality and make this

and is not intended to override them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy governs our information practices for the Service, which includes any websites, where a link to this policy is provided.\nIt describes how we collect, use, share, and protect information from Developers, players, ad recipients, or people browsing or using our sites (collectively \u201cUsers\u201d) when Users access or interact with or use our Service.\nThis Privacy Policy also applies to the personal data we collect offline, such as when you call us or interact with Unity in person, such as at an industry event or

Agreement</strong>\n<strong>1.1</strong>\n<p>This Unity Asset Store End User License Agreement (\u201cEULA\u201d) is a non-exclusive, legally binding end user license agreement between any individual or a single entity (\u201cEND-USER\u201d) that acquires a license to an Asset from the Unity Asset Store and either (a) Unity Technologies SF (\"Unity\").\nor, as the case may be (b) any third party (\u201cProvider\u201d) that offers and distributes its Assets via the Unity Asset Store.\nConsequently, this EULA shall apply regardless of whether a purchased Asset is produced by Unity or by a Provider (each, a \"Licensor\").\nThis EULA is therefore a non-exclusive, legally binding end user license agreement as the case may be between either (i) Unity and END-USER (in which case the term \"Licensor\" shall refer to Unity), or (ii) Provider and END-USER (in which case the term \"Licensor\" shall refer to Provider).</p>\n<strong>1.2</strong>\n<p>By installing, copying, accessing, downloading or otherwise using the Assets, END-USER agrees to be bound the provisions of this EULA.\nAll definitions of the Terms shall also apply in this EULA unless the context clearly provides for a different understanding.</p>\n<strong>1.3</strong>\n<p>The subject matter of this EULA is the licensing to END-USER of any Assets from Licensor via the Unity Asset Store.\nThe Assets are licensed, not sold.</p>\n<strong>1.4</strong>\n<p>END USER hereby acknowledges that in the event it acquires a license to an ASSET which in the Unity Asset Store is marked as an Asset which is distributed by Provider (as opposed to Unity), then Provider shall be considered as the Licensor of, such Asset and.\nconsequently, only Provider (as opposed to Unity) shall be responsible for any liability whatsoever under any EULA or any breach by Provider, including (without limitation) liability for infringement of any intellectual property rights, irrespective of the fact that Unity facilitates payment.</p>\n<strong>2.\nEND-USER's Rights and Obligations</strong>\n<strong>2.1</strong>\n<p>END-USER may use the licensed Assets only for their intended purpose.</p>\n<strong>2.2</strong>\n<p>2.2.1 Non-Restricted Assets.\nThe following concerns only Assets that are not Restricted Assets: Subject to the restrictions set forth in this EULA, Licensor hereby grants to the END-USER a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, and perpetual license to the Asset solely:</p>\n<p>(a) to incorporate the Asset, together with substantial, original content not obtained through the Unity Asset Store, into an electronic application or digital media that has a purpose, features, and functions beyond the display, performance, distribution, or use of Assets (\u201c<strong>\n<em>Licensed Product</em>\n</strong>\u201d) as an embedded component of that Licensed Product, such that the Asset does not comprise a substantial portion of the Licensed Product;</p>\n<p>(b) to reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, and distribute the Asset as incorporated and embedded in that Licensed Product;</p>\n<p>(c) to incorporate the Asset into physical advertising materials and reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit and distribute the Asset as incorporated into those materials solely for marketing purposes with respect to the Licensed Product;</p>\n<p>(d) monetize the Asset within and for use within a Licensed Product, including via in-app purchases.\nand</p>\n<p>(e) except as set forth in 2.2.1.1 below, modify the Assets in connection with (a), (b), (c), and (d).</p>\n<p>2.2.1.1 Limitations on License.\nWithout limiting the foregoing, END-USER may not, and has no right to,</p>\n<p>(a) share the costs related to purchasing an Asset and then let any third party that has contributed to such purchase use such Asset (forum pooling),</p>\n<p>(b) enable a customer or user of a Licensed Product to sell, transfer, distribute, lease, or lend the Assets for commercial gain or commercialize Assets within a Licensed Product,</p>\n<p>(c) without express authorization, monetize an Asset in a Licensed Product where the Licensed Product\u2019s primary purpose is to create user-generated content,</p>\n<p>(d) use, reproduce, duplicate, publicly display, publicly perform, copy, modify, adapt, translate, prepare derivative works of, distribute, transfer, license, sublicense, rent, lease, lend, sell, trade, resell, or otherwise commercialize or monetize any Asset except as expressly permitted in this EULA.</p>\n<p>(e) if the Asset is a software development kit (\u201c<strong>SDK</strong>\u201d), modify the SDK except as instructed or authorized by Provider in writing (including instruction or authorization in Asset documentation) or include the SDK within END-USER\u2019s Licensed Product at runtime.</p>\n<p>(f) without express authorization, use Assets in any digital representation of value, ownership, or contractual rights.</p>\n<p>2.2.2 Restricted Assets.\nThe following concerns only Restricted Assets: Restricted Assets have license terms different from other Assets.\nThose license terms are found in the materials accompanying Restricted Assets (\"Restricted Asset Terms\").\nFor clarity, to the extent Restricted Asset Terms are different from this EULA, the Restricted Asset Terms will control.\notherwise, this EULA will continue to apply.\nNo other use is licensed or permitted and END-USER may otherwise not use, reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, distribute, sublicense, rent, lease or lend Restricted Assets.\nWithout limitation of the foregoing it is emphasized that END-USER shall not be entitled to share the costs related to purchasing a Restricted Asset and then let any third party that has contributed to such purchase use such Restricted Asset (forum pooling).</p>\n<strong>2.3</strong>\n<p>2.3.1 EXCEPT FOR EXTENSION ASSETS, END-USER is granted a license to install and use Assets on an unlimited number of computers provided that these computers belong to END-USER.\nIf END USER chooses a \u201cmulti-entity\u201d tier for an Asset, this license grant will extend to any Affiliate of END USER, where \u201cAffiliate\u201d means, with respect to END USER, any entity that directly or indirectly Controls, is Controlled by, or is under common Control with END USER, where \u201cControl,\u201d \u201cControlled by,\u201d and \u201cunder common Control with\u201d mean possession, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, of the power to direct or cause the direction of management or policies of a person, whether through ownership of equity, voting, or other interests.\n\u201cAffiliate\u201d will also include any Contractor of END USER, provided that such Contractor\u2019s use is limited to work on the project for which Contractor is hired by END USER.</p>\n<p>2.3.2 END-USER is granted a single seat license to install and use any Asset categorized in the Asset Store as an \"Editor Extension\" \u201cScripting\u201d, or \u201cServices\u201d (collectively, \u201cExtension Asset\u201d) only on a maximum of 2 computers.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, Extension Assets are licensed on a per seat basis and may not be shared or used concurrently on more than 2 different computers.\nAs an exception, build farm servers and virtual machine instances used only for running, testing, or building projects with Extension Assets do not require separate seat license(s) or constitute use on more than 2 different computers.</p>\n<strong>2.4</strong>\n<p>An END-USER may use an Asset under SECTIONS 2.2 and 2.3, and may have a third party, including any \u201cwork-made-for-hire\u201d contractor or \u201cfreelancer\u201d (\u201cContractor\u201d), work on that Asset on its behalf.\nHowever, except for any \u201cmulti-entity\u201d Assets under Section 2.3.1, any Contractor working on a project for an END-USER must have license(s) to its own to the Asset, and, conversely, to use an Asset under SECTIONS 2.2 and 2.3, a person must have its own license to the Asset, regardless of whether a Contractor working on a project for that person had its own license to that Asset.\nFor example, a person who is a Contractor must have a seat license for an Extension Asset, and the person who is hirer of the Contractor must have a seat license for that Extension Asset.</p>\n<strong>2.5</strong>\n<p>Services SDKs: If END-USER downloads and integrates Services SDKs, END-USER may be required to accept a Licensor end user agreement and/or additional Licensor terms and conditions to use such services.</p>\n<strong>2.6</strong>\n<p>END-USER shall pay for the license to the Assets in accordance with the payment process provided in the Asset Store or otherwise indicated by the Asset Store.\nEND USER shall provide customary billing and tax

including applicable taxes by charging the credit card provided, either directly by Unity or indirectly, via a third party online payment processor.\nalternatively, payment may be made where available by redemption of valid credit(s) (credit(s)s are non-transferable) issued by the Asset Store or a third party payment processor.\nFor clarity, your payment to Unity for an Asset will satisfy your payment obligation with regard thereto, regardless of whether or not the Asset is published by Unity or a third party and regardless of whether the payment is made directly or through a third party online payment processor.\nVAT numbers cannot be added or changed after the purchase is completed.\nIf you are directed to a third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party\u2019s service and that third party\u2019s Privacy Policy.\nPlease review such third party\u2019s terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services.</p>\n<strong>2.7</strong>\n<p>Some components of Assets (whether developed by Unity or third parties) may also be governed by applicable open source software licenses.\nIn the event of a conflict between the applicable EULA and any such open source licenses, the open source software licenses shall prevail with respect to those components.</p>\n<strong>2.8</strong>\n<p>You agree that no modification or use of those Assets shall (a) infringe, misappropriate, or violate a third party\u2019s patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, moral rights, or other intellectual property
