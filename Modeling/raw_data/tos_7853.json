security technologies to protect data for the bank and for you, our customer.\nIt features password-controlled system entry, a VeriSign-issued Digital ID for the bank\u2019s server, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol for data encryption, a router loaded with a firewall to regulate the inflow and outflow of server traffic.</p>\nSecure Access and Verifying User Authenticity\n<p>To begin a session with the Online Banking server, the user must key in a Log-in ID and a password.\nOur IBS system uses a \u201c3 strikes and you\u2019re out\u201d lock-out mechanism to deter users from repeated login attempts.\nAfter three unsuccessful login attempts, the system locks the user out, requiring either a designated wait period or a phone call to the bank to verify the password before re-entry into the system.\nUpon successful login, the Digital ID from VeriSign, the experts in digital identification certificates, authenticates the user\u2019s identity and establishes a secure session with that visitor.</p>\nSecure Data Transfer\n<p>Once the server session is established, the user and the server are in a secured environment.\nBecause the server has been certified as a 128-bit secure server by VeriSign, data traveling between the user and the server is encrypted with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.\nWith SSL, data that travels between the Online Banking System and you is encrypted and can only be decrypted with the public and private key pair.\nIn short, the Online Banking server issues a public key to the end user\u2019s browser and creates a temporary private key.\nThese two keys are the only combination possible for that session.\nWhen the session is complete, they keys expire and the whole process starts over when a new end user makes a server session.\nWhenever, SSL is securing your communications, the browser will typically indicate the \u201csecure session\u201d by changing the appearance of a small padlock icon at the bottom of the screen from \u201copen\u201d to \u201clocked.\u201d What this means to you is that your communications are scrambled from your browser to the Online Banking servers at all times, so no unauthorized party can read the information as it is carried over the Internet.</p>\nRouter and Firewall\n<p>Requests must filter through a router and firewall before they are permitted to reach the server.\nA router, a piece of hardware, works in conjunction with the firewall, a piece of software, to block and direct traffic coming to the server.\nThe configuration begins by disallowing ALL traffic and then opens holes only when necessary to process acceptable data requests, such as retrieving web pages or sending customer requests to the Online Banking System.</p>\nCookies\n<p>During your use of the IBS, the Online Banking System will pass a \u201ccookie\u201d to your browser to identify you.\nWe do not (and cannot) use our cookies to obtain new information about you.\nA \u201ccookie\u201d is security data given to a browser by a web server and returned by the browser on subsequent transmissions to identify the user and encryption information.\nWhen you log onto the system, this cookie enables us to process multiple transactions during the session without you having to provide your Login ID and password for each individual transaction.\nAfter a predetermined amount of time set by our security system or when you log off, the session cookie is no longer accepted and the password must be re-entered.\nA new cookie is used for each session, so that no one can use the cookie to access your account.\nFor Cash Management users, a cookie may also be used to restrict access to a specific PC for conducting business transactions.</p>\nPhishing\n<p>Phishing is a form of e-mail fraud that criminals use to solicit your personal information to steal your identity.\nThese fraudulent e-mails often bear the logo of legitimate businesses and even link to fake corporate websites.\nBankSouth will NEVER ask for your password or social security number in an e-mail or over the phone.\nIf an e-mail asks for this information delete the email immediately and then run a virus scanner to protect your system.</p> Security Tips\nOnline Banking\n<p>Our Online Banking service has several effective security techniques that we encourage you to implement when using Online Banking:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Never reveal your password to anyone or leave your password anywhere that someone else can obtain or use it.</li>\n<li>Change your password on a regular basis.</li>\n<li>Use the LOGOUT button to end each Online Banking session.\nDo not use the Back Button to exit the site.</li>\n<li>Change your sessions timeout in User Options to a time that meets your needs.</li>\n<li>Never leave your session without logging out, even for a short time.</li>\n<li>Balance your account on a regular basis using Online Banking to ensure there are no discrepancies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nFraud Protection Related to COVID-19\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid clicking on links in unsolicited emails and be wary of email attachments.\nSee Using Caution with Email Attachments and Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Scams for more information.</li>\n<li>Use trusted sources\u2014such as legitimate, government websites\u2014for up-to-date, fact-based information about COVID-19.</li>\n<li>Do not reveal personal or financial information in email, and do not respond to email solicitations for this information.</li>\n<li>Verify a charity\u2019s authenticity before making donations.\nReview the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s page on Charity Scams for more information.</li>\n<li>Review CISA Insights on Risk Management for COVID-19 for more
