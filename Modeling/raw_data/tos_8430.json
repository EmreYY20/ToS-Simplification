you submit to the forum belongs to you, and you decide what permission to give others for it.\nBut at a minimum, you license the company to provide content that you submit to the forum to other users

the company, the company\u2019s special license ends when the last copy disappears from the company\u2019s backups, caches, and other systems.\nOur backups are typicly removed 7 days after their creation, unless downloaded by us for any other reason, typicly server migration, in which case these backups will be removed from our systems once imported or otherwise utilized.\nOther licenses you apply to content you submit, such as Creative Commons licenses, may continue after your content is removed.\nThose licenses may give others, or the company itself, the right to share your content through the forum again.</p>\n<p>Others who receive content you submit to the forum may violate the terms on which you license your content.\nYou agree that the company will not be liable to you for those violations or their consequences.</p>\nYour Responsibility\n<p>You agree to indemnify the company from legal claims by others related to your breach of these terms, or breach of these terms by others using your account on the forum.\nBoth you and the company agree to notify the other side of any legal claims for which you might have to indemnify the company as soon as possible.\nIf the

allow the company to control investigation, defense, and settlement of legal claims for which you would have to indemnify the company, and to cooperate with those efforts.\nThe company agrees not to agree to any settlement that admits fault for you or imposes obligations on you without your prior agreement.</p>\nDisclaimers\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>You accept all risk of using the forum and content on the forum.\nAs far as the law allows, the company and its suppliers provide the forum as is, without any warranty whatsoever.</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>The forum may hyperlink to and integrate forums

permission to use it, or pay you.\nYou agree not to submit feedback or suggestions that you believe might be confidential or proprietary, to you or others.\nWe, however, do not take any credit for any suggestions that you submit.</p>\nTermination\n<p>Either you or the company may end the agreement written out in these terms at any time.\nWhen our agreement ends, your permission to use the forum also ends.</p>\n<p>The following provisions survive the end of our agreement: Your Content, Feedback, Your Responsibility, Disclaimers, Limits on Liability, and General Terms.</p>\nDisputes\n<p>English Law will govern any dispute related to these terms or your use of the forum.</p>\nGeneral Terms\n<p>If a provision of these terms is unenforceable as written, but could be changed to make it enforceable, that provision should be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.\nOtherwise, that provision should be removed.</p>\n<p>You may not assign your agreement with the company.\nThe company may assign your agreement to any affiliate of the company, any other company that obtains control of the company, or any other company that buys assets of the company related to the forum.\nAny attempted assignment against these terms has no legal effect.</p>\n<p>Neither the exercise of any right under this Agreement, nor waiver of any breach of this Agreement, waives any other breach of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>These terms embody all the terms of agreement between you and the company about use of the forum.\nThese terms entirely replace any other agreements about your use of the forum, written or not.</p>\nContact\n<p>You may notify the company under these terms, and send questions to the company, at contact [at] amethystcraft [dot]

<p>Please treat this discussion forum with the same respect you would a public park.\nWe, too, are a shared community resource \u2014 a place to share skills, knowledge and interests through ongoing conversation.</p>\n<p>These are not hard and fast rules.\nThey are guidelines to aid the human judgment of our community and keep this a kind, friendly place for civilized public discourse.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Improve the Discussion <p>Help us make this a great place for discussion by always adding something positive to the discussion, however small.\nIf you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.</p>\n<p>One way to improve the discussion is by discovering ones that are already happening.\nSpend time browsing the topics here before replying or starting your own, and you\u2019ll have a better chance of meeting others who share your interests.</p>\n<p>The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too.\nBe respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Be Agreeable, Even When You Disagree <p>You may wish to respond by disagreeing.\nThat\u2019s fine.\nBut remember to <em>criticize ideas, not people</em>.\nPlease avoid:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name-calling</li>\n<li>Ad hominem attacks</li>\n<li>Responding to a post\u2019s tone instead of its actual content</li>\n<li>Knee-jerk contradiction</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Instead, provide thoughtful insights that improve the conversation.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Your Participation Counts <p>The conversations we have here set the tone for every new arrival.\nHelp us influence the future of this community by choosing to engage in discussions that make this forum an interesting place to be \u2014 and avoiding those that do not.</p>\n<p>Discourse provides tools that enable the community to collectively identify the best (and worst) contributions: bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, watching, muting and so forth.\nUse these tools to improve your own experience, and everyone else\u2019s, too.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s leave our community better than we found it.</p>\n<p>\n</p> If You See a Problem, Flag It <p>Moderators have special authority.\nthey are responsible for this forum.\nBut so are you.\nWith your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.</p>\n<p>When you see bad behavior, don\u2019t reply.\nReplying encourages bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone\u2019s time.\n<em>Just flag it</em>.\nIf enough flags accrue, action will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention.</p>\n<p>In order to maintain our community, moderators reserve the right to remove any content and any user account for any reason at any time.\nModerators do not preview new posts.\nthe moderators and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Always Be Civil <p>Nothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be civil.\nDon\u2019t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech.</li>\n<li>Keep it clean.\nDon\u2019t post anything obscene or sexually explicit.</li>\n<li>Respect each other.\nDon\u2019t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information.</li>\n<li>Respect our forum.\nDon\u2019t post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are not concrete terms with precise definitions \u2014 avoid even the <em>appearance</em> of any of these things.\nIf you\u2019re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of a major news site.</p>\n<p>This is a public forum, and search engines index these discussions.\nKeep the language, links, and images safe for family and friends.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Keep It Tidy <p>Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less cleaning up.\nSo:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don\u2019t start a topic in the wrong category.\nplease read the category definitions.</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t post no-content replies.</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t divert a topic by changing it midstream.</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t sign your posts \u2014 every post has your profile information attached to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rather than posting \u201c+1\u201d or \u201cAgreed\u201d, use the Like button.\nRather than taking an existing topic in a radically different direction, use Reply as a Linked Topic.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Post Only Your Own Stuff <p>You may not post anything digital that belongs to someone else without permission.\nYou may not post descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing someone\u2019s intellectual property (software, video, audio, images), or for breaking any other law.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Powered by You <p>This site is operated by your friendly local staff and <em>you</em>, the community.\nIf you have any further questions about how things should work here,
