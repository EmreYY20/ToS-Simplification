Conditions refer to the company \"Global Event Technologies\", referred to as \"get\" for short.\nVerbal agreements and assurances require written confirmation.\nChanges and additions to the contract must be made in writing.\nConflicting GTCs are hereby contradicted.\nThis also applies to the cancellation of this formal requirement.\nGender-specific synonyms used in these General Terms and Conditions apply equally to the female and male form.\nShould one or more provisions of the contract be or become invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, the validity of the remaining provisions shall not be affected thereby.\nThe invalid or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a valid provision which comes as close as possible to the economic purpose of the invalid or unenforceable clause.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Any disposal of the rights or obligations existing on the basis of the contract shall require the prior written consent of the respective other contracting party.\nHowever, the Contractor shall be entitled to transfer the contract to a company affiliated with the Contractor under group law without the consent of the Client.\nUnless otherwise agreed, the legal provisions applicable between entrepreneurs shall be governed exclusively by Austrian law, even if the order is executed abroad.\nAny disputes shall be settled by the competent court in Salzburg City (Austria).\nIn the event of a mediation that does not materialise or is broken off, Austrian law shall apply in any court proceedings that may be instituted.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The parties agree to conclude the following GTC as a service contract with effect for themselves and their respective legal successors.\nIt is noted that the present contract including its annexes shall take precedence over all other agreements, offers and annexes in the event of contradictions or difficulties of interpretation.\nIn addition, the General Terms and Conditions of \"GET\" shall apply.\nany conflicting General Terms and Conditions are expressly rejected.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u200b</p>\n<p>\u200b</p> 1.\nOperator Service B2B&nbsp.\n\u200b <p>Any customer/client of GET (\"AN\") for whom services in the area of hardware and software components are primarily provided shall be deemed to be the customer/client (AG) in these General Terms and Conditions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These General Terms and Conditions (GTC) shall apply to all current and future services provided by the Contractor to the Client, even if no express reference is made to the GTC in individual cases when the contract is concluded.\nThe Client's terms and conditions shall only apply if they have been explicitly accepted by the Contractor in writing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u200b</p> 2.\nScope of services \u200b <p>a.\nThe exact scope of the Contractor's services shall be specified in the respective individually agreed offer with the Client.\nUnless otherwise agreed, the Contractor shall have the option of providing its services around the clock or at predefined times.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\nb.\nThe Contractor shall provide services in the field of \"automatic data processing and information technology\".\nThe event segment is the primary area of activity, whereby payment and access control solutions for major events are offered, among other things.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\nc.\nThe basis for the provision of services by AN's facilities and technologies shall be the qualitative and quantitative service requirements as determined on the basis of the information provided by the Client.\nShould the Client's requirements change, the Contractor shall submit a corresponding offer at the Client's request.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<br>\nd.\nThe Contractor shall be entitled to change the equipment used to

each case.\nThis includes, in particular, services outside the Contractor's usual business hours, the analysis and elimination of malfunctions and errors that have arisen due to improper handling or operation by the Client or other circumstances for which the Contractor is not responsible.\nThis includes, for example, special circumstances which make the performance of the service more difficult and which the Principal could have recognised earlier, or conditions which impair the network connection, such as topographical conditions, defective superstructures, technical jamming transmitters and the like.\nLikewise, training services are generally not included in the services and require a separate agreement.\nIn the event of the aforementioned aggravating circumstances caused by a company commissioned by the Principal, the Contractor shall be free to carry out improvement work at its own discretion.\nthe additional expense incurred shall be invoiced to the Principal.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\nf.\nIf the Contractor arranges services of third parties at the Client's request, these contracts shall be concluded exclusively between the Client and the third party under

Contractor to the Client.\nThe warranty period for such deliveries shall be 6 months from handover.\nThe \"presumption of defectiveness\" (\u00a7 924 ABGB) is excluded by mutual agreement.\nFor any

8.\nTerms of use and liability&nbsp.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>a) Duty to share receipts: AG guarantees in principle that the system complies with the legal requirements applicable in Austria regarding the duty to share receipts for cash transactions (cf.\ngeneral case: customer can download receipts via individual login in the event portal).\nThe contractual partner is informed about the legal requirements applicable in the country of the event (= project location).\nThe contractual partner acknowledges that GET cannot be held liable for incomplete entries made by the contractual partner or third parties used by the contractual partner in the system provided by GET (get.manage) and shall fully indemnify and hold GET harmless in connection therewith.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u200b</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>b) Subletting of hardware (POS devices): If the contractual partner uses third parties to fulfil its business, it shall be entitled to sublet GET devices (hardware, software) for the specific project, whereby the contractual partner undertakes to use a pricing policy adapted to the circumstances, in accordance with GET's valuations or, in connection with the subletting of the devices, to identify it as the relevant contractual partner in each case.</p>\n<p>\u200b</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>c) Loss of hardware: It is acknowledged that if GET rental equipment is lost, even if only due to slight negligence, the contracting party shall be charged the GET sales price applicable at the time.\nIn the case of lost or stolen equipment, it is

respective operator to check the settings made on the terminal device (prices, articles, areas, etc.) before commissioning, GET shall not be held liable under any circumstances if incomplete or incorrect data (article prices, access authorisations, etc.) are entered, regardless of whether this can be traced back to GET, the contractual partner or sub-operator.\nIn principle, articles and prices may be changed by the contractual partner or GET at any time during the event via \"get.manage\" - GET shall not be held liable for any damage caused in connection with the different duration of the Internet-dependent effectiveness of the changes made.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>e) Information obligations towards end customers: The contractual partner is informed that it may

that there may be special legal regulations in this respect in the respective country of the event.\nIt is acknowledged that GET cannot be held liable in connection with any deadlines that are too short.\nthe same exemption from liability applies accordingly to fixed fees (contractual partner-B2C customer), whereby activation or withdrawal fees are to be mentioned as an example.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>g) Payment Service Provider: The contractual partner has concluded a Card Acceptance Agreement with a partner payment service provider of GET, which is attached as an annex to this Agreement.\nPart of this contract on card acceptance are the General Terms and Conditions for Card Acceptance, which impose comprehensive obligations on the contractual partner, in particular with regard to infrastructure, hardware, security, abuse control, data security, as well as due diligence obligations and information obligations.\nTo the extent that these obligations relate to technical arrangements, GET shall ensure, as part of its service via a separate contractual relationship with the payment service provider, that the agreed obligations are complied with insofar as they relate to this contract and are not expressly assigned to the contractual partner under the contract.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>h) Fees and Disbursement Policy: The Counterparty is responsible for informing itself about and complying with the legal requirements relating to fees charged and disbursement policies.\nThe contracting partner is free to demand payment as well as fees for certain products/transactions.\nTransaction fees in eCommerce are excluded.\nThese will not be implemented by GET under any circumstances.\nHere we refer again to the legal provisions.\nGET shall not be liable and shall be held harmless for any possible non-compliance with legal requirements.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>i) Contractual penalties: In the case of system implementation, the requirements (information) of the Client Success Manager and/or Project Manager responsible in each case must be met accordingly.\nIt is at the discretion of the respective Client Success Manager to set corresponding deadlines for the information required for system implementation, which shall be recorded by mutual agreement in the \"Event Timeline Sheet\".\nGET reserves the right to charge the current prices according to the \"Price List for Special Services\" (see point 11.a) for information sent too late after the deadline.</p>\n<p>\u200b</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> 9.\nRemuneration&nbsp.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>a) The remuneration and conditions to be paid by the Client shall result from the contract.\nThe statutory value added tax shall be charged additionally, if due.\n&nbsp;It is acknowledged that the project set-up on site or the system implementation will in principle only be carried out if all agreed payment deadlines and targets are met in full.\nRibbons / cards can only be ordered after the corresponding payment has been received.\nIn the event of late payment, deadlines cannot be met.</p>\n<p>\u200b</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>b) Unless otherwise agreed, travel times of the Contractor's employees shall be deemed to be working time.\nTravel times shall be remunerated at the agreed hourly rate.\nThe aforementioned rates shall change in accordance with the consumer price index 2015.\nIn addition, travel expenses and any accommodation costs shall be reimbursed by the Client according to actual expenditure.\nReimbursement of travel and incidental expenses shall be made against presentation of receipts at the latest.</p>\n<p>\u200b</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>c) The Contractor shall be entitled at any time to make the performance of the service dependent on the provision of advance payments or the provision of other securities by the Client in an appropriate amount.</p>\n<p>\u200b</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>d) Unless otherwise agreed in the contract, one-off payments shall be invoiced after the performance of the service and ongoing payments shall be invoiced quarterly in advance.\nThe invoices issued by the Contractor, including value added tax, shall be payable without any deductions and free of charges within 14 days of receipt of the invoice at the latest.\nFor partial invoices, the terms of payment stipulated for the entire order shall apply mutatis mutandis.\nA payment shall be deemed to have been made on the day on which the Contractor can dispose of it.\nIf the Client is in default with his payments, the Contractor shall be entitled to charge the statutory interest on arrears and to charge the Company all costs necessary for collection.\nIf the Client's default exceeds 14 days, the Contractor shall be entitled to suspend all services.\nFurthermore, the Contractor shall be entitled to demand immediate payment for all services already rendered, irrespective of any payment deadlines.\nThe Client shall not be entitled to a right of retention.\noffsetting by the Client shall be excluded.</p>\n<p>\u200b</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>e) All tax liabilities arising from the contractual relationship, such as legal transaction fees or withholding taxes, shall be borne by CU.\nShould the Contractor be held liable for such charges, the Client shall indemnify and hold the Contractor harmless.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u200b</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> 10.\nB2C Support \u200b <p>GET undertakes to answer B2C support enquiries, i.e.\nenquiries that end customers of the contractual partner address directly to GET, by e-mail about the project before and up to three months after project implementation (from the last day of the event) (= included B2C support package) as quickly and conscientiously as possible.\nAll enquiries received in writing during this full stop shall be processed as far as possible within 3 working days (Mon - Fri) of receipt.\n&nbsp;After expiry of the support package, the B2C support enquiries will be forwarded to the contact address provided by the contract partner in advance, provided that processing by the contract partner is possible due to the customer queries and problems.\n(Example: Remaining money of the payout request has not yet arrived.\nanswer of the contractual partner: there is a delay due to the late execution of the transfer).\nIn the event of a technical problem or a problem that must be solved by GET, GET shall take over the complete processing without being asked to do so, even after the expiry of the service package.\nIf these problems are the responsibility (sphere) of the contractual partner or have been triggered (e.g.\nno stable internet connection was provided for bank account payments) and therefore extraordinary processing - outside the period of the support package - is required, GET reserves the right to charge a fee of \u20ac 4.00 net per support case.\nThe same fee per support case can be charged if the contractual partner does not want to take over the processing after the expiry of the support period.\nIt should be noted that - should these processing fees be charged - GET can prove the processing cases as well as the processing time at any time upon request.&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u200b</p> 11.\nService description of the modules and trainings \u200b <p>a) Certain additional services (e.g.: late information, extra days of project managers, tech leads, on-site crew, travel to advance appointments) will be charged at the discretion of GET.\nThe prices are based on the daily rates.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition, the following costs will be incurred if the information is not received by the Contractor by the stated deadline.</p>\n<p>\u200b</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>per \"unit\" - 100 \u20ac - e.g.\nan additional company/operator created in the system because a trader was forgotten.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>per \"site\" - 50 \u20ac - Ex: special location of a trader, additional bar, additional sales area, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>per \"area\" - 50 \u20ac - e.g.: an additional access area to be checked for&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>per \"product\" in product list - 2 \u20ac - Ex: add more products to product list</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>per \"flag\" / scripting - 100 \u20ac - Example: adding an extra flag or adjusting the scripting</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u200b</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Furthermore, if additional training is requested by the contracting party before the start of the project and set-up (general terms and conditions), the conventional charging rates apply (project training: hourly rate for project manager.\ntravel: Travel flat rate for kilometres travelled, catering) shall apply.\nThe costs are borne by the client and everything is subject to availability.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u200b</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>b) If required, GET (Contractor) shall communicate with the Client a training and equipment handover time, at which corresponding employees and (sub-)stand operators shall appear for the necessary instructions.\nThis described equipment distribution and \"training\" of staff on site before the start of the project is included in the Operations Package.\nShould the \"training\" take place at an earlier point in time (anything before 6 days before the event or the start of set-up), point 11.a shall come into force.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u200b</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>c).\nSoftware</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Cashless (incl.\nPost-Pay)<br>\nis a payment system based on RFID technology, in which a visitor can make cashless payments at an event (project) by means of a wristband or card loaded with \"credits\" (=&gt.\nsee offer \"RFID tag\").\nThe visitor can load his wristband/card (if desired =&gt.\noptional chargeable feature - see offer) online before the event, or directly on site using cash or debit and credit cards.\nPayment transactions on site can subsequently be carried out directly with the loaded wristband/card, or (if desired =&gt.\noptional chargeable feature - see offer) additionally with the ATM/credit card (= open loop payment).\nIn order to be able to carry out this process, each Point of Sale will receive a cashless device from GET before the start of the event (rental price of this hardware included in the offer =&gt.\nobligatory, error-free return) including training.&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Access<br>\n- Access control at points predefined by the client with hardware from GET.<br>\n- The access authorisation is transferred to the RFID wristband/tag in advance, e.g.\nvia ticket swap.<br>\n- Can then be read by GET
