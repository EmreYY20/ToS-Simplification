for ongoing subscriptions will be issued whatsoever.\nSubscribers will retain access to the subscribed material until the end of the subscription period.\nIn order to keep the ability to access subscriptions, Subscribers will need to keep their accounts intact.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>For Stars:</strong> all payouts, if any in progress or available for the request, will be put on hold for 30 calendar days.\nWe use this time to settle all possible requests from the Subscribers for the paybacks and other disputes.\nIn case when conditions for the payout are not met (i.e.\nless than 5 subscribers and less than $50 collected pledges) - all pledges will not be reimbursed to the Star whatsoever and will remain in the Service.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>For both roles:</strong> all financial

attacking or bullying, either directly or by using your influence over others - within this platform or outside with the use of the platform or its parts - will lead to account suspension and investigation, which may result in subsequent profile/account termination.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Doxing.\n</strong>It is absolutely forbidden to aggregate and publish on this Platform any private personal or sensitive information of anybody, regardless of the fact if this person is our User or not or reveal the identity of such an individual without the explicit written consent, for the

sharing of any encrypted, private, or other data related to the Service's operations, including but not limited to tokens, cookies, codes, passwords, as well as an unauthorized share of the correspondence between Service and its Users without explicit and direct permission from the Service, will lead to an immediate and permanent ban from the Platform.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Fraud.</strong> Publishing, endorsing, or selling any fraudulent or misleading information or transmitting any digital substance or a code of a destructive nature on this Platform will lead to investigation and potential permanent termination of the account with the report to the appropriate authorities.\nWhile this Service has no intentions to follow, curate, investigate, check up on or make and extensive research on vast information published on the Platform, we will take actions in case the investigation - for one or another reason - is initiated.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Impersonation.</strong> Presenting

relationships.\n<strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n</strong>In case that requires both parties' involvement (i.e., Subscribers and Stars) either should initiate contact with the opponent/proponent by any possible means, avoiding any involvement from our side.\nIf such involvement is unavoidable, we reserve the right to proceed on whatever timeline and with whatever proposition we decide.<br>\n<br>In case when you, as a Subscriber or a Star having issues or concerns in regard to provided Services, we encourage you to contact us directly prior to initiating any related discussion online elsewhere.<br>\n<br>By agreeing to these Terms, you are waiving your right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or representative proceeding.\nWe, as a Company and as a Service, are also waiving these rights.<br>\n<br>For further information, refer to the \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d and \u201cIndemnity\u201d chapters.CopyrightWe do not review, audit, revise, or curate content published on SubscribeStar.com to determine if it is a fair use case (ref.\nto \"Limitations on exclusive rights\"), but we will normally remove the reported content if we receive a valid DMCA takedown notice.<br>\n<br>If you believe that a content creator on our Service is infringing on your copyright, please send a DMCA takedown notice to support@SubscribeStar.com to have the content removed.\nThis notice must comply with the requirements of section 512(c)(3)(A) of the DMCA.\nSuch notice will be immediately passed on to the content creator responsible for the creating/publishing of the artwork in question.<br>\n<br>We are giving the involved content creator 72 hours to handle a DMCA notice on their own before the Service will get directly involved.<br>\n<br>You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service or any contact on the website through which the Service is provided, without the express written permission by us, unless we stated otherwise.SubmissionsIf, at our request, you send certain specific submissions (e.g.\ncontest entries, proof of creative body of work, etc.) or without a request from us you send creative ideas, suggestions, proposals, plans, or other materials, whether online, by e-mail, by postal mail, or otherwise (collectively, \u201ccomments\u201d), you agree that we may, at any time, without restriction, edit, copy, publish, distribute, translate and otherwise use in any medium any comments that you forward to us.\nWe are and shall be under no obligation (1) to maintain any comments in confidence.\n(2) to pay compensation for any comments.\nor (3) to respond to any comments.<br>\n<br>You are solely responsible for any comments you make and their accuracy.\nWe take no responsibility and assume no liability for any comments posted by you or any third-party.Recurring BillingThe subscription mechanism of this Service is based on recurring billing.<br>\n<br>The recurring billing is enabled automatically after a Star gets five active Subscribers.\n<br>\n<br>Until then, the existing Subscribers have to manually initiate charge by going to My Subscriptions page and hitting the Pay action link found against the name of the Star in question in the Active Subscriptions section.<br>\n<br>The exact recurring charge date is not connected to the month's start nor to the end of it, but rather to the moment when subscription event has occurred.\nThe recurring billing date is determined by the Service at our sole discretion.\nNormally, recurring billing for each subscription runs roughly every 30 calendar days for each subscription instance.<br>\n<br>We reserve the right to suspend a recurring billing for the following cases:<ul>\n<li>When profile (i.e., Star) is not active for whatever reason for more than 14 days.</li>\n<li>If any activity associated with the account and/or profile are considered suspicious.\nTo determine transactions or activities suspicious, we may take into consideration any data provided to us by third parties or base our decision upon our own internal investigation.</li>\n</ul>TipsThe Tip is the form of a one-off pledge, that is dissociated from any subscription tier or subscription fee and can be set as a one-time payment with an arbitrary amount of money, up to $100 at once.<br>\n<br>Tips can be made by anybody to the Star who has Tips feature manually enabled by the Service staff.<br>\n<br>We are not obliged to enable the Tips feature while reserving the right to disable it at any moment.<br>\n<br>We take up to 30 calendar days to review Tips before processing and landing contributed funds to Star\u2019s account.SubscriptionsThe subscription fee (i.e., price of monthly subscription) will be charged according to the billing model chosen by the Star and introduced to the Subscriber upon subscription.\n<br>\n<br>The number of payments paid by the Subscriber and the total amount depends on the first date of each billing cycle and settings, whether it should be paid instantly upon subscription or otherwise.\n<br>\n<br>A monthly billing cycle can be defined as 28, 30, or 31 days regardless of the number of days in the following or current calendar month.<br>\n<br>When a Subscriber changes the subscription tier, a new subscription is initiated, canceling the initial one.\nIn other words, Subscribers pay as if they subscribe for the first time following the current billing model chosen by the Star.<br>\n<br>Every subscription has its own date and time, therefore multiple subscriptions will result in multiple charges, rather than in one batch charge.<br>\n<br>Prices for subscriptions are subject to change by Stars without notice.\nAny further disputes in regard to subscription price changes must be handled by the Subscribers with the Stars (i.e., content providers) directly via available e-mail or direct messaging.\nPlease, refer to our Refund Policy for further information.<br>\n<br>By becoming a Subscriber, you confirm that you use your own payment method that issued in your name and belongs to you.\nSubsequently, you agree to comply with our payment processors\u2019 rules and regulations in their entirety.<br>\n<br>None of the monthly subscriptions can run unverified and without a manual renewal by the Subscribers longer than 365 or 366 days for a leap-year, whichever is applicable.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>Every subscription must be reviewed and manually renewed by the associated Subscriber at least once per year.\nThis must be done on or before December 31st, or whenever requested by the Platform.<br>&nbsp;<br>The renewal is done via mechanism and on a schedule provided by the Platform.\nBoth mechanism and a schedule are unequivocally presented to each active Subscriber within the Platform and are applied to every subscription individually.<br>&nbsp;<br>The subscriptions will be put on hold until further developments if failed to be renewed in a timely manner.\nUpon subscription hold being initiated, all associated inbound and outbound funds flow will be stopped.<br>\n<br>If and when our attempt to charge the current payment method fails, we will repeat such an attempt within the next few hours.\nWhen such attempts are unsuccessful, the selected payment method is deemed faulty and will be marked as such in the Payment Options section of the Account Settings page.\nTo continue with the existing and future subscriptions, you will have to adjust a payment method by adding a previously used but updated credit/debit card.\nAlternatively, you can add a new card.\nAs soon as this change happens, we will automatically repeat our attempts to charge your updated preferred payment method unless the recurring billing was disabled.<br>\n<br>We may, at our sole discretion, limit or cancel subscriptions.UnsubscriptionsThe Subscriber can cancel subscription (i.e., unsubscribe) at any time.<br>\n<br>Upon unsubscribing from the Star, the Subscriber will lose access to the subscribed materials.<br>\n<br>If you believe you deserve a refund for a canceled subscription (i.e., unsubscription), please, refer to our&nbsp.\nRefund Policy for further information.<br>\n<br>Upon subscribing again to the same profile - no matter how short the period of time was between unsubscription and re-subscription - the Subscriber will be charged full price for the new subscription according to the subscription price set on the profile.Fees for SubscribersThere is no fee to start and run an account as a Subscriber with our Service.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>You can cancel your pledge (i.e., subscription) at any time.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>As a Subscriber, you will be charged Subscription Fee instantly upon subscription or according to the charging model selected by the Star.\nThereafter, this fee will be debited from your preferred payment option on a monthly basis (roughly - every 30 days).\nDepending on your location, some banks may charge you a Foreign Transaction Fee for your pledge, which will be assessed in addition to the pledge amount.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>The Foreign Transaction Fee is subject to change by the authorized institutions without prior notice.\nWe have no control over this charge.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>If you are located in the EU, then VAT is added to the final amount of subscription.\nThe exact amount of VAT is determined by the country you are resident of and is shown when you set up the initial pledge amount.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>The Platform handles collecting and paying out VAT.Fees for StarsThere is no fee to start and run an account as a Star with our Service.<br>\n<br>As a Star, you will need to set a Subscription Fee during the registering process.\nYou can change this fee at any time unless you have existing active subscribers.\nThe upper limit for the Subscription Fee is $100.<br>\n<br>Payment Processing Fees of 2.9% + $0.3 (3.5% + $0.3 for amounts greater than $30) will be applied to each transaction (i.e., Subscription, Tip) made toward Star's account.\nThis amount will be deducted from the Star's monthly earnings during the Payout.<br>\n<br>Additional fees may be associated with the Payout (see \u201cPayouts\u201d).Subscription TiersTo gradually reward your Subscribers, you can set a few Subscription Tiers, each with a different Subscription Fee.<br>\n<br>As a Subscriber, you can switch to a higher (i.e., upgrade) or lower (i.e., downgrade) Subscription Tier at any time, if multiple Subscription Tiers are set by the Star.<br>\n<br>While upgrading, the price difference between the Tiers will be debited from the preferred payment method.\nwhen downgrading, there won't be any credits issued for the price difference.<blockquote>Downgrading will result in instant revocation of access to all content previously available from the higher Tier.</blockquote>\n<br>Charges and billing date changes, or the absence of such, will be indicated during the upgrade or downgrade, so the Subscriber can make a conscious choice before proceeding with a switch.Payouts<strong>General Statements</strong>Payout is a process of sending funds collected on the Star's account to a chosen by this User financial instrument or institution (e.g., bank, eWallet).&nbsp;<br>\n<br>The payout can be issued exclusively to a person or organization that is the User who initially registered the account with the Service and who conducts the actual content publishing activities within the Platform.<br>\n<br>While in some exceptional cases, the payout can be issued to the payee different than the original User, there is no guarantee we will do that.<br>\n<br>We can transfer the funds accumulated in Star's account to the account of another Star upon request.\nIn this case, if sending Star is eligible for a 1099-K, this form will reflect only payments processed toward this Star, i.e., no transfers from this Star to other content creators will be reflected in the 1099-K.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>If we deem the information in our possession is insufficient for payout purposes, we may request additional identification or proof of substance from the payee.\nSuch documents may include Driver's License, State ID, National or International Passport, Citizenship, or National ID Card for individuals.\nAnd for the organization, the Articles of Incorporation, Certificate of Organization, or any other similar company formation documents may be requested.<br>\n<br>These documents are requested by our processing partners, who are subject to regulations by the higher financial authorities of the corresponding countries (e.g., the card brands, banks, NACHA, The Financial Conduct Authority, and similar institutions).\nThe requesting entity checks all received information against Money Laundering Act and other applicable policies.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>Providing this information may prevent our Users from being flagged as sanctioned individuals or organizations that belong to OFAC list, ones linked to fraud or other unlawful affairs.<br>\n<br>A User must meet the following criteria to be eligible for payouts:&nbsp;<ul>\n<li>Active profile (consistently deliver content or service to subscribers).</li>\n<li>Acceptable level of requested refunds (your subscribers shouldn\u2019t have a trend of requesting refunds).</li>\n<li>Acceptable level of chargebacks (not going over 1% of total transactions with initiated chargebacks).</li>\n<li>Submitted and verified Taxpayer Forms (W-9, W-8BEN, or W-8BEN-E, whichever applicable).</li>\n<li>Verified identity if requested (verification depends on a country of residence).</li>\n<li>The payout information is filled out in full and verified.</li>\n<li>A selected Payout Vendor can serve the User in their country of residence.</li>\n<li>The User doesn\u2019t violate the Payout Vendor\u2019s terms of their service.</li>\n<li>A selected Payout Vendor can provide the service of sending funds from the Service\u2019s account.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<strong>Additional conditions</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>The related profile has at least 5 active subscribers (can be subject to change per User request)</li>\n<li>The profile has at least USD150 in pledges collected (we may apply exceptions for different regions.\nfor example, the limit for creators from the United States can be set to USD30)</li>\n<li>At least 14 days have passed since the Star's account was initially approved</li>\n<li>At least 14 days have passed since we successfully processed the previously submitted payout request (we make exceptions per User request and often automatically lower this limit to 7 days)</li>\n</ol>Star must submit a request on the Payouts page to initiate the payout process.<br>\n<br>The exceptions from these conditions can be made upon request sent to support@subscribestar.com<br>\n<br>We reserve the right to deny or pause payout to any User until the matters in question are resolved, if:<ul>\n<li>The User failed to provide us with all required and requested information.</li>\n<li>If the information provided is false, omitted, incomplete, or suspicious in any other way (each as determined by the Service in its sole discretion).</li>\n<li>Whenever requested by the Service, the User failed to prove that all related activity on the Service is lawful, as governed by state or province of residence or by international law.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<strong>Timeframe</strong>Processing payout and delivering funds to the Star\u2019s bank account will take the time that depends on the country and payment vendors applicable to the Star\u2019s account.For the very first payout request, or when a payout method was changed or updated, there will be a 5 (five) business days delay from the date these changes took place.\nWe use this time to verify the information associated with the changes/updates.<br>\n<br>Payouts of less than USD20,000.00 will be initiated within the next 14 business days (on average it takes about 5 business days), following the day the request was submitted.\nBusiness days are counted based on the United States holidays/weekends official calendar as well as payment vendor\u2019s and Star\u2019s side.\nIt may take up to 14 business days for the payout to reach your bank account.\nTypically for ACH transfers it takes 1-3 business days, and for Wire - 1-10 business days.We may decide to break down to a few separate payments any payout requests that are equal to or more than USD20,000.00.\nWe take no less than 14 business days to process such batch payment.<blockquote>Whenever we detect an increased number of refunds toward a particular Star's profile or identify a risk of such an event happening in the foreseen future, we reserve rights to extend the payout processing period beyond 14 business days.</blockquote>\n<br>The amount equal to 10% of all funds collected by any particular Star can be held for 30 days without being able to be requested for disbursement if and when:<ol>\n<li>The refund rate related to this Star deemed to be \u201csignificant\u201d by the Service</li>\n<li>The content, advertised and promised to be delivered by this Star has failed to be delivered in a timely manner</li>\n</ol>To prevent any damages that may occur upon possible chargebacks, the Service may keep 10% of all effectively collected funds, but no less than USD35, for 30 business days before making them available to be included in the payout request.<br>\n<br>We reserve the right to take additional unlimited time to process the payout if:<ul>\n<li>The User has submitted incorrect, suspicious, or incomplete Taxpayer Identification forms.</li>\n<li>The User has submitted invalid or incomplete payout details.</li>\n<li>Any third-party institution (e.g., bank) or organization (e.g., money transfer service) involved in the payout process fails or delays in making the payment into the User account.</li>\n<li>The User who submitted the payout request isn't the actual owner of the receiving account.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<strong>Limits</strong>The minimum amount of the payout request is USD150, and the actual limit depends on the country and payment vendors applicable to the Star account.\nPlease contact support to know more about your specific case.The highest amount requested for the payout cannot be greater than the balance available for the payout.\nThe balance available for the payout is based on the proprietary algorithms of the Service and may change without notice.<br>\n<strong>Fees</strong>The User pays all and any fees and taxes associated with receiving money on their account.The Service takes the rights to deduct from the payouts:<ul>\n<li>Service Fee - 5% of all successfully processed pledges, (i.e., subscriptions, tips, and contributions) to the date of payout request.</li>\n<li>Payment Processing Fee (typically is 2.9% + USD0.3 per transaction, 3.5% + USD0.3 for transactions over USD30).</li>\n<li>Payout Fees associated with the payout.\nThe exact amount of this fee depends on the payout option selected by the User, current currency exchange rate, fees set by the related payment vendor.</li>\n<li>The total amount of refunded, disputed, incomplete, failed, fraudulent, suspicious payments/transactions or any expenses caused by such events and circumstances.</li>\n<li>Any payments/transactions made by mistake.</li>\n<li>Any pledges that were not deposited on the Service\u2019s bank account for any reason.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>If the payout to the content creator fails due to the reasons other than actions or inactions of the Service, we keep the rights to apply the following rules:<ol>\n<li>A subsequent payout request will be possible not earlier than the Service receives funds returned by the Star's bank to its account in full.\nThis time period is usually less than 2 (two) months but is almost never shorter than 2 (two) weeks due to the differences in processing practices of each financial institution involved in such transaction.</li>\n<li>All fees associated with such transaction will be deducted from the account of corresponding Star.</li>\n</ol>Per each transaction, Service takes rights to round:<ul>\n<li>Referral Associate commission amount.</li>\n<li>Payout amount.</li>\n<li>Service Fee amount.</li>\n</ul>Round-off error may vary within USD1.00.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Inactive Stars</strong>Those content creators who, in the current year:a) eligible for a payout (i.e., whose payable balance has reached a threshold of USD150);<br>AND<br>b) have not requested a payout within 6 (six) consecutive months for any reason, including wrong or missing information on tax forms, missing mailing address, etc.,<br>potentially, are subjects to the following:<ol>\n<li>Billing will be paused, which will effectively prevent these Stars from getting new Subscribers;</li>\n<li>Some fee will be applied monthly, with funds taken from the remaining balance of the corresponding accounts.\nThis fee originates from the fact that we, as a Company, responsible for paying the relevant taxes and other out-of-pocket costs related to keeping remaining balances in our business bank account.</li>\n</ol>The aforementioned actions aren't applicable if a Star:<ol>\n<li>informed us about such inactivity beforehand.</li>\n<li>joined the Platform between December 1 and December 31 of the current year.</li>\n</ol>HiatusAny Star can take a break in activities on the Platform - to go on vacation, take some time off, or leave for hiatus.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>We strongly advise any content creator to inform Service about such a break a few days ahead.&nbsp;<blockquote>It is imperative to announce the upcoming vacation a few days prior to leaving via message in a post pinned to Star's profile on SubscribeStar.</blockquote>\n<br>When Star leaves for hiatus, and it takes significantly more time than this Star has informed us about before leaving, the following happens:<ol>\n<li>All payouts - if any were in progress or initiated during this hiatus - could be put on hold, to be resumed in 30 calendar days automatically.</li>\n<li>Recurring billing will be paused until Star returns from the break and informs us about it via support@subscribestar.com.</li>\n</ol>Star can request a payout while being on longer-than-expected leave.&nbsp;Modifications to the Service and PricesWe

Service, all Content Providers (i.e., Stars) expressly agree that they will be responsible for paying a total amount of the refunds requested on their profile and all applicable fees.</p>\n<blockquote>All refund requests are subject to careful consideration, which may or may not result in a decision to issue the refund, depending on circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p>\n<br>The refunded amount will be taken from the related Content Provider\u2019s future payments.<br>\n<br>The refunded amount and associated fees will be deducted instantly from the Content Provider\u2019s account upon issuing the refund.</p>\n<blockquote>If, for any reason, any User reposts content they had access to on this Platform or elsewhere, with or without permission of the content owner, such a User will not be eligible for refunds.</blockquote>RefundsTo initiate refund, user has to contact us at support@subscribestar.com explicitly stating the reason for the refund, amount of the refund and details about the purchase it concerns.<br>\n<br>Once this request for refund is received and inspected, we will send an email to notify user that we have received his/her request.\nWe will also notify user by means of email message(s) of the approval or rejection of their request.\nAlthough normally we will explain the reasoning behind either decision, we reserve the right not to elaborate on this matter.<br>\n<br>If refund is approved, then it will be processed and a credit will automatically be applied to user's credit card or original method of payment, within a number of days specific for each case.<blockquote>Any and all complaints, claims, or refund requests submitted on behalf of a third party (e.g., your friend, associate, companion, family member, etc.) will be disregarded.\nTo file a complaint, the party that consider itself a victim side, should submit complaint by themselves, from the email address registered with the Service, supported by as many evidences as possible (e.g., screenshots, receipts, quotations, etc.).</blockquote>Late or Missing RefundsIn the event user has been issued a refund but haven\u2019t received one within the expected timeframe, user needs first check his/her bank account again before contacting SubscribeStar.<br>\n<br>Second step would be to contact a credit card company - it may take some time before a refund is officially posted.<br>\n<br>There is often some processing time before a refund is posted and visible in bank statement.\nTherefore the next step for the user should be contact his/her bank.<br>\n<br>After user has done all of this and still has not received a refund, he/she needs to contact us at support@subscribestar.com.Failed Promises<blockquote>We do not grant refunds for failure to deliver content on behalf of Stars.\nFor instance, if Star has promised to post certain amount of content per period and failed to do so, SubscribeStar is not responsible for the refunds for this undelivered content.</blockquote>\n<br>In the event when Star is unable to fulfill any or some of commitments or promises made to the users (i.e.\nsubscribers), Star may need to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution directly with each user in one or another way without making SubscribeStar involved in the process and/or holding liable for it.\nThis resolution may include refunding a subscription fees directly to subscriber/subscribers.Interpersonal RelationshipsStars and their respective Subscribers may get involved in interpersonal and sometimes quite close relationships, where we are not in a position to comment on, monitor, mentor, govern, or make any advice concerning such relationships.&nbsp;<blockquote>Any conflicts, disputes, arguments, disagreements, controversies, mutual accusations, breakups, fights, misunderstandings, and other sorts of disruptive interpersonal relationships between content creators (i.e., Stars) and their respective Subscribers - in real life or online - won't be considered as a basis for complaints, refund requests, or any other demands to act against the involved party.&nbsp;</blockquote>ThresholdIf the amounts earned by a Star on SubscribeStar exceed a certain threshold, and/or a Star has a high number of refunds or chargebacks (each as determined by SubscribeStar in its sole discretion), we may withhold a percentage of the subscription fees and tips accumulated to the date, for period of time as determined by SubscribeStar.\nMeanwhile, corresponding account may or may not be locked or subject to other limitations.Time FrameThe refund won't be granted if more than 30 (thirty) days have gone by since the purchase (i.e., subscription).", "created_at": "2023-07-14 19:18:32.714479", "updated_at":
