information<p>This section of the data privacy statement contains information on the scope of validity, the person responsible for data processing (controller), the data protection officer and data security.\nIt also begins with a list of definitions of important terms used in the data privacy statement.</p>1.\nDefinition of main terms<p>\n<strong>Browser:</strong> Computer program used to display websites (e.g.\nChrome, Firefox, Safari)</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies:</strong> Text files placed on the user\u2019s computer by the web server by means of the browser which is used.\nThe stored cookie information may contain both an identifier (cookie ID) for recognition purposes and content data, such as login status or information about websites visited.\nThe browser sends the cookie information back to the web server with each new request upon subsequent repeat visits to these sites.\nMost browsers accept cookies automatically.\nCookies can be managed using the browser functions (usually under \u201cOptions\u201d or \u201cSettings\u201d).\nThe storage of cookies may be disabled in this way or it may be made dependent on the user\u2019s approval in any given case or otherwise restricted.\nCookies may also be deleted at any time.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third countries:</strong> Countries outside of the European Union (EU)</p>\n<p>\n<strong>GDPR:</strong> Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), available here.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Personal data:</strong> Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.\nAn identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier, such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Profiling:</strong> Any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person\u2019s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Services:</strong> Our offers to which this data privacy statement applies (cf.\nScope of validity).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Tracking:</strong> The collection of data and their evaluation regarding the behaviour of visitors in response to our services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Tracking technologies:</strong> Actions can be tracked either via the activity records stored on our web servers (log files) or by collecting data from end devices via pixels, cookies or similar tracking technologies.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Processing:</strong> Any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Pixel:</strong> Pixels are also called tracking pixels, web beacons or web bugs.\nThese are small, invisible graphics in HTML emails or on websites.\nWhen a document is opened, this small image is downloaded from a server on the Internet and the download is registered there.\nThis allows the operator of the server to see if and when an email has been opened or a website has been visited.\nThis function is usually carried out by calling up a small program (JavaScript).\nCertain types of information can be detected on your computer system in this way and shared, such as the content of cookies, the time and date of the visit, and a description of the page on which the tracking pixel is located.</p>2.\nScope of validity<p>This data privacy statement applies to the following services:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our <strong>online offering \u201cWhoTracks\u200b.\u200bMe\u201d</strong> (website), mainly available at https://whotracks.me</li>\n<li>Whenever reference is made to this data privacy statement from one of our offers (e.g.\nwebsites, subdomains, links to third-party sites), regardless of the way in which it is accessed or used.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these offers are also collectively referred to as \u201cservices\u201d.</p>3.\nController<p>The following party is responsible for the processing of data in relation to the services, i.e.\nthe role of controller which involves determining the purposes and means of processing personal data:</p>\n<code>Ghostery GmbH\nArabellastra\u00dfe 23\n81925 M\u00fcnchen, Germany\nEmail: info@ghostery.com\n</code>4.\nData protection officer<p>The contact details of our data protection officer are given in paragraph 3.\nMessages should be marked for the attention of the data privacy department or sent via privacy@ghostery.com.</p>II.\nDetails of data processing1.\nGeneral information about the data processing operations<p>The following applies to all the processing operations listed below, unless stated otherwise:</p>a) No obligation to provide personal data &amp.\nconsequences of failure to provide such data<p>The provision of personal data is not required by law or contract, and you are under no obligation to provide any data.\nWe will inform you during the data entry process when personal information must be provided for the relevant service (e.g.\nby indicating \u201cmandatory field\u201d).\nIn cases where the provision of data is required, the consequence of not providing data will be that the service in question cannot be provided.\nOtherwise, failure to provide data may result in our inability to provide our services in the same form and quality.</p>b) Consent<p>In various cases, you may also grant us your consent to the further processing of data (or some of the data, where applicable) in connection with the operations listed below.\nIn this case, we will inform you separately in connection with the submission of the respective declaration of consent about all the procedures and the scope of the consent and concerning the purposes which we pursue in these processing operations.\nThe processing operations based on your consent are therefore not listed again here (Art.\n13 (4) GDPR).</p>c)\tTransfer of personal data to third countries<p>When we send data to third countries, i.e.\ncountries outside of the European Union, the data are then transmitted strictly in compliance with the statutory conditions of admissibility.\nIf the transmission of the data to a third country does not serve the purpose of fulfilling our contract with you, if we do not have your consent, if the transmission is not required for asserting, exercising or defending legal claims, and if no other exemption applies under Art.\n49 GDPR, we will only transmit your data to a third country if in possession of an adequacy decision pursuant to Art.\n45 GDPR or appropriate guarantees under Art.\n46 GDPR.\nIn order to ensure an adequate level of data protection, we provide appropriate safeguards pursuant to Art.\n46 (2) c) GDPR by the conclusion of EU standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission with the receiving body.\nCopies of the standard EU data protection clauses are available on the website of the European Commission here.</p>d)\tHosting at external service providers<p>Our data processing work is carried out to a large extent with the involvement of hosting service providers who provide us with storage space and processing capacities at their data centres and who also process personal data on our behalf according to our instructions.\nIt may be the case that personal data are transmitted to hosting service providers in respect of all of the functions listed below.\nThese service providers process data either exclusively in the EU or subject to guaranteed levels of data protection which we have put in place based on the standard EU data protection clauses (cf.\nsubsection c).</p>e)\tTransmission to government authorities<p>In principle, we do not transmit any data to government authorities.\nWe only send personal information to government authorities (including law enforcement agencies) when required to fulfil a legal obligation to which we are subject (legal basis: Art.\n6 (1) c) GDPR) or when it is necessary for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims (legal basis: Art.\n6 (1) f) GDPR).</p>f)\tPeriod of storage<p>The time specified in the \u201cperiod of storage\u201d paragraph indicates how long we use the data for the relevant purposes in any given case.\nAt the end of this period, the data will no longer be processed by us but will be erased at regular intervals, unless continued processing and storage are required by law (mainly because it is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims) or unless you grant us extended consent.</p>g)\tData categories<p>The category names listed below are used for specific types of data in the following sections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Contact data:</strong> Email address(es)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Access data:</strong> Date and time of visit to our services.\nthe page from which the system

relating to the computer system accessing the service: Internet Protocol address used (IP address), browser type, browser version, device type, operating system and similar technical information.</li>\n</ul>2.\nAccessing our services<p>The passages below set out how your personal data are processed when you access our services (e.g., loading and viewing the website, opening the mobile app and navigating within the app).\nWe would point out that it is impossible not to send access data to external content providers (cf.\nsubsection b) due to the technical processes involved in transmitting information over the Internet.\nThe third-party providers are themselves responsible for the privacy-compliant operation of the IT systems which they use.\nThe service providers are required to decide how long the data will be stored.</p>a)\tPurposes of data processing, legal basis, legitimate interests (where applicable), and period of storage<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Data
