where a different definition is noted, \"Personal Information\" means information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer, household, or device.</p>\n<p>Personal Information does not include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Publicly available information from government records.</li>\n<li>De-identified or aggregated consumer information.</li>\n<li>Other information excluded from the CCPA's scope, such as: <ul>\n<li>health or medical information covered by

\"Shine The Light\" law, permits consumers who are California residents, to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law), if any, that we disclosed in the preceding calendar year to third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes.\nOur disclosure requirements apply only if we share our consumers\u2019 personal information with third parties for them to directly market their own products to those consumers, instead of assisting us with our own business.\nIf you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, contact us as provided in the \"Contact Us\" section below.</p>3.\nCCPA Disclosures and Rights.\nDo Not Sell <p>This Section describes the categories and examples of Personal Information we collect, the sources of that Personal Information, the purposes for which we may have used that information, and the third parties with whom it may have been shared.</p>3.1 Personal Information We Collect<p>The following is a list of categories of Personal Information which may have been collected from consumers or users of our Services within the last twelve (12) months.\nThe categories and examples provided in the chart below are those defined in the CCPA.\nThis does not mean that all examples of that category of Personal Information were in fact collected but reflects our good faith belief to the best of our knowledge that some of that information may have been collected about consumers.\nWe will update this disclosure from time to time as appropriate.\n</p> Category Examples A.\nIdentifiers.A name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, account username, screen name, password, Social Security number, driver\u2019s license number, passport number, or other similar identifiers.\nB.\nPersonal information categories listed in the California Customer

maintained by an educational institution or party acting on its behalf, such as grades, transcripts, class lists, student schedules, student identification codes, student financial information, or student disciplinary records.\nK.\nInferences drawn from other personal information.Profile reflecting a person\u2019s preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, predispositions, behavior, attitudes, intelligence, abilities, and aptitudes.\n<p>In response to a verified consumer request for categories of information collected, we will investigate and provide an individualized response to the consumer, and will not merely refer the consumer to our general practices outlined in this Privacy Policy unless our response would be the same for all consumers and this Privacy Policy discloses all the information that is otherwise required for the response to such a consumer request.</p>3.2 Sources of Personal Information.<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Directly from you.\nFor example, during account registration from forms you complete, subscriptions you purchase or comments you provide on our Websites.</li>\n<li>Indirectly from you.\nFor example, from observing your actions on our

a consumer\u2019s personal information by the business to a third party for valuable consideration.\nor (B) sharing orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer\u2019s personal information with a third party, whether for valuable consideration or for no consideration, for the third party\u2019s commercial purposes.\"</p>\n<p>Within this meaning, we may have disclosed (as that term is defined by the CCPA) Personal Information in the categories below from consumers and users of our Services within the last twelve months where such disclosure may fall within the CCPA\u2019s definition of a \"sale.\" When we disclose that we may have sold Personal Information, it means that we may have received some kind of benefit to our company in return for sharing Personal Information, it does not necessarily mean we received any money in exchange.</p>\n<p>The categories below are those defined in the CCPA.\nThis does not mean that all examples of that category of Personal Information were in fact \"sold\" but reflects our good faith belief to the best of our knowledge that some of that information may have been shared for value in return.\nWe will update this disclosure from time to time as appropriate.</p>\n<p>In response to a verified consumer request for categories of Personal Information \"sold,\" we will investigate and provide an individualized response to the consumer, and will not merely refer the consumer to our general practices outlined in this Privacy Policy unless our response would be the same for all consumers and this Privacy Policy discloses all the information that is otherwise required for the response to such a consumer request.</p>Category<ol>\n<li>Identifiers.</li>\n<li>Personal information categories listed in the

collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes we will update this Privacy Policy.\n</p>\n<p>In response to a verified consumer request to know what Personal Information was collected or sold, we will investigate and provide an individualized response to the consumer, which will include the business or commercial purpose for collecting and/or sharing that information.\nWe

below in Contact Us.</p>\n<p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.</p>\n<p>The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.\nThis means that in making a request you may be required to: provide your email and phone number, customer information, and/or account sign-up authentication or other information needed to verify your identity depending on the sensitivity of the Personal Information that is the subject of the request.</p>\n<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.\nIf we are unable to verify your identity, we reserve the right to deny the request.\n</p>\n<p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.\nWe will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor\u2019s identity or authority to make the request.</p>\n<p>If you choose to use an authorized agent to submit a request to know or a request to delete your information, we may require that you: (1) provide the authorized agent written permission to do so.\nand (2) verify your own identity directly with us.\nWe will not require these steps if we have received proof that you have provided the authorized agent with a power of attorney

request\u2019s receipt.\nIf we cannot comply with any portion of a request, the response we provide will also explain why, if applicable.\nFor data portability requests, we will select a commercially reasonable format to provide your Personal Information that is commonly useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, but we do not guarantee that all formats are useable in all media.\nWe do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.\nIf we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>3.6.3 Non-Discrimination for the

written terms that describe the program\u2019s material aspects.\nParticipation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.\nDetails of the

providers, LiveRamp, Inc.\ncollects certain Personal Information from you on our Websites, such as your email (in hashed form), IP address or information about your browser or operating

provide a method to opt out of the collection of information across the networks of websites and online services in which we participate.\nUnless and until the law requires us to respond to browser Do Not Track signals, we will not respond to those signals as an opt out, but if we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so here.\nHowever, we do provide consumers with the ability to manage their cookie choices as described in our Cookie Policy.\nFor more information on Do Not Track, please visit allaboutdnt.com.</p>5.\nDo we use \"Cookies\"? <p>Yes.\nCookies and similar technologies are small files that a website or its service provider transfers to a computer\u2019s hard drive through a Web browser (if the user allows) that enables the website\u2019s or service provider\u2019s systems to recognize the user\u2019s browser and capture and remember certain information.</p>\n<p>In general, we and our third party providers and advertisers, use cookies and other technologies to optimize the functionality of the Websites, to help us understand how the Websites are used and to provide users with interest-based content or advertising based upon their browsing activities and interests.\nFor more information about the cookies and other technologies that we, our affiliates and third party providers and advertisers use on our Websites, please read our Cookie Policy.</p>6.\nSecurity <p>We use commercially reasonable procedures and various technical, administrative and physical safeguards to help protect the confidentiality of Personal Information.\nHowever, no data transmitted over the Internet or stored or maintained by us or our third-party service providers can be 100% secure given the reality of communication via technology systems.\nTherefore, although we believe the measures implemented by us are commercially reasonable and reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved, we do not promise or guarantee, and you should not expect, that your Personal Information or private communications sent to us over those systems will always remain private or secure.\nWe are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security features.</p>\n<p>If you believe that your Personal Information has been accessed or acquired by an unauthorized person, please promptly Contact Us so that necessary measures can quickly be taken.</p>7.\nThird Party Links <p>Our Websites or Services may contain links to other websites or services that are not owned or controlled by us, including links to social media platforms, or may redirect you off our Website away from our Services to other websites for information or other services.\nThis Privacy Policy only applies to information collected by our Websites and Services.\nWe are not responsible for the privacy and security practices of those other websites or social media platforms or the information they may collect (which may include IP address).\nYou should refer to such third parties\u2019 privacy policies on their sites to determine their respective privacy practices.\nLinks to any other website\u2019s or content do not constitute or imply an endorsement or recommendation by us of the linked website, social media platform, and/or content.</p>8.\nTransfers <p>Your Personal Information may be stored, transferred to, and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers.\nThese countries may be outside the United States, and may have different data protection laws than in the United States.</p>9.\nAggregate and De-Identified Information <p>We may aggregate and/or de-identify any information collected through the Websites and Services so that such information can no longer be linked to you or your device (\"Aggregate/De-Identified Information\").\nWe may use Aggregate/De-Identified Information for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also share such data with any third parties, including advertisers, promotional partners, and sponsors, in our discretion.</p>10.\nDo Not Sell

do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 (or 16 where applicable) through form submissions on our Websites or Services, although certain third party sites that

enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide information on our Websites without their permission.</p>\n<p>Involvement of parents: In accordance with the provisions of the
