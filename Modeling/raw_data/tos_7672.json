to time in our sole discretion.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(a)</strong>\n<em>Updates to the Terms.</em> If we update the Terms, we\u2019ll let you know by posting the updated Terms on the Site, to the App and/or may also send other communications.\nIt\u2019s important that you review the Terms whenever we update them or you use the Services.\nIf you continue to use the Services after we have posted updated Terms it means that you accept and agree to the changes.\nIf you don\u2019t agree to be bound by the changes, you may not use the Services anymore.\nBecause our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(b)</strong>\n<em>Updates to the Services.</em> We are

up.\nFinally, Section 7(e) makes clear that Neeva and our licensors are retaining all rights in what we make available to you.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.\nYour Data.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(a)</strong>\n<em>Posting Content.</em> Our Services may collect or allow users to submit, transmit or store information, data, content, and other

certain instances, some of your User Data may not be completely removed, and copies of your User Data may continue to exist on the Services.\nTo the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not

FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN NEEVA AND YOU.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Section 16</strong> states that any dispute between us will be decided under California law (and the Federal Arbitration Act) and that any dispute that isn\u2019t arbitrated will be heard in courts located in Santa Clara County, California.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.\nGoverning Law and Forum Choice.</strong> These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.\nExcept as otherwise expressly set forth in Section \u200e17 \u201cDispute Resolution,\u201d the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Neeva are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in the Santa Clara County, and you and Neeva each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.</p>\n<p>\n<em>As stated in the Introduction, under <strong>Section 17</strong> you and Neeva are agreeing to submit any dispute to an arbitrator under the rules of the American Arbitration Association.\nThe exceptions to that rule are claims that can be heard in small claims court and claims asking for an injunction.\nNote that if you win in arbitration, we may be required to pay your legal fees, but if we win, you don\u2019t have to pay ours (unless the arbitrator believes your claim was frivolous).\nYou and Neeva are also each waiving the right to assert a class action.\nAs always, we encourage you to reach out to us directly.\nWe want you to have a great experience!</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.\nDispute Resolution.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(a) </strong>\n<em>Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes</em>.\nWe each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, \u201cDisputes\u201d) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding.\nYou and Neeva agree that the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and Neeva are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.\nThis arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>(b) </strong>Exceptions.\nAs limited exceptions to Section \u200e17(a) above: (i)&nbsp;we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies.\nand (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(c)</strong>\n<em>Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules</em>.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the \u201cAAA Rules\u201d) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms.\nThe AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nA party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules.\nThe AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org.\nAny arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live unless we both agree to a different location.\nThe parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, and scope of this arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(d)</strong>\n<em>Arbitration Costs.</em> Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we won\u2019t seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous.\nIf we prevail in arbitration, we\u2019ll pay all of our attorneys\u2019 fees and costs and won\u2019t seek to recover them from you.\nIf you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(e)</strong>\n<em>Injunctive and Declaratory Relief</em>.\nExcept as provided in Section \u200e17(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim.\nTo the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.\nThe parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(f) </strong>\n<em>Class Action Waiver</em>.\nYOU AND NEEVA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nFurther, if the parties\u2019 Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person\u2019s claims with your claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nIf this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(g)</strong>\n<em>Severability</em>.\nWith the exception of any of the provisions in Section \u200e17(f) of these Terms (\u201cClass Action Waiver\u201d), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Section 18</strong> is a miscellaneous collection of terms.\nSection 18(a) states that we (and our licensors) own all rights in the Services and you won\u2019t remove or change any notices of those rights.\nSection 18(b) states that these Terms are the entire agreement between us and that you cannot transfer these Terms to someone else.\nSection 18(c) informs you how we\u2019ll provide you with notices.\nSection 18(d) explains that if we choose not to enforce these Terms in a certain case, we may still enforce them in other cases.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>18.\nGeneral Terms.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(a) </strong>\n<em>Reservation of Rights</em>.\nNeeva and its licensors exclusively own all right, title, and interest

assigns.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(c)</strong>\n<em>Notices</em>.\nAny notices or other communications provided by Neeva under these Terms will be given: (i)&nbsp;via email.\nor (ii)&nbsp;by posting to the Services.\nFor notices made by email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(d)</strong>\n<em>Waiver of Rights</em>.\nNeeva\u2019s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision.\nThe waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Neeva.\nExcept as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Section 19</strong> is self-explanatory.\nPlease don\u2019t hesitate to contact us.\nThank
