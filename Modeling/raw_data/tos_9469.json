otherwise expressly set forth in Section 14 \u201cDispute Resolution,\u201d the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Yuga Labs are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in the State of Delaware, and you and Yuga Labs each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.</p>\n<p>14.\nDispute Resolution.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(a) Informal Resolution of Disputes.\nYou and Yuga Labs must first attempt to resolve any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, \u201cDisputes\u201d) informally.\nAccordingly, neither you nor Yuga Labs may start a formal arbitration proceeding for at least sixty (60) days after one party notifies the other party of a claim in writing.\nAs part of this informal resolution process, you must deliver your written notices via first-class mail to us at

Terms.\nThe AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nA party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the

of this arbitration agreement.</li>\n<li>(e) Arbitration Costs.\nPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we won\u2019t seek to recover the

party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim.\nTo the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.\nThe parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.</li>\n<li>(g) Class Action Waiver.\nYOU AND YUGA LABS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nFurther, if the parties\u2019 Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person\u2019s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nIf this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.</li>\n<li>(h) Severability.\nWith the exception of any of the provisions in Section 14(g) of these Terms (\u201cClass Action Waiver\u201d), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>15.\nGeneral Terms.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(a) Reservation of Rights.\nYuga Labs and its licensors exclusively own all right,
