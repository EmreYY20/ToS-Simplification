Questions?\n</p> The Cloze Services <p> Cloze organizes and provides efficient means to access and receive updates regarding your contacts that may have been previously dispersed over many different Third Party Platforms.\n</p>\n<p> \u201cThird Party Platforms\u201d are software that integrate with our Services and that you have authorized to connect with Cloze.\nThis may include email, calendar, messaging, file storage, phone services, note taking, reminders, social networking, and other cloud services such as Office 365, Gmail, Slack, Facebook, Dropbox, Evernote and other similar platforms from which you authorize us to import, search, and access, content.\n</p> What Is Personal Information? <p> \u201cPersonal Information\u201d means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.\nan identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number or e-mail address, an identification number, location information, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.\n\u201cSensitive Personal Information\u201d means racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union members, the processing of genetic, biometric data for purposes of uniquely identifying a natural person, and information concerning an individual\u2019s health, sex life, or sexual orientation.\nWe treat your Personal and Sensitive Personal Information as confidential.\n</p>\n<p> \u201cOther Information\u201d is any information that is not Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information.\nPersonal Information does not include anonymized or \u201caggregate\u201d information, or publicly available information that has not been combined with Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information.\n</p> What Information Do We Collect And When Do We Collect It? <p> We may collect your Personal Information in the following circumstances:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> When you voluntarily provide it to us, such as when you register for an account by creating a username and password (\u201cCloze Login Credentials\u201d), send us an email or post information or other content to our Site or Service;.\n</li>\n<li> When you choose to sign in to, or create a Cloze account, using a Third Party Platform login (for example, by choosing the \u201cSign in with Google\u201d option on the Cloze website).\n</li>\n<li> When you connect a Third Party Platform with your Cloze account we may collect your credentials to that Third Party Platform if this is required in order to connect.\n</li>\n<li> If you apply for or purchase a Premium Service requiring billing or payment information on our Websites, we require that you provide certain additional Personal Information, including your address, phone number, and credit card number (\u201cPayment Information\u201d).\nThis information is necessary to process your requests and to contact you.\n</li>\n<li> We may also collect Personal Information about you from your employer when your employer engages us to provide the Services to you.\nFor example, we may obtain your name and email address from your employer.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> When you utilize the Services, we also receive certain Other Information about you or your use of the Services.\nSuch Other Information may be collected using various technologies, including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Logs:</b> We track the data you see in Cloze and how you interact with it by automatically collecting certain information such as, the pages you visit or features you use within the Services, the date and time of your activities on the Services, the URLs from the websites you visit before and after navigating to the Services, your software and hardware attributes (including operating system type and version, App version, device type, and device identifiers, including IDFA and/or Advertising IDs), your browser type and version, and your general geographic location derived through your IP address (e.g., your city, state, or metropolitan region).\nTo obtain such information, we may use web logs or applications that recognize your device and gather information about its online activity.\nWe treat this information as Private Data if we combine it with or link it to any of the your Personal Information.\nOtherwise, it is used in aggregate form only.\nWe use tracking data about individuals in an aggregated form to inform us about how Cloze is being used to help us provide a better user experience.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Cookies:</b> Like almost all websites today, Cloze uses cookies to determine whether you are logged in on your computer and to recognize repeat visitors.\nWe send cookies to your computer in order to uniquely identify your browser and improve the quality of our Services.\nCookies are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing a site.\nWe may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them).\nIf you wish to restrict or block the cookies which are set by Cloze, or by any other website, you can do this through your browser settings.\nPlease note, if you choose to disable cookies, some of our Services may not work properly or at all.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Web beacons:</b> The Services or the emails that you receive from us may use an application known as a \u201cweb beacon\u201d (also known as a \u201cclear gif\u201d or \u201cpixel tag\u201d).\nA web beacon is an electronic file that usually consists of a single-pixel image.\nIt can be embedded in a web page or in an email to transmit information.\nFor example, it allows an email sender to determine whether a user has opened a particular email.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Local storage:</b> We may collect and store information (including Personal Information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Cloze keeps Personal Information contained in your cookies and obtained through the other tracking technologies confidential.\nWe do not set any cookies outside of the cloze.com and clz.es domains.\n</p>\n<p> We also may partner with certain third parties to collect, analyze, and use some of the Personal and Other information described in this section.\nFor example, we may allow third parties to set cookies or use web beacons on the Services or in email communications from Cloze.\nThis information may be used for a variety of purposes, including analytics and online behavioral advertising.\n</p> Your Content <p> When you authorize Cloze to access Third Party Platforms, we collect, store, and process \u201cContent\u201d on your behalf.\nContent are all communication records and documents (including your contacts, messages, files, call records, notes, meetings, email and other similar information) from Third Party Platforms that you have authorized Cloze to access, similar information you directly enter in Cloze (for example, when sending emails, creating new contacts, adding notes, setting reminders, etc.), as well as information Cloze discovers and provides to you (for example, public information about your contacts, when contacts of yours open emails you sent from Cloze, etc.).\nBy its nature, Content will often contain Personal Information (for example, an email will contain the sender and recipient\u2019s email addresses).\n</p>\n<p> Cloze has no direct relationship with the individuals whose Personal Information is contained in your Content.\nAn individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to you.\nWe provide tools to allow you to export, delete, or update Content so you can comply with these requests.\n</p> How Do We Use the Information We Collect? <p> We use your Personal Information and Other Information collected through our Services for the following purposes:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> to enable you to share Content and communicate with other users.\n</li>\n<li> to provide our Services or information you request, and to process and complete any transactions.\n</li>\n<li> to respond to your emails, submissions, questions, comments, requests, and complaints and provide customer service.\n</li>\n<li> to monitor and analyze usage of the Services and trends, and to personalize and improve our Services and our users\u2019 experiences on our Services, such as content, or features that match their profiles or interests, and to increase the functionality and user friendliness of our Services.\n</li>\n<li> to send you confirmations, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages and otherwise facilitate your use of, and our administration and operation of, our Services.\n</li>\n<li> to contact you about the Services in which you have expressed interest or that might be of interest to you.\nand </li>\n<li> for any other purpose for which the information was collected.\n</li>\n</ul> What does Cloze do with your Content? <p> As with your Personal Information, we will treat your Content as confidential private data except for the uses and disclosures described in this Privacy Policy.\nYour Content is stored securely on our servers and will remain private to you, within your Cloze account, unless you choose to share or disclose it to another user or service, or as described below when you join a Cloze Business Team.\n</p>\n<p> We use a number of technologies to help you get the most out of the Service.\nOur systems automatically analyze your Content to power Cloze features and to continually improve the Service for you.\nThis may include, for example:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Making sure you find what you\u2019re looking for when you search your Content.\n</li>\n<li> Showing you the most relevant contacts in any given situation.\n</li>\n<li> Suggesting actions based on previous communication or other Content.\n</li>\n<li> Suggesting updates to your contacts with new or additional information.\nand </li>\n<li> Linking Content to relevant contacts so you see everything related to them.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> You may explicitly choose to share Content with other Cloze users or with Third Party Platforms.\n</p>\n<p> When you share Content with another Cloze user, Cloze provides privacy controls to allow to you to choose what information to share (by default, Cloze will not share the following Content with your co-workers: home or personal addresses from your contacts or messages from friends and families).\nThere are many privacy controls within Cloze that you can take advantage of to control what information gets shared and when.\nWhen you choose to share Content with other Cloze users, the shared Content becomes Private Data in their Cloze account as well as yours.\nHowever, there are no restrictions on these users from sharing that Private Data, through the Service or otherwise, with any third parties, or using that Private Data for any purpose.\nFor example, if you share a note with another Cloze user, they could copy, paste, and email that note to a colleague \u2013 just as if you email someone, they could forward that email to someone else.\nOnce you share Content with other users, there are no restrictions on those users from sharing that Content through the Services or otherwise with any third parties or using the Content for any purpose.\n</p>\n<p> When you authorize a Third Party Platform to access Content from your Cloze account (for example, to make contacts in your Cloze account available on another device), please be aware that those platforms are not operated by Cloze and Cloze is not responsible for the content or practices of those platforms.\nThe collection, use, and disclosure of your information will be subject to the privacy policies of the Third Party Platforms, and not this Policy.\n</p> What Content gets shared when you join a Cloze Business Team? <p> If you accept an invitation to join a Cloze Business Team, some of your Content, or aggregate information about your business-related Content, may be shared with other team members automatically, while other Content will only be shared if you choose to share it.\nSummary Information and some Contact Information may be shared automatically, while Communications Information will be shared only after you have been presented with the opportunity to approve or decline sharing.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Summary Information:</strong> Summary information may be visible to other team members at any time, but the content of your communication and your contact information will not be visible.\nSome examples of summary information are counts of the number of calls, emails, and other communication you have exchanged with business (not personal) contacts, and when you last communicated with a business (not personal) contact.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Contact Information:</strong> When you are assigned to follow-up with a business contact or you are added to a project or deal team, you will be notified, and business-related contact information (such as work email addresses \u2013 not home, personal, or private fields) may be shared with your team.\nYou can separately control whether communication will be visible to other team members.\nAny contacts that you have flagged as personal or private will never have contact information shared with your team.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Communications:</strong> Details of your communications with business contacts are only shared once you have been notified and have had a chance to either approve or deny sharing either in bulk or on a per message basis.\nCloze provides many privacy controls to allow you to choose what content is shared and when.\nAny contacts that you have flagged as personal or private will never have their communication information shared with your team.\n</li>\n</ul> What Information Do We Share With Third Parties? <p> Cloze exists to make your professional network more actionable, not to sell your data.\nHowever, we share personal information as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Service Providers, Agents and Related Third Parties:</strong> We sometimes hire other companies to help us provide the Services to you.\nExamples include third-party payment processors, companies who send emails on our behalf, and providers who are working with us in connection with the operation of our Services.\nSuch service providers are only provided with the information they need to perform their specific function, will only use your Personal Information to perform the services requested by us, and we make efforts to ensure they are subject to confidentiality restrictions consistent with this Privacy Policy.<strong>\n<em>\n</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Requests to other Cloze users (and non-users):</strong> Some communications you initiate through Cloze (e.g., an invitation sent to a non-user or a task you assign to another Cloze user) will list your primary email address and name in the header of the message.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Contact Enrichment:</strong> In order to ensure your contacts are as complete and accurate as possible, we may search for public information about your contacts in Third-Party Platforms you have connected to your Cloze account.\nIn addition, we may check for public information about your contacts from third party data providers.\nIn order to do so, we share a subset of information from your contacts (such as your contact\u2019s email address), but do not disclose any information about you to the data provider (the data provider does not know on whose behalf we are making the requests).\nIn such cases, we require such third parties to agree to confidentiality restrictions and to meet privacy standards at least as stringent as ours in protecting your data for such purpose.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your direct sharing of Personal Information through third-party websites and services:</strong> The Services may enable you to explicitly share Content with websites or online services operated by third parties.\nFor example, the Services contain links to third-party websites that incorporate comment and social media features.\nThe Services also contains a Facebook \u201clike\u201d button and a Twitter \u201cfollow\u201d button.\nIf you choose to use these features, you may disclose your personal information not just to those Third-Party Platforms, but also to their users and the public more generally.\nBecause these Third-Party Platforms are not operated by Cloze, Cloze is not responsible for the content or practices of those platforms.\nThe collection, use, and disclosure of your information will be subject to the privacy policies of the Third-Party Platforms, and not this Policy.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third-party plugins:</strong> The Services integrate certain third-party plug-ins (such as a Facebook \u201clike\u201d button).\nEven if you do not click on these plug-ins, they may collect information about you, such as your IP address and the pages that you view.\nThey also may set and/or access a cookie.\nThese plugins are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Facebook Custom Audiences and Similar Programs:</strong> We may partner with Facebook and other social media partners to deliver advertisements to our users via the Facebook Custom Audiences program or similar third-party programs.\nIn order to identify and reach our users on Facebook or another third-party service, we may share information such as an email address or phone number with Facebook or another third-party service.\nFor more information about custom audience targeting and how to adjust your social media advertising preferences, please review the privacy policy of your social media provider.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share your Personal Information when you give us your consent to do so, including if we notify you on our Services that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Legal Processes:</strong> We may also disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law or when we believe in good faith that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or legal processes or respond to lawful requests or legal authorities, including responding to lawful subpoenas, warrants or court orders.\nwhen we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or the rights, property or safety of others.\nto enforce or apply our Privacy Policy, our Terms of Service or our other policies or agreements.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Business Transfers:</strong> We might sell or buy business assets.\nWe may share your Personal Information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition, or in any other situation where Personal Information may be disclosed or transferred as one of the business assets of us.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Analytics:</strong> We partner with certain third parties to collect the Other Information discussed above and to engage in analysis, auditing, research, and reporting.\nThese third parties may use web logs or web beacons, and they may set and access cookies or use similar tracking technologies on your computer or other device.\nIn particular, our Services use Google Analytics and Mixpanel.\nYou may opt out of the use of cookies by Google Analytics here, and Mixpanel here.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Online Interest-Based Advertising:</strong> The Services also enable third-party tracking mechanisms to collect your Other Information for use in online interest-based advertising.\nFor example, third parties may use the fact that you visited our website or used our mobile app to target online ads to you.\nIn addition, our third-party advertising networks might use information about your use of our website or app to help target advertisements based on your online activity in general.\nFor information about interest-based advertising practices, including privacy and confidentiality, visit the Network Advertising Initiative website or the Digital Advertising Alliance website.\n</p>\n<p> The use of online tracking mechanisms by third parties is subject to those third parties\u2019 own privacy policies, and not this privacy policy.\nIf you prefer to prevent third parties from setting and accessing cookies on your computer or other device, you may set your browser to block cookies.\nAdditionally, you may remove yourself from the targeted advertising of companies within the Network Advertising Initiative by opting out here, or of companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance by opting out here.\nIf you are an individual of the EU, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, you may opt-out here.\nAlthough our Services currently do not respond to \u201cdo not track\u201d browser headers, you can limit tracking through these third-party programs and by taking the other steps discussed above.\n</p>\n<p> Please note that the opt-out will apply only to the specific browser or device from which you opt out, and therefore you will need to opt out separately on all of your browsers and devices.\nIf you delete or reset your cookies or mobile identifiers, change browsers, or use a different device, any opt-out cookie or tool may no longer work and you will have to opt out again.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Aggregated information:</strong> We may share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners.\nSuch aggregated information does not identify individual users.\nWe do not link this aggregate user data with personal information.\nOur Privacy Policy does not restrict or limit our collection and use of aggregate user data.\n</p> User Communications <p> You may choose to provide us with another person's e-mail address so that person may be invited to create an account on our Service.\nBy providing us with another person's e-mail address, you represent to us that you have obtained the consent of the person concerned as regards such disclosure to us of that e-mail address.\nWe may disclose such information if required to do so in order to comply with legal process, as described above.\n</p> Links to Other Sites <p> Our Services may contain links to other sites.\nAny Personal Information you provide on the linked pages is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party\u2019s privacy policy.\nOur Privacy Policy does not apply to such linked sites, and we are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of these sites or any other sites that are linked to from our Services.\n</p> What Steps Do We Take To Protect Your Information Online? <p> We use reasonable physical, technical, and administrative security measures to protect your Personal Information in an effort to prevent loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.\nPlease be aware, however, that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.\n</p> What Choices Do You Have Regarding the Use of Your Information? <p> You may withdraw your consent to process your Personal Information at any time.\nIf you do so, you will be unable to use the Services.\n</p>\n<p> You may \u201copt out\u201d of receiving marketing or promotional communications from us by following the instructions in those communications or by emailing us at unsubscribe@cloze.com.\nIf you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your Cloze account or our ongoing business relations.\n</p> Your Rights: Reviewing, Changing or Deleting Your Information <p> You may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in your account from within the Service itself or by contacting us at support@cloze.com.\nBy deleting your data in your account, we may deactivate your account.\nYou may request deletion of your data at any time.\nYour account will be closed after a period of inactivity of six months or such other period of time as we may choose from time to time.\nYou also authorize us, on your behalf, and in accordance with your account preferences to delete information when not reasonably needed for the Services.\nIf you have shared your Content with others and they have not deleted it, or it was copied or stored by other users, Cloze will not be obligated to delete such information.\n</p>\n<p> If you are an EEA or Swiss individual, you have the right to object to processing and to data portability, in some circumstances, as well as the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.\nThe EU Commission provides a list of supervisory authorities here: https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm.\n</p>\n<p> The supervisory authority in Ireland is the Irish Data Protection Commissioner.\nThe Irish Data Protection Commissioner may be contacted at info@dataprotection.ie.\n</p> Retention of Your Information <p> We retain information for as long as reasonably necessary to deliver our Services to you or to fulfill the purposes described in this Policy.\nYou may delete the Personal Information in your account as described above.\nPlease note that, in limited circumstances, we may retain information for a longer period of time as required by law.\n</p> Minors <p> Our Services are not directed to individuals under the age of 13.\nWe do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.\nIf a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information, he or she should contact us at support@cloze.com.\nIf we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will take steps to delete such information from our files.\n</p> Dispute Resolution <p> In compliance with the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles, Cloze commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your Personal Information.\nSwiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact Cloze at privacy@cloze.com.\n</p>\n<p> Cloze has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus.\nIf you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers for more information and to file a complaint.\n</p>\n<p> Under certain conditions more fully described on the Privacy Shield website, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.\n</p> International Transfer <p> The Services are operated from and hosted on servers located in the United States.\nYour information may be transferred around the world to countries in which we do business, including to affiliates, service providers or third parties, which may be located in jurisdictions that may not have the same level of data protection laws as those in your home country.\nBy using the Services or by providing any personal information to us, you expressly consent to such transfer and processing.\n</p> Information for European Economic Area and Swiss Users <p> Whenever we share information of European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) or Swiss users outside the EEA or Switzerland we make sure an adequate transfer mechanism is in place.\n</p>\n<p> Cloze continues to comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Information transferred from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States, respectively.\nCloze has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.\nIf there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.\nYou can learn more about the Privacy Shield program here, and to view our certification page, please visit here.\n</p>\n<p> In light of the Court of European Justice\u2019s July 16, 2020 Decision in the case of Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland Ltd, Maximillian Schrems, invalidating the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework as a program satisfying the requirements of Article 45 of the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union (\u201cGDPR\u201d), Cloze no longer relies on the

obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity.\nSuch third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.\n</p>\n<p> 4.\nThe parties do not object to a data subject being represented by an association or other body if the data subject so expressly wishes and if permitted by national law.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Clause 4</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Obligations of the

carried out in accordance with the relevant provisions of the applicable data protection law (and, where applicable, has been notified to the relevant authorities of the Member State where the data exporter is established) and does not violate the relevant provisions of that State.\n</p>\n<p> (b) that it has instructed and throughout the duration of the personal data-processing services will instruct the data importer to process the personal data transferred only on the data exporter\u2019s behalf and in accordance with the applicable data protection law and the Clauses.\n</p>\n<p> (c) that the data importer will provide sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 to this contract.\n</p>\n<p> (d) that after assessment of the requirements of the applicable data protection law, the security measures are appropriate to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing, and that these measures ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks presented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected having regard to the state of the art and the cost of their implementation.\n</p>\n<p> (e) that it will ensure compliance with the security measures.\n</p>\n<p> (f) that, if the transfer involves special categories of data, the data subject has been informed or will be informed before, or as soon as possible after, the transfer that its data could be transmitted to a third country not providing adequate protection within the meaning of Directive 95/46/EC.\n</p>\n<p> (g) to forward any notification received from the data importer or any sub-processor pursuant to Clause 5(b) and Clause 8(3) to the data protection supervisory authority if the

and a summary description of the security measures, as well as a copy of any contract for sub-processing services which has to be made in accordance with the Clauses, unless the Clauses or the contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information.\n</p>\n<p> (i) that, in the event of sub-processing, the processing activity is carried out in accordance with Clause 11 by a subprocessor providing at least the same level of protection for the personal data and the rights of data subject as the data importer under the Clauses.\nand\n</p>\n<p> (j) that it will ensure compliance with Clause 4(a) to (i).\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Clause 5</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Obligations of the data importer</strong>\n</p>\n<p> The data importer agrees and warrants:\n</p>\n<p> (a) to process the personal data only on behalf of the data exporter and in compliance with its instructions and the Clauses.\nif it cannot provide such compliance for whatever reasons, it agrees to inform promptly the data exporter of its inability to comply, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract.\n</p>\n<p> (b) that it has no reason to believe that the legislation applicable to it prevents it from fulfilling the instructions received from the data exporter and its obligations under the contract and that in the event of a change in this legislation which is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the warranties and obligations provided by the Clauses, it will promptly notify the change to the data exporter as soon as it is aware, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract.\n</p>\n<p> (c) that it has implemented the technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 before processing the personal data transferred.\n</p>\n<p> (d) that it will promptly notify the data exporter about:\n</p>\n<p> (i) any legally binding request for disclosure of the personal data by a law enforcement authority unless otherwise prohibited, such as a prohibition under criminal law to preserve the confidentiality of a law enforcement investigation.\n</p>\n<p> (ii) any accidental or unauthorised access.\nand\n</p>\n<p> (iii) any request received directly from the data subjects without responding to that request, unless it has been otherwise authorised to do so.\n</p>\n<p> (e) to deal promptly and properly with all inquiries from the data exporter relating to its processing of the personal data subject to the transfer and to abide by the advice of the supervisory authority with regard to the processing of the data transferred.\n</p>\n<p> (f) at the request of the data exporter to submit its data-processing facilities for audit of the processing activities covered by the Clauses which shall be carried out by the data exporter or an inspection body composed of independent members and in possession of the required professional qualifications bound by a duty of confidentiality, selected by the data exporter, where applicable, in agreement with the supervisory authority.\n</p>\n<p> (g) to make available to the data subject upon request a copy of the Clauses, or any existing contract for sub-processing, unless the Clauses or contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information, with the exception of Appendix 2 which shall be replaced by a summary description of the security measures in those cases where the data subject is unable to obtain a copy from the data exporter.\n</p>\n<p> (h) that, in the event of sub-processing, it has previously informed the data exporter and obtained its prior written consent.\n</p>\n<p> (i) that the processing services by the sub-processor will be carried out in accordance with Clause 11.\n</p>\n<p> (j) to send promptly a copy of any sub-processor agreement it concludes under the Clauses to the data exporter.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Clause 6</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Liability</strong>\n</p>\n<p> 1.\nThe parties agree that any data subject, who has suffered damage as a result of any breach of the obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 by any party or sub-processor is entitled to receive compensation from the data exporter for the damage suffered.\n</p>\n<p> 2.\nIf a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with paragraph 1 against the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his sub-processor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract of by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity.\nThe data importer may not rely on a breach by a sub-processor of its obligations in order to avoid its own liabilities.\n</p>\n<p> 3.\nIf a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data exporter or the data importer referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by the sub-processor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 because both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, the sub-processor agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data sub-processor with regard to its own processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the data exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity.\nThe liability of the sub-processor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Clause 7</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Mediation and jurisdiction</strong>\n</p>\n<p> 1.\nThe data importer agrees that if the data subject invokes against it third-party beneficiary rights and/or claims compensation for damages under the Clauses, the data importer will accept the decision of the data subject:\n</p>\n<p> (a) to refer the dispute to mediation, by an independent person or, where applicable, by the supervisory authority.\n</p>\n<p> (b) to refer the dispute to the courts in the Member State in which the data exporter is established.\n</p>\n<p> 2.\nThe parties agree that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice its substantive or procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with other provisions of national or international law.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Clause 8</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cooperation with supervisory authorities</strong>\n</p>\n<p> 1.\nThe data exporter agrees to deposit a copy of this contract with the supervisory authority if it so requests or if such deposit is required under the applicable data protection law.\n</p>\n<p> 2.\nThe parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the data importer, and of any sub-processor, which has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would apply to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection law.\n</p>\n<p> 3.\nThe data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of legislation applicable to it or any sub-processor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any sub-processor, pursuant to paragraph 2.\nIn such a case the data exporter shall be entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5(b).\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Clause 9</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Governing law</strong>\n</p>\n<p> The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Clause 10</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Variation of the contract</strong>\n</p>\n<p> The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses.\nThis does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Clause 11</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sub-processing</strong>\n</p>\n<p> 1.\nThe data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter.\nWhere the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the sub-processor which imposes the same obligations on the sub-processor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses (1).\nWhere the sub-processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the sub-processor\u2019s obligations under such agreement.\n</p>\n<p> 2.\nThe prior written contract between the data importer and the sub-processor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law.\nSuch third-party liability of the sub-processor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.\n</p>\n<p> 3.\nThe provisions relating to data protection aspects for sub-processing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.\n</p>\n<p> 4.\nThe data exporter shall keep a list of sub-processing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5(j), which shall be updated at least once a year.\nThe list shall be available to the data exporter\u2019s data protection supervisory authority.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Clause 12</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong> Obligation after the termination of personal data-processing services </strong>\n</p>\n<p> 1.\nThe parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data-processing services, the data importer and the sub-processor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred.\nIn that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore.\n</p>\n<p> 2.\nThe data importer and the sub-processor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data-processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Appendix 1 to the Standard Contractual Clauses</strong>\n</p>\n<p> This Appendix forms part of the
