\"document alert notification\", you should immediately access your account to examine provided copies of the documents to determine if there was an unapproved attack on title or if you recognize a title transaction as authorized and legitimate.\nSince this process is managed automatically by our proprietary software, it is imperative that you act diligently and immediately upon receiving a document alert notification and that you contact our team of resolution experts with notification of an unauthorized recording on your title.\nIf the new filing is the result of an action by your relative, you will be informed that the issue needs to be addressed directly between you and that person or entity.\nYou understand that we do not have any legal standing in the process of directly assessing or curing the title documents at issue and that we cannot guarantee results.\nHowever, we are committed to guiding you through the process with our experienced personnel to access and complete the necessary forms and to help you restore your title as intended.\nOn some occasions, the issues behind a document alert notification are caused by improper indexing, filing errors or typos during the filing process and may not be too complicated to resolve.\nIn other instances, unique complications caused by local rules and administrative requirements in any of the 3143 County Recorders offices, may cause our title experts to seek local legal advice to complete the rehabilitation of a subscribers title.\nHome Title Lock will consult with local attorneys, at our cost, to get the legal advice which they need to complete the process of achieving \u201cquiet title\u201d for our subscriber.\nThis is not legal advice to the subscriber, but advice that Home Title Lock use to see the process through to a successful conclusion.\nGenerally, as a subscriber, you will not even be aware of the legal advice given to Home Title Lock.\nAs the legal owner of the property, and the only one in the process with legal standing, you may, at your own discretion and at your own expense, retain legal counsel for advice during any phase of the process.\nUpon the completion of the process, your title will be returned to its original state and you will receive a new \"document alert notification\" reflecting the restoration result.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, HOME TITLE LOCK IS NOT AN INSURANCE PRODUCT.</p>\n<p>V.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS</p>\n<p>Home Title Lock press releases, presentations and printed remarks and materials are included on the Website for historical purposes
