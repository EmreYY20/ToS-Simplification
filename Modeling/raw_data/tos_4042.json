relief.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Severability.</strong>&nbsp.\nIf any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Survival of Agreement.</strong>&nbsp.\nThis Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Small Claims Court.</strong>&nbsp.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Courts.</strong>&nbsp.\nIn any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement
