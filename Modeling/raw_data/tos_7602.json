sites, mobile applications, and other online services (collectively, \"Platform\") made available by Thumbtack, including www.thumbtack.com.\nExcept as otherwise explicitly provided herein, this Policy applies only to information collected on or through the Platform, and it does not apply to information collected or obtained by or through any other means (including, without limitation, information collected offline, in person, over the telephone and/or by mail, or from third-parties outside the Platform).\nUndefined capitalized terms used herein shall have the definitions as set forth in our Terms of Use.\nBy accessing or using the Platform, you agree to this Policy.\nIF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE PLATFORM.\n</p> KEY TERMS <p> \"Content\" means text, graphics, images, music, software, audio, video, information or other materials, including but not limited to profile information, Pro Services requests, quotes, message threads, reviews,

otherwise uses the Platform to, or agrees to these Terms in order to, receive, pay for, review, or facilitate the receipt of Pro Services.\nBecause a Consumer may be, or may become, a customer of a Service Professional, a Consumer is often referred to as a \u201ccustomer\u201d or a \u201cCustomer\u201d on the Platform and in marketing materials related to the Platform.\"Platform\" means all Thumbtack websites, mobile or other applications, software, processes and any other services provided by or through Thumbtack.\n</p>\n<p> \"Pro Services\" means the services listed, quoted, scheduled,

or transmitted on or through the Platform by any User of the Platform, including but not limited to photographs, profile information, descriptions, postings, reviews, requests, messages, and payments

collect information in multiple ways including when you provide information directly to us, when you permit third-parties to provide information to us, and when we passively collect information from you, such as information collected from your browser or device.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Information You Provide Directly to Us</em>\n</p>\n<p> We may collect information from you during your use or access of the Platform, such as: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you register for an account;</li>\n<li>When you participate in polls or surveys;</li>\n<li>When you enroll for electronic newsletters;</li>\n<li>When you request a quote or other information;</li>\n<li>When you submit or respond to a quote;</li>\n<li>When you make a purchase;</li>\n<li>When you fill out any forms;</li>\n<li>When you enter a sweepstakes

us or other Users through the Platform.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> This list is illustrative, not exhaustive.\nthe Privacy Policy applies to all uses of the Platform.\n</p>\n<p> The information you provide directly to us may concern you or others and may include, but is not limited to: (a) name.\n(b) zip code.\n(c) email address.\n(d) home or business telephone number.\n(e) home, business or mailing address.\n(f) demographic information (e.g., gender, age, political preference, education, race or ethnic origin, and other information relevant to User surveys and/or offers).\n(g) date of birth.\n(h) insurance information.\n(i) photographs.\n(j) information about your project, home, request or need.\n(k) video or audio files.\n(l) in certain circumstances, payment and/or identity verification information.\nand/or (m) any other content you include in communications with other Users through the Platform or communications with us.\nIt may also include information specific to services you are requesting or offering through the Platform, such as a business name, service description, qualifications and credentials.\nYou are not required to provide us with such information, but certain features of the Platform may not be accessible or available, absent the provision of the requested information.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Information from Affiliates, Social Networking Sites, and Other Non-Affiliated Third-Parties</em>\n</p>\n<p> We may collect information about you or others through Thumbtack affiliates or through non-affiliated third-parties.\nFor example, you may be able to access the Platform through a social networking account, such as Facebook.\nIf you access the Platform through your Facebook account, you may allow us to have access to certain information in your Facebook profile.\nThis may include your name, profile picture, gender, networks, user IDs, list of friends, location, date of birth, email address, photos, videos, people you follow and/or who follow you, and/or your posts or \"likes.\" Social networking sites, such as Facebook, have their own policies for handling your information.\nFor a description of how these sites may use and disclose your information, including any information you make public, please consult those sites' privacy policies.\nWe have no control over how any third-party site uses or discloses the personal information it collects about you.\n</p>\n<p> We may collect information about you or others through non-affiliated third-parties.\nFor example, to the extent permitted by law, we may, in our sole discretion, ask for and collect supplemental information about you from third-parties, such as information about your credit from a credit bureau, or information to verify your identity or trustworthiness, or for other fraud or safety protection purposes.\nWe may combine information that we collect from you through the Platform with information that we obtain from such third-parties and information derived from any other products or services we provide.\n</p>\n<p> Through non-affiliated third-parties, we may also collect information that demonstrates the occurrence of an off-Platform communication between a Consumer and a Service Professional in order to ensure accurate charging of fees imposed upon Service Professionals and to enforce the Terms of Use.\nExcept as explicitly stated herein, we will not collect or store the contents of any off-Platform communication between a Consumer and a Service Professional.\n</p>\n<p> If you send text messages with a Consumer or Service Professional using the telephone number for that User available on the Platform, we may use a third-party service provider to track these text messages.\nWe track these text messages for fraud prevention, to ensure appropriate charging of fees, to enforce our Terms of Use, and for quality and training purposes.\nAs part of this process, Thumbtack and the third-party service provider will receive in real time and store data about your text message, including the date and time of the text message, your phone number, and the content of the text message.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Information That Is Passively or Automatically Collected</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Device/Usage Information.</em> We and our third-party service providers, which include ad networks and analytics companies such as DoubleClick and Google Analytics, may use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect information about the computers or devices (including mobile devices) you use to access the Platform.\nAs described further below, we may collect and analyze information including but not limited to (a) browser type.\n(b) ISP or operating system.\n(c) domain name.\n(d) access time.\n(e) referring or exit pages.\n(f) page views.\n(g) IP address.\n(h) unique device identifiers (e.g.\nIDFA or Android ID).\nand (i) the type of device that you use.\nWe may also track and record when and how frequently you access or use the Platform, or how you browse the Platform.\nWe use this information (including the information collected by our third-party service providers) for Platform analytics (including to determine which portions of the Platform are used most frequently and what our Users like/do not like), to assist in determining relevant advertising (both on and off the Platform), to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns, and as otherwise described in this Policy.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Location Information.</em>When you use the Platform, we may collect general location information (such as IP address).\nIf you install our mobile app, we may ask you to grant us access to your mobile device's geolocation data.\nIf you grant such permission, we may collect information about your precise geolocation, and we may use that information to improve the Platform, including providing you with location-based features (e.g.\nfor identification of Pro Services available near you).\nTo deliver customized content and advertising, we may share your location information with our agents, vendors, or advertisers.\nIf you access the Platform through a mobile device and you do not want your device to provide us with location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this.\nSee your device manufacturer's instructions for further details.\nIf you disable certain functions, you may be unable to use certain parts of the Platform.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Cookies and Other Electronic Technologies.</em>We and our third-party service providers may use cookies, clear GIFs, pixel tags, and other technologies that help us better understand User behavior, personalize preferences, perform research and analytics, and improve the Platform.\nThese technologies, for example, may allow us to tailor the Platform to your needs, save your password in password-protected areas, track the pages you visit, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Platform usage.\nWe also use certain of these technologies to deliver advertisements through the Platform that may interest you.\nWe or our third-party service providers also may use certain of these technologies in emails to our Users to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.\n</p>\n<p> We may also use local shared objects (also known as \"flash cookies\") to assist in delivering special content, such as video clips or animation.\nFlash cookies are stored on your device, but they are not managed through your web browser.\nTo learn more about how to manage flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe website and make changes at the Global Privacy Settings Panel.\n</p> HOW THUMBTACK USES THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT <p>We may use your information for any of the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For the purposes for which you provided

information you provide us upon signing up for an account differs from the information you provide us as part of the verification data we collect, we have sole discretion in determining which information will be displayed publicly on your profile.\nWe may combine information that we collect from you through the Platform with information that we obtain from affiliated and non-affiliated third-parties, and information derived from any other products or services we provide.\n</p>\n<p> We may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected through the Platform.\nWe may use de-identified or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes and may also share such data with any third-parties, including without limitation, advertisers, promotional partners, sponsors, event promoters, and/or others.\n</p>\n<p> We may, either directly or through third-parties we engage to provide services to us, review, scan, or analyze your communications with other Users exchanged via the Platform or as otherwise described in this Policy for fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation, product development, research and User support purposes.\nFor example, as part of our fraud prevention efforts, we may scan and analyze messages to prevent fraud or improper actions.\nWe may also scan, review or analyze messages for research and product development purposes, as well as to debug, improve and expand product offerings.\nBy using the Platform or engaging in off-Platform communications tracked by Thumbtack, you consent that Thumbtack, in its sole discretion, may, either directly or through third-parties we engage to provide services to us, review, scan, analyze, and store your communications, whether done manually or through automated means.\n</p> WHEN THUMBTACK DISCLOSES YOUR INFORMATION <p> Unless otherwise described in this Policy, we may also share the information that we collect from you through the Platform as follows: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Affiliates.\nWe may share your information with any Thumbtack affiliates.</li>\n<li> Consent.\nWe may disclose your information to nonaffiliated third-parties based on your consent to do so.\nSuch consent includes the disclosure of your information (a) in order to provide services or products that you have requested (please see

Providers.\nWe may provide access to your information to select third-parties who perform services on our behalf.\nThese third-parties provide a variety of services to us including without limitation billing, sales, marketing, advertising, market research, fulfillment, data storage, analysis and processing, identity verification, fraud and safety protection and legal services.\nAs we retain new service providers, we generally seek contractual assurances from these service providers that they will not use your information in any manner other than to help us provide you with the services and products available from Thumbtack.\n</li>\n<li> Legal Requirements.\nWe may disclose your information when required by law or when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process we receive.\n(b) establish or exercise our legal rights including enforcing and administering agreements with Users.\nor (c) defend Thumbtack against legal claims.\nIf we are required by law to disclose your information, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you unless (1) we believe in our sole discretion that providing notice could create a risk of injury or death, or that harm or fraud could be directed to Thumbtack or Users.\nor (2) we are precluded from providing notice by law.\nWe will attempt to provide the notice by email if you have given us an email address.\nWhile you may challenge the disclosure request, please be advised we may still be legally required to turn over your information.\n</li>\n<li> Protection of Thumbtack and Others.\nWe may disclose your information to whomever necessary when we believe it appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the Terms of Use or any other legal terms governing use of the Platform, and/or to protect our rights and property and the rights and property of other Users.\n</li>\n<li> Business Transfers.\nAs we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses, or sell some or all of our assets.\nIn such contemplated or actual transactions or where there is any change of control of Thumbtack, User information may be among the shared and/or transferred assets.\n</li>\n<li> App Store Providers.\nWe may provide your identity and mobile device identifier to third-party app store providers (for example, the Apple App Store) to allow you to download our mobile apps.\n</li>\n<li> Academics and Research.\nWe may provide information about Users to third-parties for academic and research purposes, in anonymized or aggregated form.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Please be advised that some information you provide and/or that we collect will be publicly accessible.\nFor instance, registration for an account requires that you provide us with your name.\nIf you register through Facebook, the Platform will use the name associated with your Facebook account.\nYour name (full name, or in some instances, your first name and last initial) may be visible to other Users.\nDepending on the circumstances, your name may be attached to your Content or information, such as scheduling of Pro Services, service requests, reviews, participating in discussions or forums, messaging, and profile information.\nCertain other people, including other Users with whom you have interacted via the Platform, will see information about you that is attached to your name.\nFor example (but without limitation), if you are a Consumer seeking Pro Services, the description you provide of your desired services, along with your name, will be shown to some Service Professionals registered in the relevant category along with your name.\nThus, other Users may be able to personally identify you based on Content you provide.\nSimilarly, the information we collect, including but not limited to when you last accessed the Platform, may be shared with other Users with whom you are interacting or otherwise made public.\n</p>\n<p> We invite you to post Content on or through our Platform, including, but not limited to, your comments, pictures, Service Professional profile, and any other information.\nHowever, please be careful and responsible whenever you are online.\nIf you choose to post User Content on or through the Platform, such as through User-to-User messaging or through our review boards, forums, blogs, or other postings, that information: (a) may be or may become publicly available.\n(b) may be collected and used by third-parties with or without our knowledge.\nand (c) may be used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law, or your personal privacy.\n</p> ONLINE ANALYTICS AND TAILORED ADVERTISING <p>\n<em>Analytics</em>\n</p>\n<p> We may use third-party web analytics services on the Platform, such as those of Google Analytics.\nThese service providers use the sort of technology described in the sections above to help us analyze how Users use the Platform, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive.\nThe information collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Platform.\nWe also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to advertising, as described in the following section.\nTo prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Tailored Advertising</em>\n</p>\n<p> Third-parties whose products or services are accessible or marketed via the Platform may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the Platform in order to (a) inform, optimize, and serve marketing content based on past visits to our websites and other sites and (b) report how our marketing content impressions, other uses of marketing services, and interactions with these marketing impressions and marketing services are related to visits to our websites.\nWe also allow other third-parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick, Facebook and others) to serve tailored marketing to you and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Platform.\nWe neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Platform by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third-parties.\nThose parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising as described below.\nYou may receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser.\nCookies may be associated with de-identified data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) that we may share with a service provider in hashed, non-human-readable form.\n</p>\n<p> If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored marketing, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative's Consumer Opt-Out Link and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance's Consumer Opt-Out Link to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs.\nTo opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads, you can visit the Google Ads Settings page page.\nPlease note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Platform, you may still receive advertising content even if you opt out of tailored advertising.\nIn that case, the advertising content will just not be tailored to your interests.\nAlso, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.\nIf your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective.\nAdditional information is available on NAI's and DAA's websites, accessible by the above links.\n</p>\n<p> When using a mobile application you may also receive tailored in-application advertising content.\nEach operating system (iOS for Apple devices, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices) provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application marketing content.\nYou may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertising.\nFor any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact the applicable platform operator.\n</p> PRIVACY OF MINORS <p> Our services are not designed for minors under the age of 18.\nOnly persons 18 years of age or older may use the Platform.\nIf we discover that an individual under 18 has provided us with personal information, we will close the account and delete that individual\u2019s personal information to the extent required by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.\nWe may, where permitted by law, retain certain information internally for purposes described in this Policy.\n</p> SECURITY <p> We employ physical, procedural, and technological security measures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure.\nThumbtack may use encryption, passwords, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure.\nNo security measures, however, are 100% failsafe.\nTherefore, we do not promise and cannot guarantee, and thus you should not expect, that your personal information or communications will not be collected, disclosed and/or used by others.\nYou should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, keeping your log-in and password private, and not recycling passwords from other websites or accounts.\nThumbtack is not responsible for the unauthorized use of your information nor for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords, or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.\n</p> LINKS TO EXTERNAL PLATFORMS <p> The Platform may contain links to other websites or resources over which Thumbtack does not have any control.\nSuch links do not constitute an endorsement by Thumbtack of those external websites.\nYou acknowledge that Thumbtack is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and further agree that Thumbtack is not responsible for the content of such external websites or the protection and privacy of information you provide while visiting such external websites.\n</p> UPDATING, DELETING, AND CORRECTING YOUR INFORMATION <p> You may review, correct, and delete certain information about you by logging in to the Platform and navigating to your preferences page in \"Your Dashboard.\" You must promptly update your account information if it changes or is inaccurate.\nUpon your request, we will close your account and remove your profile information from view as soon as reasonably possible.\nWe may retain information from closed accounts in order to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations of any User, enforce our Terms of Use, and/or for any other purposes otherwise permitted by law that we deem necessary in our sole discretion.\nYou should understand, however, that once you transmit User Content through the Platform, you may not be able to change or remove it.\nOnce we have deactivated or removed your account, you agree that Thumbtack will not be responsible to you for retaining information related to your account.\n</p> YOUR CHOICES <p> We may send periodic emails to you.\nYou may opt out of promotional emails by following the opt-out instructions contained in the email.\nPlease note that it may take up to 10 business

Fees.</p>\n<p> Service Professionals can pay Fees to Thumbtack in order to receive certain services on the Platform, including but not limited to receiving contacts, bookings or payments from Consumers or other individuals.\nAs a Service Professional, Thumbtack will automatically charge your stored payment method when those Consumers or other individuals contact you or make a booking with you concerning a Pro Service that matches the targeting preferences you set with us.\nThumbtack may also charge other types of Fees that you have previously agreed to (for example, cancellation fees or fees for services such as Front Desk) to your stored payment method or as deduction from your Thumbtack balance.\nFees may also be deducted from the total amount a Consumer pays for a particular Pro Service.\nIn order to use Thumbtack, you must have at least one valid payment method stored on file and the storage of such payment method is subject to our Stored Payment Terms and Conditions.\nAs described more fully below, you may also be required to set a weekly spending limit or Budget (as defined below).\nExcept as otherwise described herein or in our Refund Policy, all sales and Fees on Thumbtack are final and non-refundable.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Budget for Service Professionals</em>.\nAs a Service Professional, Thumbtack may require you to set one or more weekly spending limits (\u201cBudgets\u201d) for how much you are willing to spend on certain Fees over a specific period (\u201cBudget Period\u201d).\nThe types of leads or other Fees that count against your Budget will be disclosed to you at the time you set your Budget.\nYou understand that Thumbtack may charge your stored payment method in excess of your Budgets if such charges relate to Fees not covered by your budget (including for \u201copportunities\u201d contacts or for commission-based Fees), or if you otherwise give Thumbtack permission to do so.\nYou will not be charged the Budget amount upfront or automatically - your Budget is not a subscription.\nRather, you will be charged Fees (as further described below) and the types of Fees covered by a Budget will not exceed your specified Budget without your permission.\nWhile Thumbtack may provide an estimate for the number of Consumers who may contact you if you set a particular Budget for a particular Budget Period, or if you otherwise set a certain spending preference, you acknowledge and agree that any such estimate is not a guarantee, that Thumbtack does not and cannot control any Consumer or other individual\u2019s interest in contacting or hiring you, and that actual results will vary.\n</p>\n<p> We will identify the length of the Budget Period when you set your Budget.\nThe length of the Budget Period will not change within a given Budget Period but may be changed for subsequent Budget Periods.\nIf a Budget Period length changes, you can adjust your Budget.\nIf you do not do so, Thumbtack will automatically pro-rate your then-current Budget to the length of the new period.\nFor example, if you indicate you are willing to spend $100 for a one-week Budget Period, the Budget Period shifts to two weeks, and you do not make changes manually, your Budget will automatically be adjusted to $200 for the two-week Budget Period.\nYou can change your Budget for a Budget Period at any time, including in the middle of a Budget Period, subject to the terms of this paragraph and what you have already spent.\nIf you do not change your Budget in advance of a subsequent Budget Period, your Budget from the then-current Budget Period will automatically be used for that subsequent Budget Period, subject to the foregoing.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Timing of Charges for Service Professionals on Thumbtack</em>.\nAs a Service Professional using Thumbtack, there are different points at which your payment method may be charged: </p>\n<p>If You Lack Sufficient Purchasing History on Thumbtack</p>\n<p> If you are new to Thumbtack or do not have a sufficient purchasing history on the Platform as determined in Thumbtack\u2019s sole and absolute discretion, your payment method may be charged each time you are contacted or booked by a Consumer or other individual and you do not have an adequate Thumbtack balance to cover the cost of that contact.\n</p>\n<p>If You Have a Sufficient Purchasing History On Thumbtack</p>\n<p> Once Thumbtack determines, in our sole and absolute discretion, that you have sufficient purchasing history on Thumbtack, Thumbtack may charge your payment method periodically for the total Fees accrued when Consumers or other individuals contact you.\nSpecifically, Thumbtack may charge your payment method each time (a) a specific time period has passed.\nand/or (b) within that time period, each time the total Fees accrued hit a certain dollar threshold.\nThe frequency of charges may not match the Budget Period described above.\nThumbtack may adjust both the specific time period and the dollar threshold that trigger charges in our sole and absolute discretion.\nThumbtack may also, in our sole and absolute discretion, revert to charging your payment method each time you are contacted by a Consumer or other individual and you do not have an adequate Thumbtack balance to cover the cost of that contact.\n</p>\n<p> Thumbtack may offer certain services or features with payment timing that differs from, or is not applicable to, the above.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Default Payment Method</em>.\nFor ordinary charges from Service Professionals, Thumbtack will first attempt to charge the default payment method.\nIn the event that Thumbtack is unable to charge that payment method for any reason--including but not limited to exceeding a payment method\u2019s credit limit, payment method cancellation, a payment method being out of date, or payment method details being incorrect--you agree that Thumbtack may charge any other payment method associated with your account and take any other action to collect payment from you.\nIf your payment details change, your card provider may provide us with updated card details.\nWe may use these new details in order to help prevent any interruption to the Pro Services.\nIf Thumbtack is unable to charge the default payment method, Thumbtack may attempt to charge any other payment methods associated with your Account in any order.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Penalty Fees for All Users</em>.\nThumbtack may also charge penalty Fees for fraud, misconduct, late payment or other violations of these Terms, as determined in our sole discretion.\nInformation about current penalty Fees is available in the help center.\n</p>\n<p> In addition, Thumbtack may charge certain penalty Fees disclosed directly in the Platform, including cancellation Fees.\n</p>\n<p> You agree to pay all applicable Fees or charges based on the Fee and billing terms then in effect, regardless of whether you have an active Account.\nCharges will be made to the payment method designated at the time you accrue a Fee.\nIf you do not pay on time or if Thumbtack cannot charge a payment method for any reason, Thumbtack reserves all rights permissible under law to recover payment plus all costs and expenses incurred, including reasonable attorneys' fees, in our pursuit of payment.\nIf any Fee is not paid in a timely manner, or we are unable to process your transaction using the payment method provided, we reserve the right to terminate or suspend your Account.\n</p>\n<p> You explicitly agree that all communication in relation to delinquent accounts or Fees due will be made by electronic mail or by phone.\nYou agree that all notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.\nYou agree that you have the ability to store such electronic communications such that they remain accessible to you in an unchanged form.\nYou agree to keep your contact information current, including but not limited to your email address and phone number.\nSuch communication may be made by Thumbtack or by anyone on our behalf, including but not limited to a third-party collection agent.\nIf you cancel your Account at any time, you will not receive any refund.\nIf you have a balance due on your Account, you agree that Thumbtack may charge such unpaid Fees to any payment method or otherwise bill you for such unpaid Fees.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Taxes</em>.\nPayments required by these Terms may be stated exclusive of all taxes, duties, levies, imposts, fines or similar governmental assessments, including sales and use taxes, value-added taxes, goods and services taxes, excise, business, service, and similar transactional taxes imposed by any jurisdiction and the interest and penalties thereon (collectively, \u201cTaxes\u201d).\nCertain jurisdictions, however, may require us to collect Taxes from you in connection with the purchase of, payment for, access to, facilitation of or use of the Pro Services, and you will be responsible for and bear Taxes associated with the purchase of, payment for, access to, or use of the Pro Services.\nCharges are inclusive of applicable Taxes where required by law.\nYou hereby confirm that Thumbtack can determine your appropriate jurisdiction for tax purposes however it deems appropriate or as required by law, and you agree to pay taxes to Thumbtack when Thumbtack includes a charge for taxes on any invoice.\nYou also understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining your own tax reporting and sales and use tax collection requirements in consultation with your own tax advisers, and that we cannot and do not offer specific tax advice to either Service Professionals or Consumers.\n</p> TRACKING COMMUNICATIONS <p> In order to ensure appropriate charging of Fees and compliance with these Terms, Thumbtack may track the occurrence of communications between Consumers and Service Professionals that occur off of the Platform via email, phone call, SMS text message, third-party websites, or any other means, whether initiated by a Consumer or Service Professional.\nIn order to track the occurrence of such communications, Thumbtack may obscure Service Professional contact information in a Service Professional profile, replace Service Professional contact information in a Service Professional profile with a different piece of contact information that will forward to the Service Professional, or take any other step reasonably calculated to track the occurrence of such communications.\nExcept as explicitly stated herein, we will not record or review the content of any communications that do not come into contact with the Thumbtack Platform unless we first obtain your permission.\n</p>\n<p> If you send text messages with a Consumer or Service Professional using the telephone number for that User available on the Platform, we may use a third-party service provider to track these text messages.\nWe track these text messages for fraud prevention, to ensure appropriate charging of Fees, to enforce these Terms, and for quality and training purposes.\nAs part of this process, Thumbtack and our service provider will receive in real time and store data about your text message, including the date and time of the text message, your phone number, and the content of the text message.\n</p> THUMBTACK PLUS <p> Thumbtack Plus is a subscription-based, online service available to certain Consumers.\nIf you subscribe to Thumbtack Plus and your account is fully-paid and in good standing, you are eligible to receive benefits outlined here, which may change at any time.\nAt the end of your Thumbtack Plus subscription, your subscription will automatically renew for periods of the same length as your original subscription unless you opt-out at least five business days prior to such automatic renewal by providing notice to Thumbtack by choosing \u201cturn off auto-renew\u201d option on your Thumbtack Plus membership page or by contacting Thumbtack customer service.\nThumbtack may choose to discontinue the Thumbtack Plus service at any time, in which case subscribers will be refunded a prorated amount of their subscription fee based on the portion of your subscription that has elapsed to that point.\nSubscribers may cancel their subscription at any time, but the subscription fee is nonrefundable.\nThumbtack Plus is available to consumer households only.\nBusinesses, property managers, landlords and other similar persons may not utilize Thumbtack Plus and any attempt to do so will disqualify them from the Thumbtack Plus benefits.\nThumbtack Plus subscriptions are subject to these Terms and any information you share in connection therewith is subject to the Privacy Policy.\nYou understand that if you violate the Terms, Thumbtack may terminate your Thumbtack Plus subscription without any refund of your Thumbtack Plus subscription fee or otherwise.\n</p> MARKETPLACE PAYMENTS <p> The Thumbtack platform may facilitate payments between Consumers and Service Professionals (\u201cMarketplace Payments\u201d) through our payment processing partner Stripe, but Thumbtack is not a party to any such Marketplace Payments or any Pro Services related thereto.\nUnless otherwise indicated, Marketplace Payments may be made for services only.\nMarketplace Payments for tangible personal property is prohibited.\nBy agreeing to these terms or continuing to operate as a Service Professional on the Platform, you hereby appoint Thumbtack to act as your agent for the limited purpose of facilitating and receiving Marketplace Payments on your behalf through Stripe as contemplated herein.\nYou acknowledge and agree that, subject to any rights you have pertaining to Marketplace Payment disputes, once a Marketplace Payment has been made through the Thumbtack Platform, the payment obligation of the payor User shall be deemed satisfied by the payee User upon receipt of the Marketplace Payment by Thumbtack as though the payor User had made the Marketplace Payment directly to the payee User.\n</p>\n<p> Thumbtack does not offer any professional services directly or indirectly unless specified in a separate contract to which Thumbtack is a direct party.\nAny time a Consumer pays for or books Pro Services on the Platform or receives a quote in connection with Pro Services, such Consumer is contracting directly with the Service Professional offering such Pro Service.\n<strong>Notwithstanding any facilitation of booking or payment, you understand and agree that Thumbtack (i) does not sell, offer, provide or subcontract any Pro Service and (ii) is not liable in any way for any Pro Service, except to the extent expressly set forth in the Thumbtack Guarantee (which guarantee is provided in connection with Thumbtack\u2019s role as a marketplace only, not in a role of provider of Pro Services).\n</strong> Notwithstanding Thumbtack\u2019s role as a payment facilitator, each Service Professional who receives Marketplace Payments understands and agrees that they are obligated to perform the Pro Service as outlined in their agreement with the Consumer and work to remedy any material deviations from such contract.\n</p>\n<p> Service Professionals who receive Marketplace Payments from Consumers on Thumbtack must agree to the Stripe Connected Account Agreement, which includes the Stripe Services Agreement.\nService Professionals should never agree to receive a Marketplace Payment, or perform services in expectation thereof, before they have confirmed that they can comply with such Stripe agreements and, in particular, Service Professionals should note that they will need a social security number or employer identification number in order to receive Marketplace Payments.\nAs a Service Professional, by agreeing to these terms or continuing to operate as a Service Professional on Thumbtack, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Connected Account Agreement and Stripe Services Agreement, as those agreements may be modified by Stripe from time to time.\nAs a condition of receiving payment processing services through Stripe, you agree to provide Thumbtack with accurate and complete information about you and your business, and you authorize Thumbtack to share this information and transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by Stripe.\nService Professionals also agree that Thumbtack may debit their Stripe account in connection with disputes with Consumers.\nThumbtack reserves the right to process such debits and to withhold final payments until Thumbtack has investigated disputes.\nThumbtack may make a final decision on disputes in their sole discretion and, as a Service Professional, you understand that all Marketplace Payments you may earn on the Platform are subject to such decisions.\nAdditionally, Service Professionals agree that Thumbtack may reverse payments that have been made to a Service Professional\u2019s Stripe Connected Account when a customer refund or guarantee payout is warranted, including in connection with such Service Professional\u2019s actions or inactions that are prohibited by these Terms.\n</p>\n<p> As a Consumer making a Marketplace Payment through Stripe, you agree to pay all amounts you owe when due using your preferred payment method.\nYou further authorize Stripe to charge your preferred payment method for amounts you owe when they are due, whether they are recurring or one-time payments.\nYou must keep all payment information you provide us up-to-date, accurate and complete.\nWhen you store a payment method with us, you agree to our Stored Payment Terms and Conditions.\nDo not share your payment card, bank account or other financial information with any other User.\nWe take steps to secure all payment methods and other personal financial information, but we expressly disclaim any liability to you, and you agree to hold us harmless for any damages you may suffer as a result of the disclosure of your personal financial information to any unintended recipients.\n</p>\n<p> Thumbtack may enable you to make Marketplace Payments using credit, debit, or prepaid cards, by linking your bank account, or by any other payment method we support.\nWe reserve the right to cancel your ability to make payments with one or more of the payment methods you have authorized in our sole and absolute discretion.\n</p>\n<p> If you choose your bank account as your Marketplace Payment method, you authorize Stripe to make Automated Clearing House (\u201cACH\u201d) withdrawals from your bank account, and to make any inquiries we consider necessary to validate any dispute involving payments you make to us or to a User, which may include ordering a credit report and performing other credit checks or verifying the information you provide us against third-party databases.\nYou authorize Thumbtack or our provider to initiate one or more ACH debit entries (withdrawals) or the creation of an equivalent bank draft for the specified amount(s) from your bank account, and you authorize the financial institution that holds your bank account to deduct such payments.\nYou also authorize the bank that holds your bank account to deduct any such payments in the amounts and frequency designated in your Account.\nYour authorization will remain in effect until canceled in writing by you.\nYou agree to notify us of any changes to your account information or termination of your authorization at least five days prior to your next payment.\n</p>\n<p> If your full payment is not processed by us at the same time, you hereby authorize partial debits from your bank account, not to exceed the total amount of your order.\nYou agree to pay any ACH fees or fines you or we incur associated with transactions you authorize.\nThis return fee will vary based on which state you are located in.\nThe return fee may be added to your payment amount and debited from your bank account if we resubmit an ACH debit due to insufficient funds.\nWe may initiate a collection process or legal action to collect any money owed to us.\nYou agree to pay all our costs for such action, including any reasonable attorneys' fees.\nFederal law limits your liability for any fraudulent, erroneous, or unauthorized transactions from your bank account based on how quickly you report it to your financial institution.\nYou must report any fraudulent, erroneous or unauthorized transactions to your bank no more than 60 days after the disputed transaction appeared on your bank account statement.\nPlease contact your bank for more information about the policies and procedures that apply unauthorized transactions and the limits on your liability.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Marketplace Payment Disputes</em>: All requests for Marketplace Payment chargebacks, errors, claims, refunds and disputes (\u201cPayment Disputes\u201d) will be subject to review by Thumbtack in accordance with the rules applicable to the payment method you used to make the Marketplace Payment and will be in Thumbtack\u2019s absolute discretion.\nThumbtack is not liable to you under any circumstances for Payment Disputes we are unable to resolve in your favor.\nWe will normally process a valid written Payment Dispute request within 30 days after we receive it, unless a shorter period is required by law.\nYou may file a Payment Dispute by emailing it to Thumbtack support at support@thumbtack.com.\nIf you close or deactivate your Account before we adjudicate your Payment Dispute, we will not be able to issue you any amounts you are owed.\nWe will attempt to pay you any Payment Disputed amounts you are owed using the method with which you made the disputed payment, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so if your payment method information is inaccurate, incomplete, or has been canceled.\n</p>\n<p> If your actions result in, or are likely to result in, a Payment Dispute, a violation of these Terms of Use or the creation of other risks to Thumbtack or our payment processing partners, or if we determine that your Account has been used to engage in deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, then we may permanently withhold any amounts owed to you in our sole discretion.\nIf you have a past due balance due on any Account, or for any additional amounts that we determine you owe us, we may, without limiting any other rights or remedies: (a) charge one or more of your payment methods.\n(b) offset any amounts you owe us against amounts you may be owed.\n(c) invoice you for amounts due to us, which such amounts will be due upon receipt.\n(d) reverse or block any credits to your bank account.\nor (e) collect payment from you by any other lawful means.\n</p>\n<p> If you fail to make Marketplace Payments you owe when due, or if Thumbtack is unable to charge one of your payment methods for any reason, Thumbtack reserves all rights permissible under law to recover payment and all costs and expenses incurred, including reasonable attorneys' fees and related costs, in our pursuit of payment.\nYou explicitly agree that all communication in relation to delinquent accounts or overdue payments will be made by electronic mail or by phone.\nSuch communication may be made by Thumbtack or by anyone on our behalf, including but not limited to a third-party collections agent.\n</p>\n<p> Thumbtack may, from time to time, place a hold on any of your payment methods in order to prevent failed payments or in order to reverse your booking.\n</p> THUMBTACK PROMOTIONS <p> You may receive certain offers from Thumbtack (\u201cPromotions\u201d), including but not limited to discounted or free use of the Platform for a limited period, discounts on or credits towards payments made for Pro Services, and discounts or credits in relation to referrals.\nAny Promotions are offered at Thumbtack\u2019s discretion, and may be revoked at any time and for any reason.\nNote that any attempt (as determined by Thumbtack in its sole discretion) to game, fraud, or in any way circumvent terms of a promotion is grounds for revocation, including but not limited to providing false information or utilizing multiple User accounts.\n</p>\n<p> You are only eligible for any benefits described in the Promotion if (a) you received a communication directly from Thumbtack offering you that Promotion, (b) you satisfy all the requirements identified in that communication.\nand (c) you maintain an account in good standing with Thumbtack.\nWe may condition receipt of a benefit described in a Promotion in any manner we see appropriate, including limiting eligibility to a subset of Users, to specific categories, or to certain dates.\nTo be eligible for a benefit described in a Promotion, you may need to take a specific action (including but not limited to signing up for a service) or make a payment for specific services.\nExcept where otherwise noted, Promotions are for one-time use only and cannot be stacked (i.e.\na User may only use one Promotion per project).\n</p>\n<p> Any benefits from participating in the Promotion, requirements of accepting the offer, and any other conditions to receive any benefit described in the Promotion will be disclosed to you.\nAfter a Promotion ends, regardless of whether you have already satisfied the requirements, you will be ineligible to receive those benefits.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary, Thumbtack may revoke a benefit if we believe that you have not satisfied the Promotion requirements, including maintaining an Account in good standing.\n</p> SPONSORED INFORMATION <p> Thumbtack may publicly display advertisements, paid content, and other sponsored information.\nThe manner, mode, and extent of such advertising are subject to change without specific notice to you.\nService Professionals may compensate Thumbtack to highlight themselves in search results and therefore rank higher.\nAny such Service Professionals will be clearly designated in applicable search results.\nThumbtack may impose certain quality-related standards for Service Professionals to qualify as for a search rankings boost, which standards may be enforced and/or changed at any time.\n</p> DISPUTES BETWEEN OR AMONG USERS <p> Thumbtack values our Service Professionals and Consumers, and we understand that occasionally disputes may arise between or among them.\nOur goal is to provide tools to help Users resolve such disputes independently.\nIn the rare event a dispute regarding an interaction related to the Platform cannot be resolved independently, you agree, at Thumbtack's request, to participate in good faith, to the extent you are reasonably able to do so, in a neutral resolution or mediation conducted by Thumbtack or a neutral third-party mediator or arbitrator selected by Thumbtack.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that Thumbtack is under no obligation to become involved in or impose resolution in any dispute between or among Users or any third-party.\n</p> INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS <p> Thumbtack Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, and other laws of the United States,

intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between you and Thumbtack, including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and Thumbtack, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory.\nclaims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to advertising).\nand claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\nThe only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided below.\n</p>\n<p> By agreeing to these Terms, you agree to resolve any and all disputes with Thumbtack as follows: </p>\n<p>\n<em>Initial Dispute Resolution</em>: Most disputes can be resolved without resort to litigation.\nYou can reach Thumbtack's support department at support@thumbtack.com.\nExcept for intellectual property and small claims court claims, the parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with the Thumbtack support department, and good faith negotiations will be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Binding Arbitration</em>: If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below.\nSpecifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or previous versions of these Terms (including the Terms' or Privacy Policy's formation, performance, and breach), the parties' relationship with each other, and/or your use of the Platform will be finally settled by binding arbitration, as described below.\n</p>\n<p> Where the relief sought by you is $10,000.99 or less and you do not wish to bring the claim in small claims court, the arbitration will be conducted online by an online arbitration provider of our choosing in accordance with their applicable arbitration rules &amp.\nprocedures effective at the time a claim is made.\nCurrently, you may initiate arbitration proceedings on the FairClaims website.\nYou are responsible for your own attorneys' fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.\n</p>\n<p> Where the relief sought is $10,001.00 or more, resolution will be in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules for claims that do not exceed $250,000.00 and the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims exceeding $250,000.00 in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.\nTo initiate an arbitration with JAMS, you must do the following: (a) write a Demand for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the amount of damages you seek to recover (you may find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com).\n(b) send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco, California 94111.\nand (c) send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to Thumbtack at 415 Natoma Street, Suite 1300, San Francisco, California 94103, ATTN: Legal.\nYou will be required to pay $250 to initiate an arbitration against us.\nIf the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Thumbtack will pay all other fees invoiced by JAMS, including filing fees and arbitrator and hearing expenses.\nYou are responsible for your own attorneys' fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.\n</p>\n<p> The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms or the Privacy Policy, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms or Privacy Policy is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct.\nThe arbitrator will be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.\nThe arbitrator's award will be written and will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p> The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.\nThey further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.\n</p>\n<p> If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing.\nFor individuals residing outside the United States, arbitration will be initiated in the state of California, United States.\nYou and Thumbtack further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in San Francisco County, California in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Class Action Waiver</em> The parties further agree that the arbitration will be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.\nYOU AND THUMBTACK AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nIf any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above will be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties will be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Exception: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims</em>: Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court or in the U.S.\nPatent and Trademark Office to protect your or our intellectual property rights (\"intellectual property rights\" means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, trade dress, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights).\nEither party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>30-Day Right to Opt Out</em>: You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending (from the email address you use on Thumbtack) written notice of your decision to opt out to opt-out@thumbtack.com with the subject line, \"ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT.\" The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of the later of the Effective Date of these Terms or your first use of the Platform.\notherwise, you will be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs.\nIf you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Thumbtack also will not be bound by them.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Changes to This Section</em>: Thumbtack will provide thirty (30) days' notice of any changes affecting the substance of this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section by posting on the Thumbtack Terms of Use website, sending you a message, or otherwise notifying you when you are logged into your account.\nAmendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on the Thumbtack Terms of Use website or sent to you.\n</p>\n<p> Changes to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the 30th day.\nIf a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on \"Changes to This Section\" is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection will be severed from the section entitled \u201cArbitration and Class Action Waiver,\u201d and the court or arbitrator will apply the first Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began using the Platform.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Survival</em>: This Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section will survive any termination of your Account or the Platform.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Third-Party Beneficiary</em>: You and Thumbtack acknowledge that any third-party consumer reporting agency that Thumbtack uses to perform background checks on Service Professionals is an express and intended third-party beneficiary of this arbitration provision and as such, the terms of this Arbitration provision will inure to the benefit of the consumer reporting agencies and may be enforced by them.\nAccordingly, you agree that any dispute that arises between you and a consumer reporting agency that relates to or arises out of this Agreement or any aspect of your relationship with Thumbtack will be resolved by binding arbitration.\nIf any court or arbitrator determines that this third-party beneficiary subsection is void or unenforceable for any reason, then this subsection will be severed from the section entitled \u201cArbitration and Class Action Waiver,\u201d and the remainder of the section will remain enforceable, meaning that the class action waiver and the mutual obligation to resolve disputes between you and Thumbtack through binding arbitration remains enforceable.\n</p> GOVERNING LAW <p> The Terms and the relationship between you and Thumbtack will be governed in all respects by the laws of the state of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.\nYou agree that any claim or dispute you may have against Thumbtack that is not subject to arbitration must be resolved by a court located in San Francisco County, California, or a United States District Court, Northern District of California, located in San Francisco, California, except as otherwise agreed by the parties.\nYou agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco County, California or the United States District Court, Northern District of California located in San Francisco, California, for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes that are not subject to arbitration.\nYou hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.\n</p> DISCLAIMERS <p> YOUR USE OF THE PLATFORM, PRO SERVICES, OR COLLECTIVE CONTENT IS SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE
