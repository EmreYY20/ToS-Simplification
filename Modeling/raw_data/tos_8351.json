and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) arising from or in any way related to any claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account)and any Products, and (b) your violation of these Terms.\nIn the event of such a claim, suit, or action (\u201cClaim\u201d), we will attempt to provide notice of the

hereunder).</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Assignment.\n</em>\n</strong>You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account,

authority to operate the Product, and may subject You to an FCC inquiry and possible enforcement action.\n</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Availability: </em>\n</strong>You have agreed to join Telly\u2019s waitlist for the Product when it becomes available.\nJoining Telly\u2019s waitlist does not guarantee that You will receive a Product, for which quantities may be limited.\nTelly reserves the right to modify the queue for the Product as deemed appropriate in its sole discretion.\n</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Valid Credit Card Required: </em>\n</strong>You will need to

records.\n</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.\n</em>\n</strong>Please read the following ARBITRATION AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Telly and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Telly.\nBoth you and Telly acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, Telly's officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (\u201cPersonnel\u201d) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>\n<p>(a) Arbitration Rules.\nApplicability of Arbitration Agreement.\nThe parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration.\nIf such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, then, notwithstanding section (c), \u201cSmall Claims Court.\nInfringement,\u201d ALL DISPUTES WITH TELLY ARISING IN ANY WAY FROM THESE TERMS SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, AND NOT BE A COURT OR JURY..\nThe arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the \u201cRules\u201d) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes.\nThe arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules.\nJudgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p>(b) Costs of Arbitration.\nThe Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.\nTelly will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars.\nTelly will not seek its attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.\n</p>\n<p>(c) Small Claims Court.\nInfringement.\nEither you or Telly may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in Los Angeles, California or any United States county where you live or work.\nFurthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.\n</p>\n<p>(d) Waiver of Jury Trial.\nYOU AND TELLY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY.\nYou and Telly are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration.\nArbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.\nIn any litigation between you and Telly over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND TELLY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>\n<p>(e) <em>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.\n</em>ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS.\nCLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.\nIf however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Telly is entitled to arbitration.\ninstead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.\n</p>\n<p>(f) <em>Opt-out.\n</em>You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: support@freetelly.com within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms.\nYou must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms\u2019 arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>(g) <em>Exclusive Venue</em>.\nIf you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Telly to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and Telly agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, Los Angeles, California, or the federal district in which that county falls.\n</p>\n<p>(h)<em> Severability.</em> If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration Agreement section will be null and void.\nThis arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Telly.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Miscellaneous.</em>\n</strong> You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that the Telly may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit.\nThe failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.\nIf any provision of these Terms are found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.\nYou and Telly agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Telly, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms.\nYou hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Telly, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Telly in any respect whatsoever.\n</p>\n<p>Except as expressly set forth in the sections above regarding the Apple Application and the arbitration agreement, you and Telly agree there are no third-party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.</p>Partner With UsAdvertise With UsContact Us\u00a9 2023 Telly Corp.\nAll rights
