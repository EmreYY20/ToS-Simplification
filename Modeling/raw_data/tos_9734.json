has been working with K-12 schools and school districts since 1998 and has always maintained clear terms regarding how we treat student and staff data.\nWe reinforce our commitment through participation in a pledge created by the Future of Privacy Forum (FPF) and the Software &amp.\nInformation Industry Association (SIIA) to advance data privacy protection regarding the collection, maintenance, and use of personal information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We will:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not sell student or staff information</li>\n<li>Not behaviorally target advertising nor show advertising to any user</li>\n<li>Use data for authorized education purposes only</li>\n<li>Enforce strict limits on data retention</li>\n<li>Support parental access to, and correction of errors in, their children\u2019s information</li>\n<li>Provide comprehensive security standards</li>\n<li>Be transparent about the collection and use of data<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Definition of Data<br>\n</strong>Data includes all personally identifiable information (PII) and other non-public information.\nData includes, but is not limited to, student data, staff data, metadata, and user content.\nSee Data Collection section for specific data types.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Scope of Policy<br>\n</strong>This Policy describes the types of information we may collect, or that you may provide, when registering with, accessing, or using Gaggle solutions.\nThis Policy does not apply to information we collect offline or on Gaggle websites (such as our company website) or to information that you may provide to, or is collected by, third parties.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Purpose of Data Collection and Ownership<br>\n</strong>We consider all school and district data to be confidential and do not use such data for any purpose other than to provide services on your behalf and as outlined in your service level agreement or contract.\nStudent data is the property of the school or district and remains in the school or district\u2019s control throughout the duration of any agreement/contract.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Role of School and School Officials<br>\n</strong>Although this Policy will focus mainly on what we do, and what we confirm we will not do, with student and staff data, we believe that schools and school officials are critical partners in our collective efforts to protect and ensure only appropriate use of student-related information entrusted to them and us.\nIn that regard, schools and school officials using Gaggle solutions should be mindful that in granting or allowing access to Gaggle solutions, they are controlling who has access to student and staff information.\nWhen we reference \u201cgranting or allowing access,\u201d we are referring to both intentional actions, such as an administrator authorizing a Gaggle account for a teacher, as well as unintentional actions and consequences that may flow from, for example, a school\u2019s failure to maintain sufficient data governance or security practices.</p>\n<p>In cases where the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) applies, access to certain student information remains the legal responsibility of the applicable school.\nIn all situations, it is incumbent upon our customers to make an affirmative determination before furnishing access to anyone that the party has a legitimate need for access to Gaggle solutions and the sensitive information that may be accessible to that party through Gaggle solutions.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information About Students<br>\n</strong>\n<i>FERPA and Education Records</i>\n</p>\n<p>Although FERPA was enacted decades ago, and certainly well before internet-based services became ubiquitous in academic settings, one of its core tenets was and remains the protection of the privacy of PII in students\u2019 education records.\nAs defined in FERPA, \u201ceducation records\u201d are \u201cthose records, files, documents, and other materials which (i) contain information directly related to a student.\nand (ii) are maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a person acting for such agency or institution.\u201d PII from education records includes information such as a student\u2019s name or identification number, which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual\u2019s identity, either directly or indirectly through linkages with other information.</p>\n<p>FERPA requires that educational institutions and agencies that receive certain federal funds (for example, public schools) get prior consent from a parent or legal guardian before disclosing any education records regarding that student to a third party.\nConsequently, before you enter, upload, or access any data concerning a minor student, you must confirm that your agency or institution has (1) obtained appropriate consent from the parent or guardian of that student or (2) determined that one of the limited exceptions to the consent requirement applies.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Gaggle only uses PII from students\u2019 education records to enable the use of Gaggle solutions to promote school safety and the physical security of students</strong>.\nUnless a school official expressly instructs otherwise, we will not share or reuse PII from education records for any other purpose.\nWhile we think those statements are clear, <strong>to avoid any doubt, we will not use student PII to target students or their families for advertising or marketing efforts or sell rosters of student PII to third parties.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>FERPA (\u00a7 99.31(a)(1)(i)(B)) permits schools to outsource institutional services or functions that involve the disclosure of education records to contractors, consultants, volunteers, or other third parties provided that the outside party: Performs an institutional service or function for which the agency or institution would otherwise use employees.\nIs under the direct control of the agency or institution with respect to the use and maintenance of education records.\nIs subject to the requirements in \u00a7 99.33(a) that the personally identifiable information (PII) from education records may be used only for the purposes for which the disclosure was made, e.g., to promote school safety and the physical security of students, and governing the redisclosure of PII from education records.\nand Meets the criteria specified in the school or local educational agency\u2019s (LEA\u2019s) annual notification of FERPA rights for being a school official with a legitimate educational interest in the education records.</p>\n<p>\n<i>COPPA and Children Under the Age of 13</i>\n</p>\n<p>The Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) is a federal law designed to protect the privacy of children under 13 years old.</p>\n<p>Gaggle\u2019s services are in compliance with the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.\nGaggle Services participates in the iKeepSafe Safe Harbor program.\nIf you have any questions or need to file a complaint related to our privacy policy and practices, please do not hesitate to contact the iKeepSafe Safe Harbor program at COPPAprivacy@ikeepsafe.org</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Individual children are not allowed to sign up for any Gaggle solutions.\n<strong>The only way a child may obtain access to a Gaggle solution is through their school.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Each school is responsible for creating student accounts for any Gaggle solution.\nFor example, schools may choose to list students\u2019 full names, grade level, and ID number in the record for each user.\nEntering data in these fields is optional and is intended for administrative purposes only.</li>\n<li>The schoolwide data collected by Gaggle is the school\u2019s address, grade levels, and other aggregate information about the school\u2019s internet connection, computers, and the likelihood of students having devices such as smartphones or tablets.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>Disclosure and Retention of PII<br>\n</strong>Gaggle will not distribute to third parties any staff data or student data without the consent of either a parent/guardian or a qualified educational institution except in cases of <strong>Possible Student Situations (PSS),</strong> which may be reported to law enforcement.</p>\n<p>To protect your students, the school or the district against the risks involved in handling sexually explicit content involving minors, <strong>Gaggle registers incidents containing explicit videos and images of possible minors with the CyberTipline at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).</strong> It is NCMEC\u2019s mission to prevent the spread of these materials, as well as to prevent the sexual exploitation of children.</p>\n<p>We may also disclose student or staff data to comply with a court order, law, or legal process (including a government or regulatory request), but before doing so, we will provide the applicable school with notice of the requirement so that, if the school so chooses, it could seek a protective order or another remedy.\nIf after providing that notice we remain obligated to disclose the demanded student or staff data, we will disclose no more than that portion of data which, on the advice of our legal counsel, the order, law, or process specifically requires us to disclose.</p>\n<p>If a third party purchases all or most of our ownership interests or assets, or we merge with another organization, it is possible that we would need to disclose data to the other organization following the transaction.\nfor example, were we to integrate Gaggle with the other organization\u2019s product offerings.\nTo the extent any such transaction would alter our practices relative to this Policy, we will give schools or school districts notice of those changes and any choices they may have regarding student or staff data.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a merger, acquisition, or substantial transfer of assets, we will provide you with notice within thirty (30) days following the completion of such a transaction, by posting on our homepage and by email to your email address that you provided to us.\nIf you do not consent to the use of your information by such a successor company, subject to applicable law, you may request its deletion from the company.</p>\n<p>Finally, although we outlined earlier in this Policy what constitutes student or staff data, we also want to be clear about what information is not student or staff data or PII.\nOnce PII, whether relating to a school or district employee or student, has been de-identified, that information is no longer PII.\nPII may be de-identified through aggregation or various other means.\nThe U.S.\nDepartment of Education has issued guidance on de-identifying PII in education records.\nIn order to allow us to proactively address customer needs, we anticipate using de-identified information to improve Gaggle solutions and services.\nThat said, we would use reasonable de-identification approaches to ensure that, in doing so, we are not compromising the privacy or security of the PII you entrust to us.\n<strong>We will not attempt to re-identify de-identified data and will not transfer de-identified data to any party unless that party agrees not to attempt re-identification.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Security and Protection of Data, Including PII<br>\n</strong>We have implemented measures designed to secure PII from accidental loss and unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.\nAmong other things, PII is encrypted in transit to and from Gaggle using SSL technology.\nIn addition, all PII is stored in multiple databases with extensive redundancy and failover maintained at data centers located in two geographically dispersed states, consistent with guidance from the U.S.\nDepartment of Education that storing sensitive education records within the United States is a \u201cbest practice.\u201d That said, unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure and, although we do our best to protect PII, neither we nor any other hosted service provider can guarantee the security of all personally identifiable information.</p>\n<p>Data integrity and accuracy are achieved through strict restrictions on how data may be accessed and by whom.\nAudit logs are kept to be able to track data modification.\nAdditional security measures are in place to prevent and identify data tampering.\nIn the extremely rare case of a data breach, we will immediately notify all customers affected using the primary email address specified in their accounts.\nIt is the responsibility of our customers to contact parents or legal guardians regarding a data breach.</p>\n<p>Gaggle has completed a SOC 2 Type 2 audit of the Trust Service Principles: Security, Availability, and Privacy.\nOur assessors\u2019 review of our technology and practices resulted in a final SOC 2 report free of any disclosures, which evidences Gaggle\u2019s unwavering commitment to information security and keeping our customers\u2019 data safe.</p>\n<p>According to the American Institute of CPAs:</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<em>\u201cA Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) or Cloud Service Organization that offers virtualized computing environments or services for user entities and wishes to assure its customers that the service organization maintains the confidentiality of its customers\u2019 information in a secure manner and that the information will be available when it is needed.\nA SOC 2 report addressing security, availability, and confidentiality provides user entities with a description of the service organization\u2019s system and the controls that help achieve those objectives.\u201d</em>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Expiration of Agreement and Disposal of Data, Including PII<br>\n</strong>Upon the expiration or termination of any agreement/contract between a school or school district and Gaggle, we keep customer data for up to 30 days except in cases where state laws require a specific shorter or longer duration.</p>\n<p>Any retained data will, of course, remain subject to the restrictions on disclosure and use outlined in this policy for as long as it resides with us.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Correction of Data<br>\n</strong>We only accept requests to change data from main contacts and administrators.\nParents or legal guardians who request changes
