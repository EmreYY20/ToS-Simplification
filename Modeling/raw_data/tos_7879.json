major USERS can pass orders on the SITE.<br>\n<br> Prices given are with an immediate payment obligation and cannot be refunded.\nThe USER acknowledges and accepts that they have no right of retraction when the activation key has been sent, or when the download link has been communicated.\n<br>\n<br> Prices are paid online through the operator (Paypal or Payzen) (hereinafter the OPERATOR).\nUntil the OPERATOR informs both the USER and VB AUDIO that payment has been made the price cannot be considered to have been paid.\nIn the event of a dispute relating to payment, the OPERATOR's information system shall have probative force between the parties.<br>\n<br> If payment is accepted by the operator, but subsequently rejected (in particular due to an objection or fraudulent use of a means of payment), VB AUDIO may terminate or suspend the granted licence without any legal formality or notice and without prejudice for its right to go to law.\n<br>\n<br> The

confirmation of it by the OPERATOR.<br>\n<br> The USER acknowledges and accepts that when the APPLICATION is provided with an activation key the granted licence authorises one (1) single reproduction of the application on one (1) single machine, and that the activation keys are for a single use, i.e.\nare intended to be used with one (1) single installed application.\n<br>\n<br> When the APPLICATION is protected by an activation key the USER acknowledges and accepts that the licence is granted for one installation on one (1) machine with inherent technical characteristics.\nThe USER acknowledges and accepts that the activation key will not operate on another machine.\n<br>\n<br> A USER who wishes to obtain a new key due to a change of machine can obtain it via the \"webshop\" interface on page \"My Licenses\" of its USER account.\nThe USER acknowledges and accepts that this operation can be made only one single time, and that subsequently it must purchase a new licence if it wishes to install and use the APPLICATION on another machine.<br>\n</p>3.4 Terms applicable to distributor licences:<p>\n<br> For each ordered distributor licence VB AUDIO grants a non-exclusive, non-assignable right, for the whole world, to:</p>\n<p>(i) put up for sale, promote, distribute or resell a licence for the APPLICATION to end users, up to a maximum of the number of distributor licences purchased at the time of the order (one (1) distributor licence enables one (1) licence to be sold to one end user);<br>\n<br> (ii) grant a sub-licence for use of the APPLICATIONS to end users, up to a maximum of the number of distributor licences purchased at the time of the order, in the form of a combined product, possibly incorporated in a specific package, provided that the sub-licence is not incompatible with the terms of the present contract.\nThe term \"combined product\" is understood to mean a single set, which is integrated and interoperable, consisting of the APPLICATION and of a third-party item of hardware or software;</p>\n<p>\n<br> Licences to end users are granted by the holder of the distributor licence for the whole world, and having effect for all time over which intellectual property over the APPLICATION shall last, pursuant to the legislations, both French and non-French, and international agreements, including any extensions which may be made to this term by the national and international legislations.&nbsp;The right of correction must be reserved for the benefit of VB AUDIO by the DISTRIBUTOR.<br>\n<br> The DISTRIBUTOR acknowledges and accepts that the APPLICATION can be provided with an activation key authorising one (1) single reproduction of the application on one (1) single machine and that the activation keys are for single usage, i.e.\nintended to be used with one (1) single installed application.\nWhen the APPLICATION is protected by an activation key the licence is granted for one installation on one (1) machine with inherent technical characteristics.\nThe activation key will not operate on another machine.\nThe DISTRIBUTOR must inform the end user thereof.<br>\n<br> The right of correction pursuant to the provisions of article L.\n122-6-1 of the Intellectual Property Code is reserved by VB AUDIO for all the applications.\nAll other rights not expressly stipulated by this article are reserved.<br>\n<br> All the APPLICATIONS are delivered or made available electronically, and only as an executable or object code version.<br>\n<br> VB AUDIO does not guarantee any quantitative or qualitative result or any performance, other than those indicated in the user documentation.\n<br>\n<br> The APPLICATIONS are provided without any other guarantee of any kind whatsoever.\nIn particular, VB AUDIO does not guarantee that the APPLICATION contains no errors (e.g.\nbugs) or operating anomalies.<br>\n<br> VB AUDIO does not guarantee that the APPLICATION is compatible or interoperable with software or hardware other than those stated in the required configuration.\nVB AUDIO does not guarantee upward compatibility with new versions of the software and hardware stated in the required configuration.\n<br>\n<br> The DISTRIBUTOR shall bear alone risks relating to the sale of the applications, and in particular interfaces, integrates, offers for sale, promotes or grants sub-licences over the APPLICATION under its own liability.\nVB AUDIO may under no circumstances be held liable for direct or indirect damage relating to marketing of the APPLICATION, including operating losses or financial losses.\nHowever, should VB AUDIO be held liable by an enforceable and final judgment, this judgement shall be capped at the price of the distributor licence.\nIn any event, VB AUDIO's liability shall lapse three (3) months after the generating event enabling it to be held liable.<br>\n</p>3.5 Promotion and additional user rights:<p>\n<br> VB audio is the holder of all intellectual
