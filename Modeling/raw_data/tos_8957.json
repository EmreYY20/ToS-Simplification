conflict of laws principles.\nEach party hereby expressly and irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California in connection with any action to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, to recover damages or other relief under this Agreement, or otherwise arising under or by reason of this Agreement.</p>

you agree to first contact us at legal@turnitin.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.\nIn the unlikely event that Turnitin has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, \u201cClaims\u201d), by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in

arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.\nand (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process.\nAny judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nNothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Turnitin from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.</p> Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.\n<p>WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE

of Turnitin</p>\n<p>The Privacy Policy below covers the kind of personal data we collect (and how), what we do with it, and how we protect any personal data you provide.\nProtecting your personal data is our top priority.\nWe are fully committed to transparency and using technology responsibly, no matter what changes emerge from our rapidly evolving digital world.\nAs we strive to create new possibilities in education, we hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards.\nWe strive to adhere to the strictest privacy practices so that your trust is well-deserved.\nand\nBecause your peace of mind is important to us, we guard your personal data with the utmost care.\nWe use it only for lawful reasons.</p> Privacy Policy <p>\n<strong>Last Updated: 12th October 2022</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all businesses and group companies of Turnitin.\nThis policy describes how Turnitin collects, uses, shares, and secures the personal data you provide.\nIt also describes your choices regarding use, access, and changes to your personal data.\nData collected through our service will be limited solely to the purpose of providing the service for which you (the Client) have engaged Turnitin.\nIf and when a third-party company provides a related service to support our service, such as language translation, we make sure that when personal data is processed by them, we require that those third-party companies meet our security standards and those of the applicable legislation that applies from time to time.\nWe refer to the collective sites run by Turnitin as the \u201cSite.\u201d</p> Why we collect personal data <p>When you create an account with us, or when a student has their work processed by Turnitin, we process personal data (such as name, email address, job title, and school) so that we can correctly administer your account and provide you with the best customer service.\nAll personal data we process is directly linked to a specific purpose, such as requesting access to our academic content database, sending grading data to your LMS or requesting web content (i.e.\na newsletter, case study, video, etc.).\nAt any time, you can access, update, rectify or erase any personal data by logging into your account and clicking \u201cUser Info\u201d (\u201cEdit Account\u201d on Gradescope) or contacting Customer Support.\nPlease see our Privacy Policy for more detailed information about how we protect your personally identifiable information.</p> Protecting your data <p>We endeavor to keep your personal data safe and secure at all times.\nDepending on the Turnitin solution used, personal data is processed either:</p>\n<p>1) both in Europe and in the United States, in the case of most products</p>\n<p>2) entirely within Europe, Canada, Australia, or the United States depending on the institution\u2019s preference, except for text recognition performed on handwritten formulas, which requires some data processing within the US, in the case of the Gradescope product</p>\n<p>In all of the cases above, we have robust technical and organizational safeguards in place to protect such personal data.\nPasswords are required to access your personal data, so please remember to keep your password confidential.\nEven with the best security systems, it is impossible to guarantee 100% protection from hackers and unauthorized third parties who capture information provided over public networks.</p>\n<p>When a paper is submitted to any of Turnitin\u2019s products with the exception of Gradescope, it is compared against a vast, secure proprietary database of licensed source material, including millions of periodicals, academic journals, books, and web pages.\nTurnitin also maintains a separate repository of student papers.\nEach institution (at the discretion of his or her school administrator) can determine whether or not to include student papers in the repository and whether or not to give students the option to opt out.\nWe can remove student papers from the standard repository at the request of a school administrator.</p>\n<p>When a teacher, professor, or other representative acting on behalf of a school or other institution uploads data to Gradescope, this may include personally identifiable information about students.\nWe may then collect an email address and password from these students, which is combined with student information received from the teacher and/or school.\nWe use the personal information we collect to operate, maintain, and provide the features and functionality of Gradescope, to analyze our offerings and functionality, and to communicate with our users: teachers, schools, students and website visitors.\nWe retain user data on the Gradescope service only as long as necessary to deliver our services.\nData associated with a given account is retained until the account owner or an institution, on behalf of the account owner, submits a deletion request.</p> What\u2019s most important 1.\nCompliance\n<p>Turnitin serves a global community of educators and students, whose views on data privacy may differ significantly.\nOur products and services, as well as our privacy policies, are regularly audited and inspected by both employees and external consultants to ensure that we meet, and exceed where possible, privacy expectations and requirements.\nTurnitin conducts periodic compliance reviews to verify that this Privacy Policy is accurate, comprehensive, prominently displayed, lawful, complete, implemented, and accessible.\nAny employee who violates this Privacy Policy will be subjected to disciplinary action.</p> Model Contract Clauses <p>Where necessary, for data transfers outside the EEA, we utilise the Model Contractual Clauses.\nIn each case, we put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal data.</p> Evolving Legislation <p>Due to the ever-changing nature of legislation around data privacy, we reserve the right to make lawful changes as needed and recommend that you periodically check this Privacy Policy to see if there have been any new developments or changes.\nWe continually look for ways to move toward more robust protection.</p> 2.\nPersonal data\n<p>Because we provide education services, we are vocal advocates for safeguarding student data and privacy and want to make sure that parents, educators, and schools know this, which is why we took the Student Privacy Pledge, put forth by the Future of Privacy Forum (FPF) and the Software &amp.\nInformation Industry Association (SIIA).</p> Data We Collect <p>When an institution\u2019s administrator or instructor creates an account with us, we ask for their personal data such as name, email, phone, and job title, so that we

any of your personal data.\nWe respond to requests within 30 calendar days.</p>\n</li>\n</ol> Exceptional Circumstances <p>We may disclose your personal data in order to comply with a subpoena, court

Essentials accredits a company\u2019s IT infrastructure ensuring that its firewalls, secure configurations, user access control, malware protection, and patch management are of a high enough standard to protect any data within the company.\nTurnitin obtained the Cyber Essentials certification at the request of several international customers.\nTurnitin successfully completed a third-party audit of the effectiveness of our basic security controls.</p> SOC 2 Compliance <p>SOC2 is an audit of a company\u2019s readiness to protect their user\u2019s privacy and the security of their data.\nThe company must show protections for both the data itself and the physical security of the locations it is stored.\nTurnitin obtained the SOC2 certification to demonstrate our commitment to security, privacy, and availability.\nTo obtain this certification, over 160 controls aligned to the SOC2 criteria were designed for Turnitin and audited for effectiveness.\nTurnitin successfully satisfied 100% of the controls audited.</p> 7.\nData Integrity\n<p>We take every possible step to make sure that the personal data in our systems is relevant for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.\nTurnitin will retain personal data we process on behalf of our clients for as long as needed to provide services to our client.\nWe retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.\nWe will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.\nYou may stop using the services at any time.\nYou do not need to specifically inform Turnitin when you stop using the Services.\nTo request account deletion, please submit such a request directly to your academic institution, and an administrator will then make this request to us on your behalf.\nAll requests from academic institutions must be made via email to tiisupport@turnitin.com for non-Gradescope accounts or help@gradescope.com for Gradescope accounts and are required to come from the email address registered to the administrator account.</p>\n<p>The Turnitin database includes academic papers submitted by students and educators, as well as licensed source material sourced from the Internet.\nWhen a teacher wants to check a student paper for plagiarism, a coded engine compares it to other content in the database to check for matches.\nThe software leaves all judgment about intellectual property up to the instructor.\nIn the instance where a paper indicates a strong match to content submitted to another institution, instructors may find it necessary to request to view the matching paper.\nThis request can either be accepted or denied by an institution.\nAny paper information must be passed from instructor to instructor via email, and therefore, outside of the Turnitin product.</p>\n<p>You will at all times retain 100% ownership of your intellectual property rights.\nTurnitin does not ever assert or claim copyright ownership of any works submitted to or through our service.\nYour property is YOUR property.\nWe do not, and will not, use your intellectual property for any

personal data lawfully in order to earn your trust is our top priority.\nWe understand that data protection is essential for good customer service.\nAt Turnitin, our objective is to operate transparently, with accountability, and consistently with the EU and US regulatory environment so that our valued customers feel secure and in control.</p>\n<p>Turnitin is fully committed to the following practices to protect your data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We will never sell your data;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We will never use your data for targeted advertising/profiling;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We secure your data with strong encryption and security best practices in SOC2 certified data centers;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We respect local privacy laws and work with legal experts to stay abreast of changes;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When we collect data, we use it for a specific, stated purpose, to improve your experience and our service to you;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If we need to send any of your data to a third-party, such as a language translation service provider, we require a contractual agreement that they handle and secure your data with the same high level of protection and care that we deliver.\nand</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We respect your right to retain ownership and control of your data, so that you can modify, update, or delete it as needed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Compliance Today <p>We currently meet the most stringent data protection laws across jurisdictions and are proactively reviewing every aspect of how we handle data and investing in operational measures to ensure that we continue to meet our customers\u2019 requirements.\nToday, Turnitin uses Model Contractual Clauses to meet varying, specific needs across the European Union (EU) for data privacy and protection.\nThese are standardized contracts to certify that any data that is transferred out of the EU is adequately protected.\nThis prevents our customers from having to request any additional authorization to use our service.\nWe are in good standing with all standards used to ensure that data is fully protected and are able to meet very specific requirements as needed.\nFor example, in the EU (including in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland) we abide by Directive 95/46/EC to meet data protection requirements.\nThe steps we take to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of personal data include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We strongly recommend that institutions provide notice to students that the Turnitin service involves data transfer to the United States (with the exception of Gradescope as used by certain Canadian, European, and Australian universities), and we recommend that consent is obtained from the student as soon as possible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Universities are free to inspect or audit our services any time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All student work and any associated personal data is encrypted and kept secure at all times.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Students can keep their identity secret by using a pseudonym or their student number and by submitting their work in formats that contain little if any identifying metadata.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> General Data Protection Regulation <p>The GDPR has legal effect in all EU Member States from 25 May 2018.\nThe Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC) has been replaced by the GDPR.\nAlthough it is a regulation and immediately effective in all EU Member States, there are certain regulations within the GDPR that Member States will be able to legislate upon at a national level for specific reasons, therefore this policy may change accordingly from time to time.</p> The Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data <p>Turnitin primarily relies upon Article 6(1)(e) of the GDPR for its legal basis to process such data.\nPursuant to this provision of GDPR, Turnitin relies upon the official authority of the Data Controller (the institution that is Turnitin\u2019s customer) to process student data in such a way that anti-plagiarism checks may be made to satisfy the institution that the student\u2019s work is their own.</p>\n<p>Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR also provides Turnitin with a lawful basis for processing.\nThis is that it is in the legitimate interests of the Data Controller to process such data at their discretion.</p>\n<p>Consent is not the primary basis for processing upon which Turnitin relies.\nHowever, the End-User Licence Agreement which Turnitin utilises with students will continue to be in place as a matter of best practice and transparency.</p> Key Aspects of the GDPR <p>The following are some notable aspects of the GDPR:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The GDPR applies to all personal data processed;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The GDPR makes it clear that when processing the personal data of EU nationals, data processors outside the EEA (including the US) must adhere to the GDPR and process only for lawful reasons;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The GDPR requires much more accountability when processing personal data.\nPrivacy must be embedded into everything (services, software, systems, and processes) by design and by default;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Individuals\u2019 rights have been strengthened.\nand</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To export data outside the EEA, EU Model Contractual Clauses will be favored, which Turnitin uses.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information on GDPR, visit

essential for good customer service.\nAt Turnitin, LLC, our objective is to operate transparently and consistently with the EU regulatory environment so that you, our valued customers, feel secure and in control.</p>\n<p>Turnitin, LLC, which includes iThenticate and the Gradescope service, is fully committed to the following practices to protect your data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We will never sell your data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We will never use your data for targeted advertising.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We secure your data with strong encryption and security best practices.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We respect local privacy laws and work with legal experts to stay abreast of changes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When we collect data, we use it for a specific, stated purpose, to improve your experience and our service to you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If we need to send any of your data to a third party, such as a language translation service provider, we require a contractual agreement that they handle and secure your data with the same high level of protection and care that we deliver.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We respect your right to retain ownership and control of your data, so that you can modify, update, or delete it as needed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Compliance today <p>We currently meet the most stringent data protection laws across jurisdictions and are proactively reviewing every aspect of how we handle data and investing in operational measures to ensure that we continue to meet our customers\u2019 requirements as data protection rules are reformed.</p>\n<p>Today, Turnitin uses Model Clauses to meet varying, specific needs across the European Union (EU) for data privacy and protection.\nThese are standardized contracts to certify that any data that is transferred out of the EU is duly protected.\nThis prevents our customers from having to request any additional authorization to use our service.</p>\n<p>We are in good standing with all standards used to ensure that data is fully protected and are able to meet very specific requirements as needed.\nThe steps we take to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of personal data include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We strongly recommend that institutions provide notice to students that the Turnitin service involves data transfer to the United States (with the exception of Gradescope as used by certain Canadian universities), and we recommend that consent is obtained from the student as soon as possible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Universities are free to inspect or audit our services any time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All student work and any associated personal information is encrypted and kept secure at all times.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Students can keep their identity secret by using a pseudonym and by submitting papers in formats that contain little if any identifying metadata.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Upcoming changes\n<p>The 1995 laws that have been governing how personal data is protected in the EU were developed before smartphones and social media dominated our lives.\nFor the past several years, negotiations have been underway to unify and simplify the laws and guidelines used to determine what obligations companies have to protect data crossing borders in the EU.</p> EU data protection timeline\n<p>\n<strong>1995:</strong> The Data Protection Directive creates the framework for personal data protection laws in each of the EU Member States.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2000:</strong> Safe Harbor decision to accommodate data transfers outside EU.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2012:</strong> The European Commission proposes a draft of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2014:</strong> The European Parliament votes on amended GDPR draft.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2015:</strong> The European Council agrees on the final terms of GDPR.\nSafe Harbor is declared invalid.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2016:</strong> Final GDPR version published.\nEU-US Privacy Shield becomes the new mechanism for transatlantic data transfers.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2018:</strong> GDPR regulations take effect, repealing 95/46/EC.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2020:</strong> The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) goes into force.</p>\n<p>Turnitin and GDPR</p> Copyright Protection <p>Turnitin agrees that students should own the copyright to their original work.\nA common misconception is that students relinquish their ownership rights when they submit work to Turnitin.\nThis simply isn\u2019t true!</p>\n<p>Students who submit work to Turnitin retain the copyright to the work they created.\nFor Turnitin services other than Gradescope, a copy of submitted papers is retained in a Turnitin database archive to be compared with future submissions - a practice that helps protect and strengthen copyright ownership.\nStudent work that is submitted to Gradescope isn\u2019t currently retained in the Turnitin source database, but this will change in the future with additional product integration.\nA U.S.\nDistrict Court judge ruled that archiving student papers to assess the originality of newly-submitted papers constitutes a fair use under the U.S.\nCopyright Act, provides \u201ca substantial public benefit\u201d and helps protect the papers from being exploited by others.\nRead the summary judgement.</p>\n<p>The summary judgment was unanimously affirmed by a U.S.\nCourt of Appeals.\nRead the published decision.</p> Legal FAQs How does Turnitin protect my privacy? <p>Turnitin is committed to protecting the privacy and security of our users and their information.\nWe maintain extremely high levels of privacy and security through the use of SSL encryption, redundant servers, sophisticated firewalls, multiple data centers, and privacy and security audits.\nWith a security system that has never been breached and a student privacy pledge of the highest standards, instructors and students can use Turnitin with an unsurpassed level of confidence.</p> Who owns student work once it is submitted to Turnitin? <p>Students retain the copyright of work submitted to the Turnitin service, which includes the Gradescope service.\nThe Turnitin user agreement entitles Turnitin to use the works as part of the plagiarism prevention system under the principles of fair use.\nTurnitin\u2019s use of student papers under fair use was settled in a United States District Court of Law in 2007 and affirmed upon appeal in 2009.</p>\n<p>Read the 2007 summary judgement</p>\n<p>Read the 2009 published decision</p> Does Turnitin archive student work? <p>Turnitin archives student papers by default only for the purposes of textual comparison.\nInstitutions may choose to not have their papers archived in the service.</p>\n<p>The fair use defense codified in Section 107 of the Copyright Act has been recognized as an \u201cequitable rule of reason.\u201d In considering whether a use is a fair use, courts often analyze whether the use is beneficial to society as a whole (as part of a determination of whether a use is transformative) and whether the user has \u201cclean hands.\u201d The District Court and Fourth Circuit both held that the archiving of student works in the educational context is a fair use.\nIn so holding, the courts did not find that Turnitin\u2019s use of student works was in any respect unethical.</p> How does Turnitin comply with privacy regulations of different countries? <p>As a US company with high standards for security and privacy, Turnitin is designed to comply with many of the data protection requirements of other countries, including informed consent, access rights of submitting students, and technical and organizational measures to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of personal data.</p> Am I bound to the Turnitin click-through agreement? What if I\u2019m a minor? <p>Yes.\nThe United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia found that the online click-through agreement on the Turnitin site is an enforceable agreement, even against minors.\nParental consent or the consent of a guardian is required for a minor to set up an account with Turnitin and the agreement is therefore binding.</p> Can a teacher compel me to submit my work to Turnitin if I attend private school? Public school? <p>Yes in both cases.</p>\n<p>If you attend a private school you have agreed to abide by the school\u2019s policies.</p>\n<p>With respect to public school, as the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia has recognized in rejecting four students\u2019 claim that they were improperly compelled to submit their papers to Turnitin or face a failing grade, \u201cSchools have a right to decide how to monitor and address plagiarism in their schools and may employ companies like Turnitin to help do so.\u201d</p> Does Turnitin share information with third-party services? <p>Turnitin integrates with third-party services such as the Educational Testing Service and Language Weaver where student information may be shared in order to deliver a part of these services.\nNo personally identifiable information such as name, email or school is sent by Turnitin to third-party services for purposes other than the provision of the Turnitin services.</p> Does Turnitin comply with FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)? <p>Yes.\nThe Turnitin service is compliant with and helps institutions comply with FERPA, including:\nTurnitin expects and suggests that institutions comply with FERPA\u2019s notice requirements regarding the use and disclosure of directory and non-directory education records so that students and parents are aware that the school may engage services like Turnitin.</p>\n<p>Institutions are free to inspect or audit our services to assure themselves that all information is used only for the purposes of assisting instructors.</p>\n<p>Data is kept secure at all times and are only used for purposes of assisting the instructor in assessing the assignment.\nUsers may submit their paper using a pseudonym and in formats that contain little, if any, identifying metadata.\nThis reduces our chance of collecting and processing personal data.</p> Does Turnitin comply with COPPA (Child Online Privacy Protection Act)? <p>Under the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d), consistent with the position of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), we rely on our education institution customers to obtain the necessary parental consents prior to collecting only the minimally required personal information from students under age 13.\nAs with all the students we serve, any such information is used only for providing the services to the educational institutions.\nWe comply with all COPPA requirements, and partner with our education institution customers to ensure that parents are always able to exercise their rights under all applicable laws and regulations.</p> Who can I contact at Turnitin if I have privacy concerns? <p>We are always ready to answer any question or concerns you may have.\nPlease write to us at legal@turnitin.com.</p>\n<p>This privacy policy was last modified on March 7, 2023.</p>\n<p>\u00a9 2023 \u2022 Turnitin, LLC.</p>\n<i>\n</i>\n<i>\n</i>FeaturesGrade Written ExamsGrade HomeworkRun Code AutogradersGrade Bubble SheetsResourcesHelp CenterVideo TutorialsGet a DemoPricingFAQCompanyJobsContactBlogLegalTerms &amp.\nConditionsPrivacy Policy<p>\u00a9 2023 \u2022 Turnitin, LLC.</p>\n<i>\n</i>\n<i>\n</i> ", "created_at": "2023-07-09 04:14:21.738896", "updated_at": "2023-07-09 04:15:33.616961"}], "points": [], "urls": ["gradescope.com"]}}
