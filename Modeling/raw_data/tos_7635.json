example, whether and to what extent you take advantage of any offerings, whether and to what extent you opt out of any offerings, and whether we are able to enhance the data through our efforts herein described.\nOur ability to create any value from the programs is heavily based on our ability to leverage said intellectual properties.\nWe do not calculate the value of consumer data in our accounting statements.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li> California Verifiable Client Requests <p> In 2021, we've received 917 verifiable consumer requests.\nThis includes requests from people to know,

Data from multiple sources, and our Privacy Policy will continue to govern the data we receive and use as part of the Services.</p>\n<p>Not all transactions with your registered Rocket Card are tracked by Visa.\nYou acknowledge that Visa may be unable to monitor every transaction made with your enrolled Rocket Card, including PIN-based purchases, purchases you initiate through identification technology that substitutes for a PIN, payments made through other payment methods (such as a digital wallet or a third party payment app, where you may choose your Rocket Card as a funding source but you do not present your Rocket Card directly to the merchant), payments of existing balances, balance transfers, or transactions that are not processed or submitted through the Visa U.S.A.\npayment

your periodic Rocket Card statement.\nSubject to eligibility verification and settlement of the qualifying transaction, statement credits will typically appear on your Rocket Card statement approximately 30 days after the qualifying transaction but may be subject to delays.</p>\n<p>Statement credits cannot be processed if your Rocket Card number expires or changes while the statement credit is pending and not settled, or if your Rocket Card account is not open or in good standing.\nYou may not receive a statement credit if it is not posted by your card issuer.\nRocket Money, the applicable card network, and your issuer have no responsibility or liability for the failure of a statement credit to be posted, or for any finance or other charge, or impact on any rewards, feature, or term of your account resulting from the statement credit failure.\nIn no event shall the applicable card network be considered as maintaining any type of financial obligation or deposit or other asset account or holding funds or other value for you for distribution to you.\nAny pending statement credits and any associated dollar values represent offer fulfillment amounts in process owed by the applicable participating merchant, and not your funds or balances maintained or held by the payment card network or Rocket Money.</p>\n<p>To the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law, Rocket Money and its affiliates, licensors, and service providers (including payment card networks and payment processors) expressly disclaim any warranties, express, implied, statutory, or

provides Members who pay for Rocket Money Premium Services with access to their credit report (collectively \u201cCredit Score\u201d).\nBy accessing your Credit Score through the Services, you agree to provide Rocket Money the following credit pull authorization:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I hereby authorize Rocket Money to periodically obtain and use consumer reports about me in order to provide me with <strong>(1)</strong> access to my free credit score, including periodic updates to my credit score, and <strong>(2)</strong> recommendations regarding financial products and services that may be of interest to me, including credit cards, personal loans, home loans and other financial products and services offered by Rocket Money partners.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you find discrepancies with your credit score or information from your credit report, please contact Experian directly.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>\n<strong>About VantageScore 3.0</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>VantageScore 3.0</strong>, with scores ranging from 300 to 850, is a user-friendly credit score model developed by the three major nationwide credit reporting agencies, <strong>Experian\u00ae</strong>, <strong>TransUnion\u00ae</strong>, and <strong>Equifax\u00ae</strong>.\nVantageScore 3.0 is used by some, but not all, lenders.\nHigher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts, so you\u2019re viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders.\nA lower score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.</p>\n<p>There are three (3) different major credit reporting agencies (Experian, TransUnion and Equifax) that maintain a record of your credit history, also known as your credit file.\nCredit scores are based on the information in your credit file at the time it\u2019s requested.\nYour credit file information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your credit scores can vary if the information they have on file for you is different.\nSince the information in your file can change over time, your credit scores also may be different from day-to-day.\nDifferent credit scoring models can also give a different assessment of the credit risk (risk of default) for the same consumer and same credit file.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are different credit scoring models which may be used by lenders and insurers.\nYour lender may not use VantageScore 3.0, so don't be surprised if your lender gives you a score that's different from your VantageScore.\nYour VantageScore 3.0 may also differ from your score under other types of VantageScores.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Just remember that your associated risk level is often the same even if the number isn\u2019t.\nFor some consumers, however, the risk assessment of VantageScore 3.0 could vary, sometimes substantially, from a lender\u2019s score.\nIf the lender's score is lower than your VantageScore 3.0, it\u2019s possible that this difference can lead to higher interest rates and sometimes credit denial.<br>\n</p>Get started<p>Download Rocket&nbsp;Money for free on the iOS and Google Play stores \u2013 or sign up online today.</p>Sign upGet
