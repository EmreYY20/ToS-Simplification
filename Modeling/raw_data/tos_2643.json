submitted to the Site, including text, links, translations, images, videos, animations, songs, games, and any other materials (collectively referred to as \"Content\") is the sole responsibility of the person who submitted the Content.\nWe take no responsibility for Content submitted to the Site by users.</p>\n<p>Any Content you submit to the Site must abide by these Terms of Service, the Upload Rules, and the Community Rules.\nAlthough we have no obligation to monitor, review, or moderate any Content submitted to the Site, we may, in our sole discretion, delete or remove access to Content at

Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a United States law that protects websites from copyright infringement claims for content posted by the site's users, provided the website complies with the notice and takedown procedures as laid out by the DMCA.</p>\n<p>If you believe any Content on the Site infringes upon your copyright, you may report it using our DMCA reporting form, or by sending a valid DMCA notice to dmca@danbooru.donmai.us.</p>\n<p>DMCA notices must be submitted by one of the methods above.\nA valid DMCA notice must include all of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your contact information, including your name, physical address, phone number, and email address.</li>\n<li>Identification of the material you claim to be infringing and you wish to have removed, with enough information to locate the material.\nFor example, a list of links to each Danbooru post you wish to have removed.\nScreenshots or simply listing your artist tag, artist name, or social media accounts are not sufficient to locate the exact material you wish to have removed.</li>\n<li>Identification of the work you claim is being infringed.\nFor example, for each Danbooru post you claim infringes on your copyright, a link to where the original work was posted on your social media accounts or personal websites, or a clear written description of the work.</li>\n<li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the work you believe is being infringed was not authorized by the copyright owner, an agent of the owner, or the law.</li>\n<li>A statement that everything contained in the takedown notice is accurate and that, under penalty of perjury, you are the copyright owner or have permission to act on the copyright owner\u2019s behalf.</li>\n<li>Your physical or electronic signature, or the signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the person whose copyright is allegedly being infringed.\nThis must be the person's full legal name, not a pseudonym.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of the above information is required by the DMCA process.\nIf any required information is omitted or falsified, your DMCA notice may not be processed.</p>\n<p>Certain uses of copyrighted material may not require the copyright owner's permission.\nIn the United States, this concept is known as fair use.\nIf you knowingly misrepresent that any activity or material on our Site is infringing, you may be liable for costs and damages.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that factual information is not generally copyrightable and may not be removed from the Site.\nThis includes tags, artist profiles, wiki pages, links to an artist's social media profiles or other websites, links to works on other websites, and any other factual information that is not protected by copyright.</p> Account Upgrades <p>You may submit your debit card, credit card, or other payment information (\"Payment Information\") to purchase a Gold or Platinum account upgrade or other products or services from the Site.\nWe use third-party service providers to process your Payment Information, in accordance with our Privacy Policy.\nIf you submit your Payment Information, you agree to pay all costs that you incur, and you give us permission to charge you when payment is due for an amount that includes these costs and any applicable taxes and fees.</p>\n<p>We may change the fees and benefits associated with Gold and Platinum account upgrades from time to time with reasonable advance notice.\nprovided, however, that no advance notice will be required for temporary promotions,

these Terms without our consent.\nWe may freely assign these Terms.</p> Changes to These Terms <p>We may update these Terms from time to time.\nThe updated Terms will be indicated by a new \"Last updated\" date at the top of this page.\nIf we make material changes to these Terms, we may, at our discretion, notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending
