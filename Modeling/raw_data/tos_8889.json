participate in interest-based advertising and use third-party advertising companies to serve targeted advertisements based on an individual\u2019s browsing history.&nbsp.\nWe permit third-party online advertising networks, social media companies and other third-party services, to collect information about an individual\u2019s use of our online Services over time so that they may play or display ads on other websites, or services an individual may use, and on other devices an individual may use.&nbsp.\nTypically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through data collection technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, and similar technology (collectively, \u201c<strong>data collection technologies</strong>\u201d), which recognize the device an individual is using and collect information, including click stream information, browser type, time and date the individual visited the

provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market research.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Choices About Online Ads</em>:</p>\n<p>We support the self-regulatory principles for online behavioral advertising (\u201c<strong>Principles</strong>\u201d) published by the Digital Advertising Alliance (\u201c<strong>DAA</strong>\u201d).&nbsp.\nThis means that we allow an individual

downloaded onto.&nbsp.\nIf an individual wants to opt-out of interest-based advertisements across all browsers and devices, they will need to opt-out on each browser on each device they actively use.&nbsp.\nIf an individual deletes cookies on their device generally, they will need to opt-out again.</p>\n<p>If an individual wants to \u201copt out\u201d of receiving online interest-based

participants should not be based on their interests.&nbsp.\nWe are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties\u2019 opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.&nbsp.\nIn addition, third parties may still use cookies to collect information about an individual\u2019s use of our Services, including for analytics and

Support</em>.\nIf you have any issues with the Shogun Software or Shogun, you must try to resolve the issue first through Shogun customer support</p>\n<p>11.2 <em>Agreement to Arbitrate</em>.\nIf the parties are not able to the dispute through Shogun customer support, you and your affiliates on one hand, and Shogun and any of Shogun\u2019s affiliates on the other hand, all agree to resolve any dispute arising under these Terms, or under Shogun\u2019s Privacy Policy, or in relation to the Shogun Software by binding arbitration in San Francisco, California, or in another location that both parties agree to.\nThis applies to all claims under any legal theory, unless the claim fits in one the exceptions below.\nIt also applies even after you have stopped using your Shogun account or have deleted it.\nIf the parties have a dispute about whether this agreement to arbitrate can be enforced or applies to such dispute, the parties agree that the arbitrator will decide that too.</p>\n<p>11.3 <em>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate</em>.\nYou and your affiliates on one hand, and Shogun and its affiliates on the other hand, agree that the parties will go to court to resolve disputes relating to your, your affiliate\u2019s, Shogun\u2019s or Shogun\u2019s affiliates intellectual property (e.g., trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights or patents) or your violation of the AUP.\nAlso, either party can bring a claim in small claims court either in San Francisco, California, or the county where you live, or some other place both parties agree on, if it qualifies to be brought in that court.\nIn addition, if either party brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated or either party refuses to arbitrate a claim that should be arbitrated, the other party can ask a court to force the parties to go to arbitration to resolve the claim (i.e., compel arbitration).\nEither party may also ask a court to halt a court proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing.</p>\n<p>11.4 <em>Details of Arbitration Procedure</em>.</p>\n<p>a.\nPrior to filing any arbitration, both parties jointly agree to seek to resolve any dispute between the parties by mediation conducted by the American Arbitration Association (\u201c<strong>\n<em>AAA</em>\n</strong>\u201c), with all mediator fees and expenses paid equally by the parties.\nIf mediation is not successful, either party may initiate an arbitration proceeding with AAA.\nYou can look at AAA\u2019s rules and procedures on their website https://www.adr.org or you can call them at 1-800-778-7879.\nThe arbitration will be governed by the then-current version of AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules (the \u201c<strong>\n<em>Rules</em>\n</strong>\u201c) and will be held with a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Rules.\nTo the extent any thing described in this agreement to arbitrate conflicts with the Rules, the language of this agreement to arbitrate applies.</p>\n<p>b.\nEach party will be entitled to get a copy of non-privileged relevant documents in the possession or control of the other party and to take a reasonable number of depositions.\nAll such discovery will be in accordance with procedures approved by the arbitrator.\nThis agreement to arbitrate does not alter in any way the statute of limitations that would apply to any claims or counterclaims asserted by either party.</p>\n<p>c.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award will be based on the evidence admitted and the substantive law of the State of California and the United States, as applicable, and will contain an award for each issue and counterclaim.\nThe award will provide in writing the factual findings and legal reasoning for such award.\nThe arbitrator will not be entitled to modify these Terms.</p>\n<p>d.\nExcept as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act, the arbitration award will be final and binding on the parties.\nJudgment may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>11.5 <em>Class Action Waiver</em>.\nBoth you and your affiliates, on one hand, and Shogun and its affiliates on the other hand, agree that any claims or controversies between the parties must be brought against each other on an individual basis only.\nThat means neither you and your affiliates on one hand nor Shogun and its affiliates on the other hand can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action.\nThe arbitrator cannot combine more than one person\u2019s or entity\u2019s claims into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or representative proceeding (unless both parties agree otherwise).\nAnd, the arbitrator\u2019s decision or award in one person\u2019s or entity\u2019s case can only impact the person or entity that brought the claim, not other Shogun customers, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other customers.\nIf a court decides that this class action waiver is not enforceable or valid, then the entire agreement to arbitrate will be null and void, but the rest of the Terms will still apply.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>
