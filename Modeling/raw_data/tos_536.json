mean you.\nIf you\u2019re accessing our services on behalf of a legal entity (like your employer), you agree that you have the authority to bind that entity to these terms, and \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d will refer to that entity.</p>\n<p>We also have a Privacy Policy, Community Guidelines, and these other policies that apply to your use of our services and are incorporated into these terms.\nYou should read these policies\u2014we\u2019ve worked hard to make them simple and clear, and they contain important information about your use of our services.\nIf you use our API, Discord\u2019s Developer Terms of Service and Developer Policy apply to that use.\nDiscord\u2019s Paid Services Terms apply to any purchase you make through Discord.</p>\n<p>Together, these rules make Discord possible, and they matter to us.\nIf you believe others aren\u2019t following them, please let us know by reporting it to us.</p>Who we are<p>We provide services that allow you to interact with other Discord users (such as through direct messages and group direct messages) and participate in large and small spaces (or \u201cservers\u201d).\nOur services may also include access to certain software, features, and content that you can purchase from us or others, and additional terms apply to those purchases.</p>\n<p>Discord\u2019s services are provided by Discord Inc.\nWe\u2019re

you\u2019re at least 13 years old and meet the minimum age required by the laws in your country.\nWe maintain a list of minimum ages around the world as a resource for you, but we aren\u2019t able to guarantee that it is always accurate.\nIf you are old enough to access our services in your country, but not old enough to have authority to consent to our terms, your parent or legal guardian must agree to our terms on your behalf.\nPlease ask your parent or legal guardian to read these terms with you.\nIf you\u2019re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child (who meets the minimum age for your country) to use the services, then these terms also apply to you and you\u2019re responsible for your child\u2019s activity on the services, including purchases made by them.\nFor more information on purchases, see \"Discord\u2019s Paid Services\" below.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>What you can expect from us<p>Discord is a platform that brings people together over shared experiences and gives everyone a place to belong.\nTo do that, we provide different digital spaces where you can connect with other Discord users and communities.\nDiscord users communicate primarily via \u201cservers,\u201d which are digital spaces made up of different types of channels.\nText channels allow users to interact via text-based messages, as well as images, GIFs, emoji, and other uploadable media.\nVoice channels allow users to communicate by voice and/or streaming video.\nWe\u2019re always evolving our services, and we may create other types of channels in the future!</p>\n<p>Users create servers, and users choose which servers to join and who their \u201cfriends\u201d are.\nServer owners and server admins control the server permissions and rules, including establishing membership requirements and creating custom roles and what those roles can do within the server.\nServer owners and admins also control whether to make their server available in Server Discovery, whether to publish their server invite link on public websites, whether to enable community growth and safety features, and whether to add bots or other apps.\nThese permissions, like the size of a server, may change over time.</p>\n<p>Discord is designed to make communicating with the people you want to speak to as easy as possible.\nPosts appear in text channels in the order in which they\u2019re made.\nVoice and video communication also happens in real time.\nDiscord was also designed to make it easy to share what you\u2019re up to.\nYou can stream what you\u2019re doing on your device, or you can share your status, including what game you're playing, what song you\u2019re listening to (if you link a music account), and more.\nSharing gameplay is fundamental to the Discord experience, so it\u2019s turned on by default.\nBut you can turn it off in your Settings at any time, and you\u2019re in control of whether you connect other accounts to Discord.</p>\n<p>Discord\u2019s services may be personalized to each user based on their activity, so that you can see content and communities that may be of interest to you.\nYou can control whether and to what extent Discord personalizes your experience in your Settings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We\u2019re actively developing new features and products to improve Discord.\nAs part of these efforts, we may add or remove features, start offering new services, or stop offering some services entirely (or just in some places or for some users) if they no longer make sense from a business perspective or create risk for Discord, our users, or other third parties.\nWhile we try to avoid disruptions, we cannot guarantee that there will not be an outage or change to the services, and your content may not be retrievable due to such outages or changes.\nWe are not liable for any such outages or service changes.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>Your Discord account<p>To access the services on an ongoing basis, you will need to create a Discord account.\nYou can provide a username and password, and a way of contacting you (such as an email address and/or phone number).\nYou\u2019ll also need to provide your birthday.\nIn some cases, you may be required to verify your account or provide additional information.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You are responsible for the security of your account, and you agree to notify us immediately if you believe your account has been compromised.\nIf you use a password, it must be strong, and we (strongly) recommend that you use that password only for your Discord account and that you enable two-factor authentication.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You must always provide accurate information to Discord and maintain the accuracy of the information associated with your account.\nWe may assume that any communications we\u2019ve received from your account or the associated contact information have been made by you, and that any purchases made using your account were made by you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you get locked out of your account, we\u2019ll need to contact you at the email or phone number associated with your account.\nIf your account is compromised or you no longer have access to your email account or phone number, we may not be able to restore your access to your account or the servers you\u2019ve created.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You agree not to license, sell, or transfer your account without our prior written approval.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>Content in Discord\u2019s servicesYour Content<p>When we say \u201cyour content\u201d in these terms, we mean all the things you add (upload, post, share, stream, etc.) to our services.\nThis includes text, links, GIFs, emoji, photos, videos, documents, or other media.\nIf we come up with another way for you to add content to the services, it includes that too.</p>\n<p>You don\u2019t have any obligation to add content to the services.\nIf you choose to add content to the services, you are responsible for ensuring that you have the right to do so, that you have the right to grant the licenses in this section of these terms, and that your content is lawful.\nWe take no responsibility for any of your content, and we are not responsible for others\u2019 use of your content.</p>\n<p>Our services allow users to add content in a number of different ways, including via direct messages, group direct messages, and in small and large servers.\nSome of these servers may be larger spaces, and if you share content within them, that content may be more likely to be accessed by a lot of people.\nFor example, some servers are available in the Server Discovery section of the app and do not require an invite link to join.\nOther server owners may publish their server invite link on public websites.\nAnyone can access these spaces.\nYou should be aware that these permissions are set by server owners or admins, and they may change over time.\nPlease understand where you are posting on Discord, familiarize yourself with the relevant server permissions when joining and posting in a certain space, and choose the right space, features, and settings for you and your content.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Your content is yours, but you give us a license to it when you use Discord.</em>\n</strong> Your content may be protected by certain intellectual property rights.\nWe don\u2019t own those.\nBut by using our services, you grant us a license\u2014which is a form of permission\u2014to do the following with your content, in accordance with applicable legal

example, so we can display your messages if you post them in certain servers or recommend that content to others.)</li>\n<li>Monitor, modify, translate, and reformat your content.\n(For example, so we can resize an image you post to fit on a mobile device.)</li>\n<li>Sublicense your content, to allow our services to work as intended.\n(For example, so we can store your content with our cloud service providers.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This license is worldwide, non-exclusive (which means you can still license your content to others), royalty-free (which means there are no fees for this license), transferable, and perpetual.</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to block, remove, and/or permanently delete your content if it is in breach of these terms, our Community Guidelines, our other policies, or any applicable law or regulation, or if it creates risk for Discord or negatively impacts the experience or interests of other Discord users to continue to make it available.</p>\n<p>We welcome feedback on our services.\nBy sending us feedback, you grant us a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable license to use the feedback and ideas generated from the feedback without any restrictions, attribution, or compensation to you.</p>Discord\u2019s content<p>Our services include some content that belongs to us, such as the design of our apps and websites, our art and images,

be liable for any harm caused by that content.\nYou may report content that you think violates any of our policies.\nWe have the right, but not the obligation, to review such reports and block or remove content at our discretion.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Third party features and content</em>\n</strong>.\nOur services may also allow you to access third-party websites, features, apps, or other content.\nWe provide you access only as a convenience to you, and are not responsible for the content or services available from these websites or resources.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>Software in Discord\u2019s services<p>\n<strong>\n<em>License to our software</em>\n</strong>.<strong>\n<em>\n</em>\n</strong>Some of our services allow you to download client software.\nSo long as you comply with these terms, we grant you a worldwide, non-exclusive, personal, and non-assignable license to download, install, and run that software, solely to access our services.</p>\n<p>You may not copy, modify, create derivative works based upon, distribute, sell, lease, or sublicense any of our software or services.\nYou also may not reverse engineer or decompile our software or services, attempt to

services\u201d).\nIt\u2019s your choice whether to use these third-party services and whether to participate in Discord servers that incorporate them.\nYou should review any terms and policies provided by the third parties before doing so as they govern your use of their services.\nWhile these third parties do need to follow all policies that apply to them (which may include these Terms, our Community Guidelines, Developer Terms of Service, and Developer Policy), Discord is not responsible for any third-party services.</p>Copyright<p>We respect the intellectual property of others and

complaining about, and how you\u2019d like to resolve it) along with the email address or phone number associated with your Discord account to disputes@discord.com.&nbsp.\nIf the dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the written notice, you and Discord agree to resolve any remaining dispute through the further dispute resolution provisions below.&nbsp.\nYou must engage in this informal resolution process before starting any formal dispute resolution.\nApplicable statutes of limitations and due dates for arbitration filing fees or other deadlines will be tolled while the parties attempt informal resolution.</p>\n<p>If you reside in the European Union, you may also be entitled to submit your complaint to the European Commission\u2019s Online Dispute

INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT:</p>\n<p>You and Discord agree that the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.\nExcept for the circumstances described below, and only after the parties have engaged in a good-faith, but unsuccessful, effort to resolve the dispute in accordance with the \u201cinformal resolution\u201d process (above), you and Discord agree to resolve any dispute, disagreement, or claim relating to these terms or our services through final and binding arbitration in the U.S.\ncounty where you reside.&nbsp.\nThis includes claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring before the existence of this arbitration agreement or any prior agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this arbitration agreement, in accordance with the notice and opt-out provisions set forth in section.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u200d<strong>\n<em>Arbitration rules</em>\n</strong>.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by these terms and the&nbsp.\nAmerican Arbitration Association Rules, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions (the \u201cAAA Rules\u201d), available at https://www.adr.org/active-rules.\nThese terms will govern if there\u2019s a conflict between these terms and the AAA Rules.&nbsp.\nTo begin the arbitration proceeding, either party must submit a written Demand for Arbitration (available at www.adr.org) with the AAA and provide a copy to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules.&nbsp.\nTo provide notice to Discord, please send an email with the subject line \u201cArbitration Demand\u201d to disputes@discord.com.</p>\n<p>If the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000, and you do not seek injunctive or declaratory relief, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Discord submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.\nIf the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000 or seeks declaratory or injunctive relief, either party may request (or the arbitrator may determine) to hold a hearing, which shall be via videoconference or telephone conference unless the parties agree otherwise.</p>\n<p>\u200d<strong>\n<em>Arbitration costs</em>\n</strong>.\nAAA sets forth fees for its services, which are available at https://www.adrservices.com/rate-fee-schedule/.\nIf Discord is the party initiating an arbitration against you, Discord will pay all costs associated with the arbitration, including the entire filing fee.\nIf you initiate an arbitration against Discord, you will be responsible for the first $100 toward the nonrefundable Initial Filing Fee, unless the arbitrator determines that you are unable to pay, in which case Discord will pay the entire filing fee.\nFor cases seeking less than $75K, Discord will pay the remainder of the Initial Filing Fee and both parties\u2019 Administrative fees (unless the arbitrator finds your claims, defenses, or other fee-generating activity to be conducted for an improper purpose or frivolous (under the standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11).&nbsp.\nFor cases seeking more than $75K, fees and costs will be determined in accordance with AAA Rules.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In all arbitrations, unless otherwise required by law or the AAA Rules, you\u2019re responsible for all other additional arbitration costs incurred, including attorney\u2019s fees and expert witness costs.\nThe parties agree that AAA has discretion to modify the amount or timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under AAA\u2019s Rules where it deems appropriate, provided that such modification does not increase the costs to you, and you waive any objection to such fee modification.\nThe parties also agree that a good-faith challenge by either party to the fees imposed by AAA does not constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Section while such challenge remains pending before AAA, the arbitrator, and/or a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Offer of Judgment.</em>\n</strong> At least 14 days before the date set for an arbitration hearing, any party may serve an offer in writing upon the other party to allow judgment on specified terms.\nIf the offer made by the offering party is not accepted by the other party, and the other party fails to obtain a more favorable award, the other party will not recover its post-offer costs and will pay the offering party\u2019s costs from the time of the offer.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Arbitration Decision.</em>\n</strong> The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding on you and Discord, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.\nYou and Discord agree that dispositive motions will be allowed in the arbitration.\nExcept as explicitly set forth in this arbitration section, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these terms of service, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these terms of service are void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment of AAA or arbitrator fees (including the timing of such payments and remedies for nonpayment).\nThe arbitrator must follow these terms and can award the same damages and relief as a court.\nThe arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions in accordance with the AAA Rules and procedures for any frivolous claims, improper claims, or submissions the arbitrator determines have not been filed in good faith, as well as for a party's failure to comply with this Section or claims filed on behalf of a claimant who is not party to this agreement.\nNo arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Mass filings.</em>\n</strong> If, at any time, 30 or more similar demands for arbitration are asserted against Discord or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities (\u201cMass Filing\u201d), these additional rules will apply:</p>\n<p>If you or your counsel file a demand for arbitration that fits within the definition of Mass Filing, you agree that your demand for arbitration will be subject to the additional protocols set forth in this mass filing subsection.</p>\n<p>Bellwether proceedings are encouraged by courts and arbitration administrators when there are multiple disputes involving similar claims against the same or related parties.\nYou and Discord agree to jointly ask the arbitrator to agree to the following procedures: The arbitrator will randomly assign sequential numbers to each of the claims included in a Mass Filing, after which the claims numbered 1-10 will be designated the \u201cInitial Test Cases\u201d and will proceed to arbitration.\nThe Parties agree to decide on a single arbitrator for all Initial Test Cases and to consolidate the cases for pre-hearing procedures and the pre-hearing conference.\nUnless the claims are resolved in advance or the schedule is extended, the arbitrator will render final awards for the Initial Test Cases within 120 days of the initial pre-hearing conference.\nIf fewer than 5 Initial Test Cases resolve without a final decision of the arbitrator because they are resolved in advance, cases will be selected in batches of 10 and will proceed to arbitration until at least 5 have been resolved by a final arbitrator decision.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decisions for the Initial Test Cases shall be in writing and shall contain the essential findings and conclusions of fact and law upon which the arbitrator based the decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The results of the Initial Test Cases resolved by a final arbitrator decision will then be given to a mediator who will try to facilitate a resolution of the remaining cases.\nAfter the results are provided to the mediator, the mediator and the parties will have 90 days (the \u201cMediation Period\u201d) to agree on a resolution or substantive methodology for resolving the outstanding cases.\nIf the parties are unable to resolve the outstanding claims during the Mediation Period, either Party may choose to opt out of the arbitration process and proceed in court with its remaining claims.\nNotice of the opt-out will be provided in writing within 60 days of the close of the Mediation Period.&nbsp.\nOpt out of arbitration under this section shall not be construed as opt out of the section titled \u201cClass Waiver\u201d below.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Absent notice of an opt-out, the arbitrations will proceed in the order determined by the sequential numbers assigned to claims in the Mass Filing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, any statute of limitations applicable to your claims will remain tolled until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\u200dOther remedies.</em>\n</strong> ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.\nIn some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.\nYOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND DISCORD ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.\nYou may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to your state\u2019s law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\u200dOpt-out.</em>\n</strong> You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing an opt-out notice to arbitration-opt-out@discord.com within 30 days of March 27, 2023 or when you first register your Discord account, whichever is later, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs.\nIf you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Discord also will not be bound by them.</p>\n<p>\u200d<strong>\n<em>Exceptions.</em>\n</strong> You or Discord may still pursue claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco County, California, or any U.S.\ncounty where you live or work.\nThe small claims court, and not any arbitrator or AAA, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve disputes regarding whether a dispute is properly within the jurisdiction of a small claims court.\nAdditionally, disputes concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of our services will not be subject to arbitration.\nEither party may also seek a declaratory judgment or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a party\u2019s claims are time-barred or may be brought in small claims court.\nSeeking such relief shall not waive a party\u2019s right to arbitration under this agreement, and any filed arbitrations related to any action filed pursuant to this paragraph shall automatically be stayed (and any applicable statute of limitations tolled) pending the outcome of such action.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Class waiver.</em>\n</strong> IF YOU\u2019RE A U.S.\nRESIDENT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED HEREIN, YOU AND DISCORD AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, UNLESS DISCORD PROVIDES ITS CONSENT TO CONSOLIDATE IN WRITING.\nIf this specific paragraph is found unenforceable, then the \u201cAgreement to arbitrate\u201d section will be null and void.\nIf there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of this paragraph\u2019s limitations as to a particular remedy, then that remedy (and only that remedy) must be severed from the arbitration and may be sought in court.\nThe parties agree, however, that any adjudication of remedies not subject to arbitration shall be stayed pending the outcome of any arbitrable claims and remedies.&nbsp.\nThis subsection does not prevent you or Discord from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Changes to this Dispute Section:</em>\n</strong> Discord will provide 30 days\u2019 notice of the date of any material changes to this clause.\nChanges will become effective on the 30th day and apply to all claims not yet filed.\nIf you continue to use the site after the 30th day, you agree that any unfiled claims of which Discord does not have actual notice are subject to the revised clause.\nIf you reject any such changes by opting out of the arbitration agreement, you may exercise your right to a trial by jury or judge, as permitted by applicable law, but any prior existing agreement to arbitrate disputes under a prior version of the arbitration agreement will not apply to claims not yet filed.\nIf Discord changes this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section after the date you first accepted this agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this agreement), you agree that your continued use of the Discord product(s) or services 30 days after such change will be deemed acceptance of those changes.\nIf you do not agree to such change, you may opt out by providing notice as described in this section.</p>More important stuff<p>You have certain rights that, by law, can\u2019t be limited by these terms, and we in no way intend to restrict those rights in these terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Entire agreement.</em>\n</strong> These terms cover the entire agreement between you and Discord for your use of our services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Additional terms.</em>\n</strong> Where additional terms apply to our products or

Regulations (\u201cITAR\u201d), and will not use the services to cause a violation of such laws or regulations.\nYou agree to not use our services to store or distribute content that is subject to export controls, unless you have obtained all required government export authorizations.\nFurther, you represent and warrant that you are not on any government list of prohibited or restricted

located in a country or region subject to U.S.\nor E.U.\ngovernment embargo (including Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region) unless that use is authorized by the United States and other relevant authorities.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Waiver, severability, and assignment.</em>\n</strong> If you fail to follow these terms and we don\u2019t immediately act, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re giving up any of our legal rights (such as acting in the future).\nIf any part of these terms ends up being invalid or unenforceable based on a decision by any court or competent authority, the rest of these terms will not be affected.\nYou may not assign these terms to anyone else without our written consent.\nWe may assign our rights to any of our affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with our services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Survival</em>\n</strong>.\nAny part of these terms that by their nature should survive after termination of these terms will survive.\nAs permitted under applicable law, this includes but may not be limited to the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our rights to retain and display certain data;</li>\n<li>Any amounts owed will remain due;</li>\n<li>Any indemnification obligations (as applicable) such as those listed under the \u201cIndemnity\u201d section;</li>\n<li>Any disclaimer of warranties such as those under

resolution provisions, including the arbitration agreement, such as those under the \u201cSettling disputes between you and Discord\u201d section.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Updates to these

(4) to better protect or serve users of our services.\nIf these changes materially affect your Discord use or your legal rights, we\u2019ll give you reasonable advance notice (unless the updates are urgent).\nIf you continue to use our services after the changes have taken effect, it means that you agree to the changes.\nIf you don\u2019t agree, you must stop using our services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Apple App Store</em>\n</strong>.\nIf you download the Discord app from the Apple App Store or use our app on an iOS device, the below paragraph applies to

Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) or United Kingdom, Discord Netherlands BV is the \u201cdata controller\u201d of your personal information collected through the services (as defined in our Terms of Service).\nFor everyone else, Discord Inc.\nis the data controller.\nIt\u2019s important that you read this entire policy, but here\u2019s a summary to get you started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>We care a lot about privacy</strong>.\nWe are committed to creating spaces where people can come together and find a place to belong.\nRespecting user privacy is a key part of that mission.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>We don\u2019t sell your personal information</strong>.\nOur business is based on subscriptions and paid products, not from selling your personal information to third parties.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>We limit what information is required</strong>.\nWe require the information that enables us to create your account, provide and maintain our services, meet our commitments to our users, and satisfy our legal requirements.\nThe rest is optional.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>We care deeply about safety</strong>.\nOur dedicated Trust &amp.\nSafety team works hard to help keep our community safe.\nWe also use certain information to help us identify violations of our Community Guidelines and prevent harmful content from being distributed through the services.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<strong>We give you control</strong>.\nWe give you the ability to control your privacy on Discord.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u200d</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>Discord is your place to find community<p>We created Discord to be a platform that brings people together over shared experiences and gives everyone a place to belong.\nWhether you\u2019re part of a club, gaming group, or just a handful of friends that want to spend time together, Discord makes it easy to express yourself and find community.</p>\n<p>Our \u201cservices\u201d has the same meaning as defined in the Terms of Service.\nThey include the Discord app, which can be accessed on mobile, web, desktop, console, or even a connected home appliance\u2014any device with a web browser and internet connection.\nWe also have a website, blog, and support center, and we may collect your information through other means like surveys, emails, and social media.\nIf we build another product, our services include that too.</p>\n<p>As explained in our Terms of Service, we allow users to add content to the services in a number of different ways, including via direct messages and in smaller and larger spaces.\nIf you share content within larger spaces, that content may be accessed by many people, including people you do not know.\nFor example, some servers are available in the Server Discovery section of the app and do not require an invite link to join.\nOther server owners may publish their server invite link on public websites.\nAnyone can access these servers, and you should be aware that server owners or admins set these permissions, and like the size of a server, the permissions may change over time.</p>\n<p>We may also use content posted in larger spaces, to help us improve and power features like Highlights Notifications, identify harmful content on the services, and enforce our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.\nThese things are important to us, and we believe they will make Discord even better for our users.\nWe will always try to let you know the type of space you are in (although we don\u2019t control where invite links are shared or the permissions for that server).\nYou can limit the extent to which your content is used for these purposes as described in the \u201cHow to control your privacy\u201d section below.\nYou should take all of this into account when you are using our services, and choose the spaces, features, and settings that are most appropriate for your content.</p>\n<p>We make money from paid subscriptions and the sale of digital (and sometimes physical) goods, not from selling your personal information to third parties.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>The information we collect<p>We collect certain information when you use Discord.\nThis includes information you provide to us, information we collect automatically, and information we receive from other sources.</p>Information you provide to us<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Account information</strong>.\nWhen you create a Discord account, you can come up with a username and password, and provide a way of contacting you (such as an email address and/or phone number).\nYou\u2019ll also need to provide your birthday.\nIn some cases, you may be required to verify your account or provide additional information (like a verified phone number) to your account.\nYou may also have the option to add your name or nicknames.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Content you create</strong>.\nThis includes any content that you upload to the service.\nFor example, you may write messages or posts (including drafts), send voice messages, create custom emojis, create short recordings of GoLive activity, or upload and share files through the services.\nThis also includes your profile information and the information you provide when you create servers.\nWe generally do not store the contents of video or voice calls or channels.\nIf we were to change that in the future (for example, to facilitate content moderation), we would disclose that to you in advance.\nWe also don\u2019t store streaming content when you share your screen, but we do retain the thumbnail cover image for the stream for a short period of time.\nWe may build features that help users engage with voice and video content, like create or send short recordings.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Payment information</strong>.\nIf you buy any paid services through Discord, you may need to submit a valid payment method and associated billing information, including your full name and billing address.\nOur payment processors, like Stripe and PayPal, receive and process your payment information.\nDepending on the processor, we may also receive and store certain billing information, including the last four digits of the credit card number associated with the transaction.\nIf you sell something through Discord, you may be required to provide additional information to our payment processors, such as bank account information to facilitate payments and copies of government issued identification required to identify users in accordance with regulatory obligations.\nIf we decide to process our own payments in the future, we would receive and process this information ourselves.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Information from actions you take</strong>.\nWe collect information about your use of Discord and your activities on the services.\nThis includes the friends you add, the users, bots, and apps you engage with, the games you play on your device, the servers or other communities you join and participate in, your roles in servers, content moderation decisions you make, information about purchases or sales you make on or through Discord including what you purchased or sold, and other related actions.\nYou can control whether we collect, use, and display this information as described in the \u201cHow to control your privacy\u201d section below.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Information used to enable optional features</strong>.\nCertain features, like contact syncing, may require that you provide additional information (or grant us access to such information) to make them work.\nThis also includes third-party integrations you choose to enable and the data you authorize those third-party services to share with us.\nFor example, when you link a music streaming account, we may collect information about that account such as the song you are listening to in order to display that information on your profile or as your status (if you have chosen to do so).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Other information you provide directly to us</strong>.\nYou may have the option to submit additional information as you use Discord.\nFor example, you may choose to participate in our verified server program, which requires that you provide additional information about yourself or your company.\nOr, you may participate in surveys where you can provide feedback on the services, or submit information to our Discord Support teams.</li>\n</ul>Information we collect automatically<p>We also collect information automatically from you when you use Discord.\nThis includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Information about your device</strong>.\nWe collect information about the device you are using to access the services.\nFor example, this includes information like your IP address, operating system information, browser information, and information about your device settings, such as your microphone and/or camera.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Information about your use of the apps or websites</strong>.\nFor example, we collect log and event information related to how and when you use our services (such as the pages, servers, and channels you visit, the activities you engage in, or the embedded content you interact with).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Other information that we collect automatically</strong>.\nWhen you take certain actions on other sites, we may receive information about you.\nFor example, when we advertise for Discord on third party platforms, if you click on the ad, we may receive information about which ad you saw and on which platform.\nSimilarly, we may also receive certain information when you click on a referral link, such as which website you came from.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may receive information from cookies (small text files placed on your computer or device) and similar technologies.\nFirst-party cookies are placed by us (and our third-party service providers) and allow you to use the services and to help us analyze and improve your experience and the services.\nYou can control cookies as described in the \u201cHow to control your privacy\u201d section below.\nThe services use the following types of cookies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies</strong>: These are required for services to function and to meet our legal obligations.\nIf you try to use tools to disable these cookies, parts of the services may not work properly.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Functional Cookies</strong>: These help us provide enhanced functionality on the services like remembering language preferences.\nDisabling these could affect some service functionality.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Performance Cookies</strong>: These allow us or our third-party analytics providers to learn how you and others use and engage with the services so we can understand and improve them.</li>\n</ul>Information we receive from other sources<p>We may receive information about you from other sources, including from other users and third parties, and combine that information with the other information we have about you.\nFor example, if you interact with our social media account on another platform, we may receive certain information about you like your username on that platform.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>How we use your information<p>We use your information for the following purposes:</p>\n<p>\u200d<strong>\n<em>To fulfill our contract with you</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>To provide you with the services</strong>.\nWe use your information to provide you with the Discord services.\nFor example, when you start a video call, we process your images and audio to make that work.\nWe similarly collect and store the messages you send and display them as you direct.\nWe also use the information you provide to us to create and manage your account and to facilitate purchases.\nWhen you enable optional features (like connecting your Discord account to other platforms), we use information from those services to power the feature (like displaying what song you are listening to on another service within the Discord app).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To meet our commitments to the Discord community</strong>.\nWe work hard to try to make Discord a safe, positive, and inclusive place.\nTo do so, we use your information to monitor for and take action against users and content that violate our Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and other policies.\nThis includes responding to user reports, generating transcriptions of content as part of our investigation, detecting fraud and malware, and proactively scanning attachments and other content for illegal or harmful content.\nWe also use certain information, which may include content reported to us, content that violates the Terms, and certain other content widely available on the service (such as public posts, usernames, avatars, banners, user profiles, server names, server icons, and server banners), to create systems and models that can be automated to more swiftly detect, categorize, and take action against prohibited content or conduct.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To contact you</strong>.\nWe use your information to contact you in connection with your account, such as to verify or secure it with two-factor authentication.\nWe may also use your information to contact you about important product or policy changes and to send you information about products you have purchased.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To provide customer service</strong>.\nWe use your information to respond to your questions about our products and services, and to investigate bugs or other issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>For our legitimate business interests</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>To protect our services</strong>.\nWe use information to keep our services secure, to prevent misuse, and to enforce our Terms of Service and other policies against users who violate them.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To report on our company\u2019s performance</strong>.\nWe use your information to track the fundamental metrics of our business, to perform financial reporting, to respond to regulatory obligations, and to debug billing issues.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To personalize the product</strong>.\nWe use your information to personalize our services.\nThis information powers our discovery surfaces (so that you see relevant communities or content first), Highlights Notifications, and similar features, and it helps us surface Discord features and promotions from us and our partners that may be of interest to you.\nAs discussed in the \u201cHow to control your privacy\u201d section below, you can choose to what extent we will use your personal information to personalize your Discord experience.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To improve our services</strong>.\nWe use your information to help us understand how users interact with our services, what features or products users may want, or to otherwise understand and improve our services.\nThis includes information about how you use our services and how servers are structured.\nWe may also use certain content that is widely available to better understand, for example, what topics servers cover and what content is most interesting within those servers.\n&nbsp.\nSimilarly, you can limit to what extent we use your personal information for these purposes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To advertise our services on Discord and other platforms</strong>.\nWe are proud of the product we've built.\nWe may tell you about our paid services and other features directly in the services and through our own channels, and we spend money advertising Discord on other platforms.\nAs part of that, we use certain information to assist in the delivery of our advertising, to measure the effectiveness of advertisements for our own products, and to improve such advertisements in the future.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To contact you</strong>.\nWe may use your information to let you know about new products or features we think you\u2019ll like.\nYou may opt-out of receiving such marketing communications.\nWhere local law requires, we will obtain your consent before sending such communications.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>To comply with our legal obligations</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We retain and use your information in connection with potential legal claims when necessary and for compliance, regulatory, and auditing purposes.\nFor example, we retain information where we are required by law or if we are compelled to do so by a court order or regulatory body.\nAlso, when you exercise any of your applicable legal rights to access, amend, or delete your personal information, we may request additional information from you for the purpose of confirming your identity.</p>\n<p>\u200d<strong>\n<em>With your consent</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u200dWe may also collect and use personal information with your consent, such as to send you marketing communications where legally required.\nYou can revoke your consent at any time (mostly through our services directly), though note that you might not be able to use any service or feature that requires collection or use of that personal information.</p>\n<p>\u200d<strong>\n<em>To protect someone\u2019s vital interests</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may collect or share personal data if we think someone\u2019s life is in danger\u2014for example, to help resolve an urgent medical situation.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>How we disclose your information<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>When you tell us to</strong>.\nWhen you add your content to the services, you are telling us to make that content available to certain people or communities.\nWho can access that information is determined by who can access a particular space.\nFor servers, those permissions are set by server owners or admins.\nThey control whether a server requires an invite link or is open and accessible to anyone.\nAnd these permissions, like the size of the server, may change over time.\nSimilarly, if you link your Discord account with a third-party service (like a music-streaming service or gaming platform), embed content, or participate in a server that has third-party features like bots enabled, we may provide certain information to that service or to other Discord users to operate that service or feature.\nAdditionally, if you purchase goods or services from other users on Discord, we may disclose certain information to these users in order to facilitate the delivery of the goods or services purchased or help them understand and improve their business.\nWe may also disclose your information as you otherwise instruct us or provide us your consent to do so.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>With our vendors</strong>.\nWe may provide information to vendors we hire to carry out specific work for us.\nThis includes payment processors like Stripe and PayPal that process transactions on our behalf and cloud providers like Google that host our data and our services.\nWe may also provide limited information to advertising platforms to help us reach people that we think will like our products and to measure the performance of our ads shown on those platforms.\nWe do this to help bring more users to Discord and make our business successful, and provide only the information required to facilitate these services.\nThis may include information like the fact that you installed our app or registered to use Discord.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To comply with the law</strong>.\nWe may disclose information in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is required by law, including meeting national security or law enforcement requirements.\nWhere allowed and feasible, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request.\nOur Transparency Report has additional information about how we respond to requests from governments and law enforcement entities.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>In an emergency</strong>.\nWe may disclose information if we believe in good faith that it's necessary to prevent serious harm to a person.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To enforce our policies and rights</strong>.\nWe may disclose information if needed to enforce our Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, or other policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>With our related companies</strong>.\nWe may provide information to our related companies, including parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Sale, Acquisition, or Transfer of Assets</strong>.\nWe may disclose information if Discord is evaluating and/or engaging in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale, transfer, or change in ownership of Discord or any of its assets.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Aggregated or de-identified information</strong>.\nWe may disclose information that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you.\nFor example, we may share aggregated user statistics in order to describe our business to partners or the public.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u200d</p>Data retention<p>We retain personal information until we determine it is no longer needed for the processing purposes for which we collected or retain it or for legal compliance.\nYou can learn more about data retention periods in our data retention policy.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>How we protect your information<p>We take a number of steps to help protect your information.\nAll information sent within our services is encrypted both in transit and at rest.\nFor example, we use Transport Layer Security (\u201cTLS\u201d) to encrypt text and images in transit.\nWe also enforce technical and administrative access controls to limit which of our employees and contractors have access to nonpublic personal information.\nYou can help maintain the security of your account by configuring two-factor authentication.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>How to control your privacy<p>We believe that users should be able to tailor their Discord experience to their preferences, including privacy.\nAnd while local laws may require different things, we believe that our users should have at least the same basic ability to shape their experience no matter where they are in the world.\nHere\u2019s how you can control how we process your information, how to delete or correct certain information, and how to request access to your information.\nUsers in certain places may have specific rights under their local laws.\nYou can learn more about these in the relevant sections below.</p>\n<p>\u200d<strong>Be aware of the Discord spaces you choose to participate in</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You can choose what communities to participate in and what information you add to our services.\nYou can choose what messages to send or post, who to engage with (e.g., one or more particular users or a potentially unlimited group of users), what information to include in your profile, whether to connect any third party services to your Discord account, and more.\nFor example, if you share content in certain spaces, such as servers listed in Server Discovery or with public invite links, your content may be accessed by anyone.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u200d<strong>Customize your personal Discord settings</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We offer a number of settings that allow you to tailor your experience within Discord.\nSome of these relate to specific features: for example, you can choose whether to display your current activity (like the game you are playing or the music you are listening to) in your status in your User Settings page (this is the gear icon next to your username).</p>\n<p>You can also access other privacy-specific settings in your User Settings.\nFor example, you can decide which types of direct messages are scanned for explicit content, who can add you as a friend, and more.\nThis is also where you can limit certain types of processing of your information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Limit our ability to use your data to improve our services</strong>.\nWe offer certain settings that allow you to limit the information we collect to help us understand how users use our services, what features or products they may want, or to otherwise help us improve our business.\nIf you turn off these settings, we will stop collecting and using certain event and log information as described in these settings.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Limit our ability to personalize Discord for you</strong>.\nWe offer certain settings that control whether and how we may personalize Discord for you, such as offering you relevant recommendations for in-app content and features.\nIf these settings are disabled, we will stop collecting and using certain event and log information as described in these settings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can learn more about these settings in our Help Center.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Disable or delete your account</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You can disable or delete your account via the User Settings menu.\nDisabling your account stops the processing of new data, but allows you to reactivate your account without interruption to you.\nDeleting your account permanently deletes identifying information and anonymizes other data as described in our data retention policy.\nYou can learn more about how to delete your account in this Help Center article and how to disable your account in this Help Center article.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Manage your content and servers</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may edit or delete specific pieces of information within the services:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can edit or delete any message you have sent or content you have posted if you still have access to the space where you posted it.</li>\n<li>You can edit or delete a Discord server if you have the permissions needed to do so.</li>\n<li>You can edit or delete a channel from a Discord server if you have the permissions needed to do so.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Content may be retained by Discord for use as described elsewhere in this policy and in our data retention policy.\nAlso, in limited circumstances, we may have a legal obligation to retain certain information, even if you delete the information or your account.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Access your information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you want to see what information we have collected about you, you can request a copy of your data in the Privacy &amp.\nSafety section of your User Settings.\nYou should receive your data packet within 30 days.\nData is delivered in common digital formats including CSV, JSON, and any other file format you used when uploading attachments to the services.\nYou can learn more about how to access your information in our Help Center.</p>\n<strong>Manage cookies</strong>\n<p>To control how information is collected and used from cookies on the services, you can take one or more of the following steps.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can disable and manage some cookies through your browser settings.\nYou will need to manage your settings for each browser you use.\nYou can find instructions for how to manage Cookies in popular browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari (iOS), Safari (Mac), and Opera.</li>\n<li>To disable analytics cookies, you can use the browser controls discussed above or, for certain providers, you can use their individual opt-out mechanisms, such as Google Analytics Opt-Out.</li>\n<li>Your mobile device may also include browser settings to manage the use of cookies.\nYour device may also have settings to control the collection and use of information in your apps.</li>\n<li>Third party groups also enable you to limit how cookies are used for advertising purposes by participating third parties.\nYou can learn more at Network Advertising Initiative, the Digital Advertising Alliance, and for users in the EU, the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance.</li>\n<li>Depending on where you are accessing our services, you may be able to adjust your cookie preferences at any time through a cookies banner or by selecting \u201cCookie Settings\u201d from the footer or menu on our website.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you disable or remove cookies, some parts of the services may not function properly.\nInformation may be collected to remember your opt-out preferences.</p>\n<p>Questions or concerns about your privacy? You can email us at privacy@discord.com.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>International data transfers<p>We are based in the United States, and we process and store information on servers located in the United States.\nWe may also store information on servers and equipment in other countries depending on a variety of factors, including the locations of our users and service providers.\nThese data transfers allow us to provide our services to you.\nBy accessing or using our services or otherwise providing information to us, you understand that your information will be processed, transferred, and stored in the U.S.\nand other countries, where different data protection standards may apply and/or you may not have the same rights as you do under local law.</p>\n<p>When transferring data outside the EEA, we use standard contract clauses (Module 1 and Module 2), and we rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, or other legally compliant mechanisms or conditions for such data transfer.</p>\n<p>We also adhere to the EU-U.S.\nand Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Program and comply with its framework and principles.\nAlthough the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Program is no longer a valid basis for certain international data transfers, we continue to comply with the Privacy Shield framework and principles with respect to personal data received from the EU in addition to all other applicable laws.</p>\n<p>If you have questions or complaints regarding our compliance with the Privacy Shield principles, please reach out to us at privacy@discord.com.\nIf we do not resolve your complaint, you may submit your complaint free of charge to JAMS.\nUnder certain conditions specified by the Privacy Shield principles, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint.\nWe are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S.\nFederal Trade Commission.\nIn certain circumstances, we may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU, Switzerland, or the UK to a third party outside those countries.</p>\n<p>For more information about the Privacy Shield principles and to view our certification, please visit the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce\u2019s Privacy Shield site.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>Services offered by third parties<p>We allow third party developers to build certain features or other services and offer them within the Discord services.\nFor example, server administrators can add \u201cbots\u201d created by third party developers that provide features like content moderation and interactive games.\nSimilarly, you may have access to games or activities built by third parties within the services.</p>\n<p>These third-party services need to follow all policies that apply to them (including often our Developer Terms of Service and Developer Policy).\nAs part of these policies, we require developers to have a privacy policy that makes clear what they do with your information.\nPlease review these privacy policies, as they describe what bots and apps may do with your information.\nWe also require that certain popular bots apply for access to certain data.\nBut because these services are operated by third parties, we don\u2019t control them or what information they collect.\nIt\u2019s up to you whether to participate in a server that uses bots, and whether to engage with third-party services in general.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>Data Protection Officer<p>You can contact Discord Netherlands BV\u2019s Data Protection Officer at dpo@discord.com.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve appointed

Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u200dExercising your rights:</strong> As described in the \u201cHow to control your privacy\u201d section above, all our users have control over their information and can
