2020</em>\n</p>\n<p>Please read this document carefully before accessing or using this service!</p>\nIntroduction\n<p>Most privacy documents are unreadable.\nThey are written by lawyers and for lawyers,\nand in our opinion are not very effective.</p>\n<p>Data protection and privacy are important, and we want you to understand the issues\ninvolved.\nFor that reason, we decided to use plain English instead as much as possible\nto make our documents as clear as they can be.</p>\n<p>When you read \"the t2bot.io homeserver\", \"t2bot.io\", or \"the Service\" below, it refers\nto the services made available at https://t2bot.io and https://t2host.io (and any\nsubdomains of either).\nThese services store your interactions, conversation history,\nand provide a means of communication via the open Matrix decentralized communication\nprotocol with the public Matrix Network.</p>\n<p>The public Matrix Network is a decentralized and openly federated communication network.\nThis means that user messages are replicated on each participant's server and messages\nposted to a room are visible to all participants including in some cases any new joiners.\nThis is explained further later in this document.</p>\n<p>When you read \"we\", \"our\", or \"us\" below it refers to t2bot.io's owners and operators -\ncurrently this is a role held solely by Travis Ralston (TravisR,\n@travis:t2l.io).</p>\n<p>The Matrix protocol is licensed by the Matrix Foundation which makes it available to\nthird parties who set up their own homeserver.\nThis privacy policy does not apply to\nsuch Matrix servers run by anyone else - Matrix is an open network like the Web and\nthis agreement only applies to the t2bot.io server.</p>\n<p>TravisR is the Data Controller for the Service.\nWe can be contacted as per the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On Matrix through @travis:t2l.io.</li>\n<li>By email through travis@t2bot.io.\nPlease note that email\ncommunication is often slower and can have upwards of a 5 business day delay.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Should you have any questions or concerns about this document, please let us know through\none of the contact methods above.</p>\nThis is a living document\n<p>This document is constantly evolving and being updated.\nWith your help, we want to make\nit the best it can be.</p>\n<p>If you read something that rubs you the wrong way, or you think something should be\nadded - let us know using the contact methods above.\nWe'd love to chat!</p>\n<p>We don't amend this document for any specific users or use case, but if your proposed\nchanges apply to all of our users, we'll happily update it for everyone.\nScroll to the\nbottom to see the history so far.</p>\n<p>We will likely improve this document over time and we will take steps to inform our users\nabout any updates.\nBy continuing to use the Service, you implicitly accept the changes\nwe make.\nIf updates to this document are ever associated with significant changes to the\nway we collect or process your data, we will promptly notify you.</p>\n<p>Your access and use of the Service is always subject to the most current version of this\ndocument.</p>\nAccess to your data / Privacy policy\n<p>Here contains all the information about what we collect and how we use it.</p>\nLegal basis for processing\n<p>Under the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), we process your data under\na Legitimate Interest\nbasis of processing to provide you the Service in an efficient and secure manner and\nto ensure the legal compliance and proper administration of the Service.\nEssentially,\nthis means that we process your data only as necessary to deliver the Service and for\ninternal administration purposes, and in a manner that you understand and expect.\nWe\nalso carry out processing that is necessary to provide our Service to you under our\nTerms and Conditions and processing that is necessary to comply with our legal\nobligations.\nWhere consent is required by law in relation to certain processing, we will\nask for your consent.</p>\n<p>We process your information for the purposes of providing our decentralized,\nopenly-federated, and end-to-end encrypted communication Service, getting in touch with\nyou, responding to your requests, working with our suppliers to deliver the Service and\nenabling its features, ensuring the security of the Service, developing, fixing, and\nimproving our Service, administering our business, and complying with the law.</p>\n<p>The nature of the Service and its implementation results in some caveats concerning this\nprocessing, particularly in terms of GDPR Article 17 <em>Right to Erasure (Right to be\nForgotten)</em>.\nWe believe these caveats (described in detail later in this document) are\nin line with the broader societal interests served by providing the Service.</p>\n<p>In situations where the interests of the individual appear to be in conflict with the\nbroader societal interests, we will seek to reconcile those differences guided by our\npolicy.</p>\nA note about how the Service works\n<p>We do not provide user accounts on our Matrix homeserver for anyone, other than\nourselves, to use.\nThe Service does store conversation history from the Matrix Public\nNetwork (federation) and third parties when bridged, such as Telegram and Discord.</p>\n<p>Where feasible, we will honour this privacy policy and any applicable laws for any\ninformation we do collect on you, including information given to us by remote servers\nin the Matrix Public Network and third party services like Telegram and Discord.</p>\nYour rights as a Data Subject\n<p>You have rights in relation to the personal data we hold about you.\nSome of these only\napply in certain circumstances.\nSome of these rights are explored in more detail\nelsewhere in this document.\nFor completeness, your rights under GDPR are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The right to be informed.</li>\n<li>The right of access.</li>\n<li>The right to rectification.</li>\n<li>The right to erasure.</li>\n<li>The right to restrict processing.</li>\n<li>The right to data portability.</li>\n<li>The right to object.</li>\n<li>Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We may ask for proof of identity before responding to your request.\nFor more details\nabout these rights, please see the guidance provided by the ICO.\nIf you have any questions or are unsure how to exercise your rights, please contact us.</p>\nRight to erasure\n<p>You can request that we forget copies of your messages and files by contacting us and\nmaking the request clear.\nWhat happens next depends on who else had access to the\nmessages and files you shared.</p>\n<p>Any messages or files that were only accessible by you will be deleted from our servers\nwithin 30 calendar days.</p>\n<p>Where you shared messages or files with another Matrix user or homeserver, directly or\nindirectly, the other party may still have a copy of thsoe messages and files.\nFor\nexample, if you messaged another user while the t2bot.io homeserver was in the room, the\nother participant may still have a copy of your messages although t2bot.io will have\ndeleted them.\nSimilarly, you may still have a copy yourself even if t2bot.io deleted\nyour messages.\nApart from state events (see below), these messages and files will not\nbe shared with any new users or unregistered users who view the room after we have\nprocessed your request to be forgotten.</p>\n<p>State events are processed differently to non-state events.\nState events are used by\nthe Service to record, amongst other things, your membership in a room, the configuration\nof room settings, your changing of another user's power level, and your banning a user\nfrom a room.\nWere we to process erasure requests on these state events and delete them\nfrom a room entirely, it would be very damaging to other users' experience of the room.\nFor example, banned users could become unbanned, revoking legitimate power levels, etc.\nWe therefore share state events sent by you with all non-essential data removed\n(\"redacted\"), even after we have processed your request to be forgotten.\nThis means that\nyour username will continue to be publicly accessible with rooms in which you have\nparticipated, even after we have processed your request to be forgotten.\nThe Matrix team\nis actively working on a solution to work around this restriction\nand allow you to be fully forgotten while maintaining a high quality experience for\nother users.\nIf this is not acceptable to you, please do not use the Service.</p>\nExceptional erasure\n<p>As described above, erasing a state event may result in our needing to erase the entire\nconversation history or room from our servers.\nDeciding whether to take this drastic\nstep will require a balancing exercise to be carried out at the time of the request,\nand will depend on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The nature of the personal data that is being requested to be erased.</li>\n<li>How many other users would have their fundamental rights and freedoms put at risk if\nthe request was exercised as such.</li>\n<li>To what degree these other users would have their fundamental rights and freedoms put\nat risk if the request was exercised as such.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The personal data contained in a state event is usually limited to the username, the\ntimestamp, and the conversation in which the state event was issued.\nState events only\nrepresent that a user participated in a given conversation at a given time.\nIt is rare\nthat this data is sensitive enough to warrant its erasure given the drastic impact this\nwill have on other users.</p>\n<p>Each case is decided upon based on the factors listed above.\nIn most situtations we will\nnot erase state events.\nIn extreme situations, where not erasing state events will place\npeople at material risk of harm, we may choose to erase state events or remove the entire\nconversation.</p>\nData portability\n<p>Under GDPR you have a right to request a copy of the data we have of yours in a\ncommonly-accepted format.\nIf you would like a copy of your data, please contact us and\nindicate as such.</p>\nWhat we collect\n<p>The information we collect is purely for the purpose of providing a communication\nservice via Matrix.\nWe do not profile users or their data on the Service.</p>\n<p>Be aware that while we do not profile users on the Service, third party services may\ngather usage data.\nWhere our Service gathers usage data, it is anonymized and will\nask for your consent before sending it to the relevant party.\nWe do not receive\nthis data.</p>\n<p>We also collect information about you when you input it into the Service or otherwise\nprovide it directly to us.\nTypically, this will be your username on Matrix.</p>\n<p>We do not allow account registrations on our Service and therefore do not record such\ninformation, unlike what may be collected by other homeservers for their operations.</p>\n<p>Some bridges on the Service have a capability to use your real account instead of\nproviding a t2bot.io-hosted proxy account.\nFor example, it is possible to log in with\nyour full Telegram account on t2bot.io's bridge to access Telegram over Matrix, or\nuse your full Matrix account on another homeserver to have messages sent by you in\nTelegram to appear under your account.\nIn both cases, we record the minimum possible\ncredentials for these features to work.\nLogging in may also grant us access to more\npersonal information supplied by you, such as your real name, email address, or\nphone number.\nWe do not store this information unless it is critical for the feature\nto work.</p>\n<p>We store and distribute the messages and files you share using the Service, and\nacross the wider Matrix ecosystem via federation, as described by the Matrix protocol\nand according to the access rules configured within the system.\nStoring and sharing\nthis content is the reason the Service exists.</p>\n<p>This content includes any information about yourself that you choose to share.</p>\n<p>We may need your personal information to establish, bring, or defend legal claims.\nFor\nthis purpose, we will retain your personal information for no longer than 7 years after\nthe date it is no longer needed by us for any purposes listed in this document, as per\nthe statutory recommendations.</p>\n<p>Your IP address is logged when you access the Service.\nThis data is used in order to\nmitigate abuse and debug operational issues.\nOur logs are kept for no longer than\n180 days.</p>\nThird parties\n<p>As part of being a participant in the wider Matrix ecosystem, the Service may be required\nto share your information, messages, and files with users on different homeservers or\neven other messaging platforms.</p>\nFederation\n<p>Matrix homeservers share user data with the wider ecosystem over federation.\nWhen you\nsend messages or files in a room, a copy of the data is sent to all participants in the\nroom, including (depending on room settings) participants who join the room in the\nfuture.\nIf these participants are on remote homeservers, your user ID, display name,\nmessages, and files may be replicated across each participating homeserver.</p>\n<p>We will forget your copy of your data upon your request.\nWe will also forward your\nrequest to be forgotten onto federated homeservers.\nHowever, these homeservers are\noutside our span of control, so we cannot guarantee they will forget your data.\nFederated\nhomeservers can be located anywhere in the world, and are subject to local laws and\nregulations.</p>\n<p>Access control settings are shared between homeservers, as well as any requests to\nremove messages by \"redactions\", or remove personal data under GDPR Article 17\n<em>Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)</em>.\nFederated homeservers and Matrix clients\nwhich respect the Matrix protocol are expected to honour these controls and\nredaction/erasure requests, but other federated homeservers are outside of our span\nof control and thus we cannot guarantee how this data will be processed.</p>\nBridging\n<p>Some Matrix rooms are connected/bridged through to third party services such as IRC\nnetworks, Twitter, or email.\nWhen a room has been bridged, your username, display name,\nmessages, and files may be duplicated onto the bridged service where supported.</p>\n<p>It may not be technically possible to support your management of your data once it has\nbeen copied to a bridged service.</p>\n<p>Bridged services can be located anywhere in the world and are subject to local laws and\nregulations.</p>\n<p>Requests to delete/erase data through redactions and erasure requests are shared to\nbridged services, which are expected to honour them to the best of their ability.\nBe\naware that not all bridged networks or bridges support the necessary technical abilities\nto limit, remove, or erase your data.\nIf this is not acceptable to you, please do not\nuse the Service or bridged rooms.</p>\nIntegration services (bots and widgets)\n<p>We offer a range of integrations in the form of bots and widgets (minature web\napplications accessed as part of a Matrix client).\nBots are automated participants\nin a room.\nBoth bots and widgets have access to all the messages and files in any\nroom in which they participate, however the Matrix team is working on a more\nsophisticated access control system.</p>\nTransfers of your data\n<p>If you use our Service, your data will be transferred outside of the EU to other\nhomeservers and services connected with t2bot.io as this is necessary to provide\nthe Service to you.\nBy the very nature of our Service, such transfers occur\nregularly and we have no control over the safeguards adopted by third party recipients.</p>\n<p>Where we engage suppliers to process your data outside the EU, we will ensure that\nappropriate safeguards such as the standard contractual clauses are in place.</p>\nSharing your data in compliance with laws\n<p>In exceptional circumstances, we may share inforamtion about you with a third party\nif we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law,\nregulation, legal process, governmental request, protect the security or integrity of\nour Service (security audits, for example), protect us and our users from harm or\nillegal activities, or respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires\nus to disclose information to assist in preventing the serious bodily harm of any\nperson.</p>\nCommitment to children's privacy\n<p>We never knowingly collect, maintain, or process inforamtion in the Service from those\nwe know are under the age of 16, and no part of the Service is structured to attract\nanyone under the age of 16.\nIf you are under the age of 16, please do not use the\nService.</p>\nUpdating/Correcting your information\n<p>Your information can be updated by you through the service it was originally obtained\nfrom.\nFor example, if information about you sent by one of our bridges is incorrect,\nupdating your information on the bridged service will correct the issue.</p>\nVisibility of your messages and files\n<p>In unencrypted and encrypted rooms, users connecting to our homeserver (over federation)\nwill be able to see messages and files according to the access permissions configuration\nof the relevant room.\nThis data is stored in a format it was received on our servers,\nand can be viewed by us under the conditions outlined below.</p>\n<p>In encrypted rooms, the data is stored in our databases encrypted but the encryption keys\nare retained by you.\nSome of our integrations support encrypted rooms, and they will be\nable to decrypt any messages or files for which they were supplied keys (the default\noperating mode of an encrypted room) - they will, however, discard any data not relevant\nto them once it has been processed.</p>\n<p>We use HTTPS to transfer all data.\nEnd-to-end encrypted messaging data is stored\nencrypted using AES-256, using message keys generated using the\nOlm and Megolm cryptographic ratchets.</p>\nHow we access your data\n<p>We restrict who can access user data internally to roles which require access in order\nto maintain health of the Service.\nWe have technical procedures in place to prevent\nunauthorized access to user data.\nWe never share what we see with other users or\nthe general public.</p>\nThird parties which may have access to your data\n<p>We host the majority of the Service in Hetzner datacenters.\nHere is Hetzner's privacy policy.</p>\n<p>We host much of the Service in DigitalOcean datacenters.\nHere is DigitalOcean's privacy policy.</p>\n<p>We use secure private keys when accessing servers via SSH, and protect our cloud\ndashboards with a password managed by a password management tool.</p>\n<p>We log application data (username, user IP, and user agent).\nWe keep logs for no longer\nthan 180 days.</p>\nSale of t2bot.io\n<p>In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose your personal\ndata to the prospective seller or buyer.\nIf we or substantially all of our assets are\nacquired by a third party, personal data held by us about our users will be one of\nthe transferred assets.</p>\n<p>We do not sell your data for any purpose.</p>\nData protection\n<p>All of our users' data for the Service currently resides in the same database cluster\nwhich is due to the nature of our Service.\nWe use software best practices to guarantee\nthat only people who you designate as viewers of your data can access it.\nIn other words,\nwe segment our user data via software.\nWe do our best and are very confident we're doing\na good job at it, but, like every other service that hosts their user data on the same\ndatabase, we cannot guarantee that it is immune to a sophisticated attack.</p>\nSecurity vulnerabilities\n<p>If you find a security vulnerability with our Service, please report it responsibly\nper our security disclosure policy.</p>\nMaking a complaint\n<p>We try to meet the highest standards when collecting and using personal information.\nFor\nthis reason, we take any complaints we receive about this very seriously.\nWe encourage\npeople to bring it to our attention by contacting us if they think that our collection\nor use of information is unfair, misleading, or inappropriate.\nWe would also welcome\nany suggestions for improving our procedures.</p>\n<p>If you want to make a complaint about the way we have processed your personal information\nto the supervisory authority, you can contact the ICO here.</p>\nDocument history\n<ul>\n<li>November 2020: created.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>A note

expect our code of conduct\nto be honoured.\nAnyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the\ncommunity.</p>\n<p>This code of conduct applies to conversation in any room within the t2bot.io community\nand commits and comments relating to any project in the t2bot\nGitHub space.\nIf \"t2bot.io homeserver moderator\"\n(@abuse:t2bot.io) is a member of the room, this\ncode of conduct applies to that room.</p>\n<p>Our open source community strives to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Be friendly and patient.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Be welcoming.</strong> We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of\nall backgrounds and identities.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Be considerate.</strong> Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will\ndepend on the work of others.\nAny decision you take will affect users and colleagues,\nand you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.\nRemember\nthat we're a worldwide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's\nprimary language.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Be respectful.</strong> Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is not\nexcuse for poor behaviour and poor manners.\nWe might all experience some frustration\nnow and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.\nIt's\nimportant to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened\nis not a productive one.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Be careful in the words that we choose.</strong> Be kind to others.\nDo not insult or put\ndown other participants.\nHarassment and other exclusionary behaviour aren't acceptable.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Try to understand why we disagree.</strong> Disgreements, both social and technical, happen\nall the time.\nIt is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views\nconstructively.\nRemember that we're different.\nThe strength of our community comes from\nits diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds.\nDifferent people have different\nperspectives on issues.\nBeing unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint\ndoesn't mean they're wrong.\nDon't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other\ndoesn't get us anywhere.\nInstead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from\nmistakes.</li>\n</ul>\nDefinitions\n<p>Harassment is strictly not tolerated, and can include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Comments relating to gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disabilities,\nillnesses, appearance, region, political affiliation, religious affiliation,

contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate\nlevels of intimacy with others.</li>\n<li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests cease.</li>\n<li>Deliberate outing of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent, unless\nneeded to protect others from intentional abuse.\nCoercing someone to out themselves\nunwillingly is also not tolerated.</li>\n<li>Publication of

wrong.</p>\n<p>Though our list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly welcome anyone regardless of\nidentity, gender, age, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs,\nprofession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical\nability.\nWe will not tolerate discimination of any kind.</p>\n<p>We take a position on acceptable behaviour for our community as defined by this code of\nconduct.\nWe will not endorse behaviour which is counter to this.\nWe do not have a mandate\nto promote content which is associated with an entity whose position is incompatible\nwith this code of conduct.</p>\nReporting issues\n<p>If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please\nreport it by contacting @travis:t2l.io on
