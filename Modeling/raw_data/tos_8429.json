simple, easy-to-use platform that helps teachers engage their students in the practice of a variety of \u201cforeign\u201d (non-English) languages.\nConjuguemos offers vocabulary, grammar, and verb conjugation activities and games in the following languages: Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, German, and others.\nThere are also listening activities for Spanish.\nThe typical use of Conjuguemos is the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Teacher creates a \u201cset\u201d in Conjuguemos.\nThis set contains a vocabulary list, or a list of verbs to be conjugated in a certain tense.\nAs soon as this set is created, Conjuguemos generates a range of activities that students can do with this set: graded practice, flashcards, crosswords, one-player games, multiplayer game, and more.\n</li>\n<li>Teachers assign this set to their students.\nWhen assigned, this set can be posted in an LMS, or shared with their students via a link or a game code.\n</li>\n<li>Students engage with the set in whatever way the teacher desires, and Conjuguemos collects their work so that teachers can view it instantly and see the accuracy and volume of the student responses.\nConjuguemos also provides stats on \u201cmost common errors\u201d and whether students are improving over time or not.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students can create their own account, but can only tie that account to a class after they receive a unique code from their teacher.\nTeachers are also able to register students in a variety of ways (manually, by importing from GoogleClassroom, etc).\nIf the school or teacher elects to utilize Conjuguemos with students under a specific age, the school will be responsible for obtaining any necessary parental consent under the applicable laws.\n</p>\n<p>Personal information is any information you provide to us that personally identifies you, like your name or email address, or any other information which we could reasonably link to your identity.\nWe will only collect, use, and share your personal

that Conjuguemos does not sell or rent any of your, or your students' personal information.\nWhile Conjuguemos does not sell/rent personal information, however, non-premium users will see ads that are served via third-party companies.\nThese third-party companies (such as GoogleAds) do collect information on visits.\nFor users that choose to use the site on a free (\u201cunpaid\u201d) basis, however, Conjuguemos will serve ads that are provided by a third-party ad company, <strong>Users can opt-out of these ads by purchasing a premium feature to do so.</strong> PLEASE READ THE SECTION BELOW \u201cADVERTISEMENTS\u201d for more details on third-party ads in Conjuguemos.\n</p>\n<p>We use the information we collect from you to provide the Service and offer the best Conjuguemos experience possible.\nConcretely, the personal information of students and teachers is collected and used for the following purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To create the necessary accounts to use the Service.\n</li>\n<li>To provide teachers with analytics on student progress.\n</li>\n<li>To help teachers connect with other teachers from the same school or district.\n</li>\n<li>To send email

Service).\n</li>\n<li>To secure and safeguard personal information and our community.\n</li>\n<li>To access premium features, if applicable.\n</li>\n<li>To comply with applicable laws and regulations.\n</li>\n</ul> What are my rights when using Conjuguemos? <p>Your rights relating to your personal information include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>to be informed about how Conjuguemos uses your personal information.\n</li>\n<li>to request access to personal information held by Conjuguemos, and to have any incorrect, inaccurate or incomplete personal information rectified.\n</li>\n<li>to have personal information erased where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing.\n</li>\n</ul> What are my responsibilities when using Conjuguemos? <p>We require that your personal information is accurate.\nPlease let us know if the personal information you provided us for creating your account has changed.\nIf we do not have the correct information, we cannot take responsibility for information-related errors.\n</p> What are Conjuguemos's commitments to providing transparency and choice? <p>We try to be transparent about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used.\nFor example, you can: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Opt-out of providing certain information.\n</li>\n<li>Control whom you share information with.\n</li>\n<li>Remove information from Conjuguemos.\n</li>\n<li>Retrieve information from Conjuguemos, if applicable.\n</li>\n</ul> Change of Purpose <p>We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason which is compatible with the original purpose.\nIf we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.\n</p> Contract Performance <p>When, as a teacher or school representative, or when acting on behalf of a company or other organization, you create a Conjuguemos account, you provide your first and last name and an email address.\nWe require those data elements for you to enter into the Terms of Service agreement with us, and we process those elements on the basis of performing that contract.\n</p> Consent <p>If you are a teacher or school representative, or use the Service on behalf of a company or other organization, note that Conjuguemos provides its Service upon explicit consent given by you when signing up.\nPrior to signing up, we will direct you to our Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy.\nWhen signing up, you will be declaring to have read such policies and to consent to them.\nRemember, nonetheless, that you will be able to withdraw your consent at any time by deleting your account.\nYou can delete your account at any time by writing to support@conjuguemos.com and asking to have your account deleted.\n</p>\n<p>EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS UTILIZING THE SERVICE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS OF THEIR STUDENTS AND MUST THEREFORE TAKE SPECIAL CARE WHEN REVIEWING THIS PRIVACY POLICY.\nEDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR OBTAINING, WHERE APPLICABLE, PERTINENT CONSENT FROM PARENTS, LEGAL GUARDIANS OR ELIGIBLE STUDENTS PRIOR TO UTILIZING THE SERVICE.\nConjuguemos SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY NEGLIGENCE OF THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION IN THE REVIEWING OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY OR THE OBTAINMENT, WHERE APPLICABLE, OF THE NECESSARY PARENTAL CONSENT.</p>\n<p>U.S.\nEducational Institutions and Parental Consent: Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, if you or your school decide to utilize the Service with children under 13, you will be electing to either obtain parental consent or to consent on behalf of the children's parents directly, which is commonly referred to as \"School Consent.\" At the same time, yet subject to exceptions, FERPA prohibits schools from disclosing personally identifiable information from a student's education record to a third party without written consent from the parent or eligible student.\nAccordingly, schools must either obtain parental consent, or ensure that their use of Conjuguemos meets one of FERPA's exceptions to the written consent requirement.\nTypically, schools are exempted from obtaining parental consent under FERPA when Conjuguemos is identified as a \"school official,\" meaning Conjuguemos is performing an institutional service or function for which the school would otherwise use its own employees.</p>\n<p>European Educational Institutions and GDPR: According to article 8 of the GDPR, minors shall be entitled to give valid consent only if they are 16 years old (unless Member States have set a lower age limit which, nonetheless, cannot be under 13 years old).\nUnder that age limit, processing of personal information related to minors shall be subject to parental consent.\nSchools are in control of their students\u2019 personal information and are obliged to take all necessary measures for protecting said information.\nIn terms of the GDPR, schools are data controllers and thus determine the purposes and means of the processing of student personal data.\nAs a consequence, schools will also be responsible for informing students and their parents accordingly about what data is collected, which are the purposes of collection, how data is used and to which third parties it is disclosed, including Conjuguemos.</p> Protecting Our Students What PII (Personal Identifiable Information) does Conjuguemos collect from children, and how is it used? <p>The totality of PII collected is: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>First and last name </li>\n<li>username </li>\n<li>Password </li>\n<li>Email (this is optional.\nEmail is used for \"reset password features\") </li>\n<li>In-app performance (to be seen by teacher and student) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Teachers can choose to have their students interact with the site without having students provide any PII.\nThis is done via the PLAY LIVE feature.\nWhen using the PLAY LIVE feature, students can access and use the Conjuguemos service without the need to create an account.\nIn this modality, students may have to provide a nickname, and only responses will be collected and processed by the Service.\nHowever, this section explains what information Conjuguemos does collect when teachers choose to have their students register with the site.\n</p>\n<p>Conjuguemos collects the minimal amount of information from students necessary to create accounts on our Service: we ask students to provide a unique username, a unique email, a password, their first and last name and a unique code they have been given by their teacher to join a class.\nBeyond this information, students can submit responses depending on the activities they are assigned, which will remain private between teacher and student.\nAll this information will only be used for the purposes of the school/teacher.\nIn addition, users that choose to use the site on a free (\u201cunpaid\u201d) basis, Conjuguemos will serve ads that are provided by a third-party ad company, and these ads collect information on visits.\nUsers can opt-out of these ads.\nPLEASE READ THE SECTION BELOW \u201cADVERTISEMENTS\u201d for more details on third-party ads in Conjuguemos.\n</p>\n<p>EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS UTILIZING THE SERVICE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS OF THEIR STUDENTS AND MUST THEREFORE TAKE SPECIAL CARE WHEN REVIEWING THIS PRIVACY POLICY.\nEDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR OBTAINING, WHERE APPLICABLE, PERTINENT CONSENT FROM PARENTS, LEGAL GUARDIANS OR ELIGIBLE STUDENTS PRIOR TO UTILIZING THE SERVICE.\nConjuguemos SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY NEGLIGENCE OF THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION IN THE REVIEWING OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY OR THE OBTAINMENT, WHERE APPLICABLE, OF THE NECESSARY PARENTAL CONSENT.</p>\n<p>We use this information to provide the Service to the child, for security and safety purposes, or as required by law or to enforce our Terms.\nWe will not require children to provide more personal information than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in the Service.\nIf we discover that we have collected information from a child in a manner inconsistent with COPPA, FERPA, GDPR, or any other applicable laws or regulations, we will take appropriate steps to delete the information.\nWe do not disclose any personal information about children to third parties, except to service providers necessary to provide the Service, as permitted by law, or to protect the security of the Service or other users.\nInformation collected from students (including personal information and information collected automatically) is never used or disclosed for third-party advertising, including any kind of first- or third-party behaviorally targeted advertising, and children\u2019s personal information is never sold or rented to anyone, including marketers or advertisers.</p> What children's information is visible to others? <p>No student's profile is made available or visible to the public, or to any other students, through Conjuguemos.\nTeachers may share their classes, including grades or scores, with other teachers they co-teach with in their school, to help them collaborate.\nIf the teacher chooses to display Conjuguemos in their classroom, either by utilizing the PLAY LIVE feature of the Service or by projecting via a smartboard or interactive whiteboard, students physically present in that classroom may see other students\u2019 names, responses, comments or total scores.\n</p>\n<p>EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND TEACHERS SHALL MAKE A RESPONSIBLE USE OF THE SERVICE AND AVOID COMPROMISING CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION AT ALL TIMES WHEN DISPLAYING Conjuguemos IN THE CLASSROOM.\nConjuguemos SHALL NOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR THE INAPPROPRIATE USE OF THE SERVICE BY THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION OR THE TEACHER.</p> How long does Conjuguemos keep children's information? <p>We only keep a child's personal information for as long as his or her student account is active, unless we are required by law to retain it, need it to ensure the security of our community or our Service, or to enforce our Terms of Service:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimal information: Consistent with the requirements of FERPA and COPPA in the United States and of GDPR in Europe, among other applicable laws, we only collect, use, share, and retain student personal information for purposes for which we were authorized by the educational institution/agency, teacher or the student.\n</li>\n<li>Deleting inactive accounts: If a student's account is inactive for eighteen (18) months or more (meaning the student has not used his or her account), Conjuguemos will automatically delete the student account, including all personal information provided by the student or collected by Conjuguemos from the student, as well as questions, responses or comments associated with the account.\nThe mentioned eighteen (18) month term has been calculated in accordance with the estimated use of the Service, which usually coincides with an entire school year, plus an additional period of time in case teachers want to renew the use of the Service.\nIf the day in which the account should be deleted does not exist in the corresponding month (e.g., last day of activity being the 30th of August and deletion programmed for February of the following year, which only has 28 or 29 days), deletion will be performed on the last day of the 18th month.\n</li>\n<li>Request for deletion: School officials may request deletion of student accounts at any time by reaching out to support@conjuguemos.com.\nConjuguemos shall be entitled to require assistance and collaboration from the educational institution as reasonably necessary in order to appropriately attend the deletion request.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After deletion of the student's account Conjuguemos may retain copies and/or backups of the mentioned information for a maximum term of thirteen (13) months.\nNevertheless, Conjuguemos shall not be responsible for the accidental loss or destruction of data on behalf of users.\nConjuguemos will not be obliged to recover erased data stored in backups when erasure is attributable to users.</p>\n<p>EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS UTILIZING THE SERVICE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLYING WITH THE RETENTION OF STUDENT EDUCATION RECORDS FOR AS LONG AS LEGALLY APPLICABLE.\nConjuguemos SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ERASURE OF STUDENT PROGRESS DUE TO ACCOUNT DELETION AFTER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF INACTIVITY OR BECAUSE OF THE TEACHERS' VOLUNTARY ELECTION TO DELETE THEIR ACCOUNTS.\n</p> Parental Choices <p>Any parents that want copies of their children's personal information that we may have stored can contact their children's school personnel to that end.\nAt any time, the school can also refuse to permit us to collect further personal information from its students, and can request that we delete the personal information we have collected from them by contacting us at support@conjuguemos.com.\nPlease keep in mind that deleting records may require us to terminate the account in question.\nAlso remember that before we can share the information with the school, or delete it per your request, we will, by reasonable means, proceed to verify the identity of the requester.</p> What information does Conjuguemos collect? <p> We collect the following types of information about you: (1) information that you voluntarily provide to us by using the Conjuguemos Service (described below under \"Information you provide to us\").\n(2) information collected automatically as result of your use of the Service (described below under \u201cInformation collected automatically\u201d).\nand (3) information obtained through third-party sources (further outlined in \u201cInformation Provided by Others\u201d).\nThe types and amounts of information collected will vary depending on whether the user is a teacher or student (e.g.\nwe collect minimal information from students) and how they use Conjuguemos (e.g.\nif teachers join their school, we may need to collect school address information).\n</p> Information You Provide to Us <p>There are currently two categories of users on our Service: teachers and students.\nWe collect and store the following types of information from each type of user:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Account Sign-up and Profile Information: To create a Conjuguemos account as a teacher, you may be asked to provide some basic information such as your first and last name, email address, and chosen password.\nIf you create a Conjuguemos account as a student, you will be asked to enter your first name, last name, username, password and email.\nTeacher profiles may be viewed by other teachers in the same school or when searching for it through Conjuguemos's search engine.\nhowever, no student profile is made available or visible to the general public through the functionality of our Service.\n</li>\n<li>School Information and Collaboration Features: If you are a teacher, as part of the profile information you provide, you will be asked to choose to associate your account with an existing school or you may enter a new school name and possibly your school\u2019s address if we do not have it already.\nBy connecting you with your school, the Service may enable and provide additional collaboration features for teachers within the same school.\n</li>\n<li>Class Information: As a teacher you will need to enter the grade level (e.g., first grade) and subject.\nYou will have the opportunity to change the names and passwords of the students in your class (these may or may not be the student\u2019s actual first and last names.\nit is entirely the teacher's choice what they enter here: for example, teachers could enter <i>John S</i>, <i>John</i>, <i>JS</i>, or <i>Student 23</i> to describe the same person).\nIf a teacher opts to share the classes they set up on Conjuguemos with other teachers in their school, such as teachers they co-teach with, then those teachers can also see that class's information.\n</li>\n<li>Responses, Grades and Feedback: As a student, you write responses to questions which are always of the \u201cfill-the-blank\u201d variety.\nFor example, Conjuguemos asks you how to say \u201ccat\u201d in Spanish, and you type \u201cel gato.\u201d These responses can only be viewed by your teacher.\n</li>\n<li>Billing Information: When subscribing to any of our \"Premium\" options, you will be asked to provide necessary information for processing the payment (e.g., credit/debit card number).\nPayments are processed over Stripe or Paypal.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Our use of the information above is described below in the \"How Does Conjuguemos Use the Information it Collects?\u201d section.\n</p> Information Provided by Others <p>IT Admins administering the school's account will have the ability to invite teachers to Conjuguemos via email.</p> Information Collected Automatically <p>Like most web-based services, we (or our service providers) may automatically receive and log information on our server logs from your browser or your device when you use the Service.\nFor example, this could include the frequency and duration of your visits to Conjuguemos (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show).\nIf you use Conjuguemos on different devices, we may link the information we collect from those different devices to help us provide a consistent Service across your different devices.\nIf we combine any automatically-collected information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information, and it will be protected as per this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>The technologies and information we automatically collect include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cookies and Other Similar Technologies: We (or our service providers) may use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit our Service, including clear GIFs (also known as \u201cweb beacons\u201d), \u201ctags\u201d, \u201cscripts\u201d, and \u201ccookies\u201d.\nWe also make use of persistent secure cookies: a persistent cookie remains after you close your browser (although they can be removed) and may be used by your browser to identify you on subsequent visits to the Service.\nWe may also use, collect and store information locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5).\nLike many services, Conjuguemos uses these technologies to tailor the Service for you, and to help the Service work better for you - for example, by remembering your language preferences.\n</li>\n<li>Device Information: We collect, through our third-party analytics services, device-specific information such as your operating system, hardware version, device settings, file and software names and types, battery and signal strength, and device identifiers.\nThis helps us measure how the Service is performing, improve Conjuguemos for you on your particular device, and send you push notifications if you've opted in to receive them.\n</li>\n<li>Log Information: Like most online services, when you use our Service, we automatically collect and store certain information in our server logs.\nThis information helps us make decisions about what we should work on next - for example, by showing which features are most (or least!) popular.\nExamples include: <br>1.\nDetails of how you used our service, such as your activity on the Service, and the frequency and duration of your visits to the Conjuguemos Website or Conjuguemos App<br>2.\nIP Address.\n<br>3.\nDevice event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.\n</li>\n<li>Learning Management System (LMS) Interfaces and other integrations: When accessing Conjuguemos through your institution, company or organization's LMS (e.g., Google Classroom, Canvas or Moodle), or other collaborative services with which Conjuguemos may be integrated (e.g., Classlink), we may collect and process information related to this kind of use of the Service, such as your school user ID, your profile picture, information on the LMS interface and the LTI version used and/or your school domain name.\n</li>\n</ul> Automated Decision Making and Profiling <p>Automated Decision Making (ADM) refers to a decision which is taken solely on the basis of automated processing of your personal data.\nThis means processing using, for example, software code or an algorithm, which does not require human intervention.\n</p>\n<p>Profiling means using automated processes without human intervention (such as computer programmes) to analyse your personal information in order to evaluate your behaviour or to predict things about you which are relevant in the context of using Conjuguemos, such as what kind of videos you used.\n</p>\n<p>As profiling uses automated processing, it is sometimes connected with automated decision-making.\nNot all profiling results in automated decision-making, but it can.\n</p>\n<p>If you are a teacher, we may use profiling or other forms of automated processing to show you personalized content and make recommendations through the web and/or email based on, but not limited to your usage.\n</p>\n<p>If you are a student (or the parent or legal guardian of a student), we may use profiling or other forms of automated processing to provide your teacher or teachers with analytics on your progress.\n</p> How long does Conjuguemos keep information about me? <p>We store your personal information for as long as it is necessary to provide products and Services to you and others, including those described above.\nAs a general rule, if your account is inactive for eighteen (18) months or more (meaning you have not logged into your account during that time), Conjuguemos will automatically delete your account.\nDeletion will affect any on-going paid subscriptions, which will be immediately canceled.\nFollowing deletion, Conjuguemos may retain specific portions of data in the terms outlined in section \"How can I delete my account?\" of this Privacy Policy.\n</p>\n<p>In addition to the policy above that applies to all users, we only keep a student's personal information while the student's account is active, unless we are required by law to retain it or need it to ensure the security of our community or our Service, or to enforce our Terms.\n</p>\n<p>The Service may now or in the future include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, and the Twitter Tweet button.\nThese social media features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website.\nYour interactions with these social media features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing each social media feature.\nIf you are not comfortable accessing such social media websites and using such social media features, please don't use them!</p> Advertising <p>Conjuguemos uses a third party advertising companies to serve ads when users visit our Service.</p> Why does Conjuguemos serve ads? <p>While Conjuguemos offers a Premium/Paid plan, the majority of our revenue comes from advertising.\nThis is because the overwhelming majority of users of Conjuguemos use the site without logging in or creating accounts.\nFor them, this is a free website.\nAdvertising revenue allows us to keep our premium subscription plans affordably priced.</p> Can users opt out of being served ads? <p>Yes.\nWhen teachers/schools pay for a premium subscription, they can choose to purchase the \u201cad-free\u201d add-on.\nOnce purchased, this will remove all ads from any student or teacher associated with this paid school account.\nFor more information, go to our Pricing page.\n</p> What information do these ads collect? <p>Ad companies may use information about your visits to this and other Websites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.\nIf you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please go to www.networkadvertising.org/choices.\nIf you live in the EU, please see www.youronlinechoices.com.\n</p>\n<p> In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique \"cookie\" on your browser.\n</p> Security Measures Will Conjuguemos share any information it collects? <p>As stated in previous sections Conjuguemos does not sell or rent your, or your students' personal information to any third party for any purpose.\nFurthermore, we do not share personal information with any third parties except in the limited circumstances described in this Privacy

data transfers under the Privacy Shield Framework unlawful.\nConjuguemos relies on derogations for specific situations under Article 49 of the GDPR for performing transfers of data to the United States.\nIn particular, Conjuguemos collects and transfers to the United States personal data, with your explicit consent, to perform a contract with you, and/or for reasons of public interest.\nThe

will take steps to ensure application of suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your information, and to use it only in consistency with your relationship with Conjuguemos.\nPlease note, however, that the level of data protection in the United States is not equivalent to that in the EU.\nIn particular, it is possible for United States government agencies to access your personal data based on statutory authorizations without you knowing about this.\nAdditionally, there are no comparable options for legal enforcement of your rights in the United States.\n</p>\n<p>Remember,

any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms of Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration.\nOur agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to, all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy, including any other Guidelines and future modifications, whether based on contract, tort, statute, fraud,

these Terms of Service, you and the Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</p>\n<p>(B) Exceptions: notwithstanding subsection (A), we both agree that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</p>\n<p>(C) Arbitration: any arbitration between you and the Company will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, \"AAA Rules\") of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), as modified by these Terms of Service, and will be administered by the AAA.\nThe AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting the Company.</p>\n<p>(D) Notice: a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nThe Company's address for Notice is:</p>\n<br>Conjuguemos <br> PO Box 86 <br>Newton, MA 02456 <br>United States of America <p>The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or the Company may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or the Company shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nProvided that our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, the Company shall pay you the greater of (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (ii) the greatest amount offered by the Company in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator's award.</p>\n<p>(E) Fees: in the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Service, the Company will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules.\nAny arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco, California, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.\nIf the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\nIn such case, you agree to reimburse the Company for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made withi fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.</p>\n<p>(F) No Class Actions: you and the Company agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.\nFurthermore, unless both you and the Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>\n<p>(G) Enforceability: if only Subsection F of this Section or the entirety of this Section is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of San Franscisco, California, shall govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms of Service.</p> Legal Disclaimers <p>We provide our Service using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using it.\nBut there are
