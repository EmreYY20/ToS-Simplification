password.\nThe user cannot choose a username that is already in use or which has already been used.\nThe username is unique to the member.\nThe member will systematically be asked to provide this username when using the Site in order to identify him/her and to provide him/her with a personalized response.</p>\n<p>The username chosen by the user must comply with French legislation and more particularly, with legislation relating to public policy and morality.\nFurthermore, the user shall not publish any controversial messages, political or otherwise, through his/her username.\nWhether a

password.\nThe user is solely responsible for the use of his/her password.\nThe user undertakes to keep his/her password secret and not to disclose it in any form whatsoever.</p>\n<b>4.2.3.\nDuration of Registration</b>\n<p>User registration is for an unlimited period, notwithstanding the fact that each party may unilaterally terminate, at any time, without having to give a reason and without penalty, the present contractual relations.</p>\n<p>In particular, in the event of non-compliance with these Terms and Conditions by the user, Geneanet reserves the right to delete the corresponding Geneanet account without notice, and, in the case of a paid-subscription account, without penalty or reimbursement of any amount whatsoever.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Use of the Accounts</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>A member can open as many Geneanet accounts as he/she may wish, provided that each account created with Geneanet corresponds to as many registrations, with a separate username and password allocated for each account.</p>\n<p>All of his/her information is accessible via the \u2018My Account\u2019 menu on the Site.</p>\n<p>Use of the accounts is exclusively for non-commercial purposes, except with the express prior approval of Geneanet, to the exclusion notably of any solicitation or attempted solicitation.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the user (including Premium Members) undertakes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to only

his/her Geneanet access with other people;</li>\n<li>not to use a temporary email address;</li>\n<li>never to use a web robot, for any reason.\nA \u201crobot\u201d shall be deemed to be any software

to comply with any one of these undertakings may result in the immediate cancellation of the user\u2019s account.\nGeneanet reserves the right to undertake any legal action it may consider appropriate against any users who act contrary to these Terms and Conditions.</p>\n<p>(back to top)</p>5.\nGeneanet Premium<b>5.1.\nSubscription Details</b>\n<p>The Premium subscription allows the user to benefit from, amongst other things, the services found on the webpage accessible via the following link: www.geneanet.org/premium.</p>\n<p>When a member has several separate Geneanet accounts, access to Premium services will only be via the specific username of the account for which the member is a Premium Member.</p>\n<p>A user subscribing to Geneanet Premium confirms that he/she has full legal capacity to subscribe to it and pay for the subscription.</p>\n<p>Subscription irrevocably commits the Premium member for the duration of subscription chosen at the time of registration, from the date at which Geneanet validates the Premium membership subscription.</p>\n<p>Conversely, in the event that a Premium member were to be denied access to Premium services due to a fault (<i>faute</i>) on the part of Geneanet, or due to a case of force majeure, the member can request either the cancellation of his/her subscription and reimbursement pro rata for the period during which access was not or will not be possible during the remainder of the subscription, or, the subsequent extension of the subscription for a duration equal to the period of unavailability.</p>\n<p>In order to allow renewal of subscription without interruption of access to Premium services, Geneanet will notify Premium members, by email and the posting of messages on the Site, at least fifteen (15) days prior to expiry of their subscription.</p>\n<p>In the event of subscription renewal, Geneanet will ask the Premium member to pay the subscription amount.\nFailure to pay the amount by the renewal date will automatically result in the account reverting to ordinary member status, and access to Premium services will be withdrawn.</p>\n<p>In the event of renewal of the subscription before expiry, the renewal will take effect the day after the subscription anniversary date.</p>\n<p>Access to Geneanet as a Premium member is for individual and personal access.\nIt is reserved exclusively for private individuals.\nPremium members undertake not to disclose Geneanet account login details to any third party.\nBreach of this provision may result in the cancellation of the Premium subscription, with the amount relating to the remainder of the annual subscription being retained by Geneanet.</p>\n<p>The terms and conditions of sale of this service are accessible here.</p>\n<b>5.2.\nFair Use</b>\n<p>The Geneanet Premium subscription gives access to all public data provided on the Site (except information contained in family trees to which access has been restricted by the owners and which they use for personal purposes only).</p>\n<p>This information is provided to Premium members for their personal or professional genealogical research only, within the limits defined at article&nbsp;4.2.3.</p>\n<p>(back to top)</p>6.\n<b>Hosting of Genealogical Data</b>\n<p>Geneanet provides tools and hosting space to allow its Users to conduct Genealogy research.\nIn this respect, Geneanet notably offers users the possibility of creating their family trees and of searching various historical collections.</p>\n<p>When Geneanet is not the data publisher of this data, in particular when Geneanet did not create the Family Tree in question, it is considered as a host pursuant to article&nbsp;6-1-2 of the French Law for Confidence in the Digital Economy (<i>Loi pour la confiance dans l\u2019\u00e9conomie num\u00e9rique</i>).</p>\n<p>\n<b>6.1.\nFamily Trees</b>\n</p>\n<p>The genealogical data is published on Geneanet, host of the family trees, under the responsibility of the member, who shall alone ensure the data is used and published in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>\n<p>Geneanet offers three levels of family tree privacy to allow a member to publish their genealogy while respecting the privacy of their living contemporaries, through the three following options: \u201cPublic\u201d, \u201cSemi-Public\u201d (information apart from first name and surname, filiation and /or relationship is hidden (dates, photos, places and notes), or \u201cPrivate\u201d (living persons are not displayed)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The member must choose the appropriate level of privacy depending on the persons they enter in their family tree.\nLiving persons have the right to access, correct and delete data concerning them in any family tree.</p>\n<p>If an account which created a family tree is inactive for more than three years, Geneanet reserves the right to make any correction that it may consider appropriate.</p>\n<p>\n<b>6.2.\nPersonal Archive Collections</b>\n</p>\n<p>Geneanet provides multiple archive sharing services on its Site allowing contributors to share their personal archives.</p>\n<p>A \u201cpersonal archive\u201d is any digitized or transcribed document, of genealogical or historical interest (hereinafter, \u201ccontribution\u201d), for which the member owns the rights of reproduction and exploitation, and which can be freely published.</p>\n<p>These files are published under the sole and full responsibility of the member.\nIt is notably the member\u2019s sole responsibility to ensure that they have the relevant rights with respect to these personal archives, and in particular, the consent of the persons identified or identifiable in these published archives, of which Geneanet is only a host.\nAny document published which does not comply with applicable legal and regulatory provisions (in particular, those relative to dates for release of public archives and to the conditions for communication and use as defined by the terms and conditions of the public or private archive services which held it.\nor those relative to compliance with privacy policy provisions) or which infringes intellectual property rights owned by a third party, shall be deleted by Geneanet, from the moment it becomes aware of such non-compliance or infringement.\nTo this end, the member must cite the source of the information and documents published on the Site.</p>\n<p>Geneanet reserves the right to enter into business partnerships (<i>contrats de partenariat</i>) with other genealogy service providers for the purposes of sharing and/or enriching this indexed data.</p>\n<p>It should however be noted that the database belonging to Geneanet is not physically transferred to its partners, so use of the data is limited solely to access by the Users of the genealogy service.</p>\n<p>(back to top)</p>7.&nbsp;<b>\u2018Genealogical Data Legacy\u2019 Service</b>\n<p>By default, the data and research of members that is online at the time of their death will remain online.\nHowever, Geneanet offers its members the possibility of declaring their wishes concerning the future of their family tree and associated documents in the event of their death.</p>\n<p>In order to declare their wishes in the event of their death, members can tick the relevant box found on the page \u2018My Genealogical Profile / Genealogical Data Legacy\u2019.\nIn addition, a member can write a message for the attention of their heir(s).\nThis message will be held by Geneanet exclusively for such purpose, and will be sent to the relevant heir(s) on his/her (their) request.</p>\n<p>Each member can thus choose to leave their data and research online after they die.\nThis decision is binding as against Geneanet (without prejudice to the provisions of the article hereof concerning the case of total cessation of the service) and for information purposes with respect to the heir(s), in addition to the legal provisions mentioned below.</p>\n<p>In accordance with article&nbsp;85 of the French Data Protection Law (<i>Loi Informatique et Libert\u00e9s</i>) dated January&nbsp;6, 1978, following the death of a member, his/her heir(s) may, subject to proof of their identity and inheritance rights, require that the death be recorded and that the personal data of that deceased member be updated (within the meaning of article&nbsp;2 of the French Data Protection Law dated January&nbsp;6, 1978).</p>\n<p>(back to top)</p>8.&nbsp;<b>Ownership of Members\u2019 Genealogical Data and Non-Commercialization</b>\n<p>\n<b>8.1.\nOwnership of Members\u2019 Genealogical Data</b>\n</p>\n<p>Genealogical data remains fully the property of the members who publish it on Geneanet.\nWith the exception of the indexations of images carried out on the Site which remain Geneanet property.</p>\n<p>The filing of genealogical data under the Creative Commons license \u2018CC BY-NC-SA 2.0FR\u2019 (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/fr/) does not alter its ownership but does allow the reuse of this data by Geneanet and all Geneanet members.</p>\n<p>In the case of a member\u2019s account being deleted, certain data, particularly the collaborative genealogical data published by the respective member, will remain accessible on Geneanet.\nThis includes, for example, old postcards, photos of tombs or monuments, family crests, and records.</p>\n<p>\n<b>8.2.\nNon-Commercialization of Members\u2019 Genealogical Data&nbsp;</b>\n</p>\n<p>\u2018Non-commercialization\u2019 means that Geneanet undertakes NOT TO SELL to third-party companies the information submitted freely and free of charge by its members via the sharing services as defined in article 6 of these Terms and Conditions proposed by Geneanet.</p>\n<p>For the avoidance of doubt, \u2018non-commercialization\u2019 does not prevent Geneanet from using the information submitted by its members to set up services or options reserved for its Premium members, such as research, notifications or matches.</p>\n<p>(back to top)</p>9.&nbsp;<b>\u2018Discussion Forum\u2019 Service</b>\n<p>With respect to the use of discussion forums, a Charter including \u2018advice for posting a message\u2019 is displayed at the top of certain discussion forums.\nThe Charter and \u2018advice for posting a message\u2019 must be read and respected prior to sending a message on the forum.\nMessages not conforming to the guidelines may be subject to modification, deletion and/or the exclusion of the member concerned.</p>\n<p>The user expressly recognizes that forums are exclusively for sharing information between, and for providing assistance to, other users, relating to genealogy.\nUsers undertake not to use the forums for any other purposes (particularly political and religious) and shall refrain from using controversial usernames or profile images and any behavior that may be judged as damaging to the convivial nature of the service.\nUsers expressly acknowledge Geneanet\u2019s right to delete any messages, images and/or pseudonyms that breach this provision.</p>\n<p>Users undertake not to use this service for commercial purposes, or, generally, to propose products or services remunerating them either directly or indirectly.</p>\n<p>Users undertake not to direct Internet users, directly (via a hyperlink) or indirectly, to other Internet sites that may not comply with applicable legislation and these Terms and Conditions.</p>\n<p>All advertising messages, special offers or sponsoring that remunerates the user in any form whatsoever is forbidden within the service, unless with the prior written consent of Geneanet.\nIn the absence of prior agreement, Geneanet alone has the right to publish advertising messages on any page of its Site, including, in particular, the pages of family trees.</p>\n<p>(back to top)</p>10.\n<b>\u2018Geneanet Mailbox\u2019 Service</b>\n<p>Geneanet provides a messaging system, of which it is the owner, for its members to allow them to exchange messages relating to genealogy in an exclusively non-commercial context.</p>\n<p>All messages sent by a member to a single addressee via the Site\u2019s internal messaging system is considered a private correspondence, for which the sender of the message is solely responsible.\nGeneanet cannot be held responsible for the contents of private messages between members sent via the internal messaging system.</p>\n<p>In cases of abuse or misuse of the messaging system (notably by sending \u2018spam\u2019 aimed at canvassing, in the event of insulting language, harassment or any other form of prejudicial behavior that compromises the harmonious use of the Services) Geneanet reserves the right to delete the account of an offending member 24 hours after having notified that member by email or internal message.\nNo claim may be made in this respect by the member whose account has been deleted.</p>\n<p>(back to top)</p>11.&nbsp;<b>Users\u2019 Liability</b>\n<p>The user is solely responsible for any data whatsoever that he/she provides to Geneanet and/or publishes on the Site, as well as any messages and opinions expressed, whether through his/her Geneanet account, user content, forum discussions or in any other manner.</p>\n<p>The user undertakes to ensure that this data is not likely to undermine the legitimate interests of any third parties whoever they may be.\nIn particular, the user undertakes to respect the image rights of third parties, the right to privacy and intellectual property rights.\nThe user undertakes not to slander (<i>diffamer</i>) or insult (<i>injurier</i>).\nIn more general terms, the user undertakes to not contravene the applicable legal or regulatory provisions.</p>\n<p>The User is fully aware that he/she is the publisher of the Family Tree that he/she creates and that he/she is considered as such under the law, Geneanet\u2019s liability being limited to that of a host pursuant to article 6-1-2 of the French Law for Confidence in the Digital Economy (<i>Loi pour la confiance dans l\u2019\u00e9conomie num\u00e9rique</i>).</p>\n<p>In this respect, the user undertakes to indemnify Geneanet for and against any claims and/or actions and/or complaints based directly or indirectly on this information and/or data, which may be brought against Geneanet.\nIn particular, the user undertakes to bear the cost of any payments whatsoever, which may be claimed from Geneanet, or payments which Geneanet may be ordered to make by a Court decision, including lawyers\u2019 fees and court expenses.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the user undertakes to indemnify Geneanet for and against any detrimental consequences directly or indirectly related to the use that he/she makes of the service.</p>\n<p>This undertaking also applies as regards Geneanet\u2019s partners.</p>\n<p>In the event that Geneanet decides that a user\u2019s account contains comments or data manifestly contrary to applicable legal or regulatory provisions, Geneanet reserves the right to delete the said comments or data without notice.\nIn this event the user has no right of recourse.</p>\n<p>The user is solely responsible for all consequences, direct or indirect, of hyperlinks the user proposes between the Site and another website.</p>\n<p>The user undertakes to respect the image and reputation of Geneanet and not to make any declarations and/or actions whatsoever which may be detrimental to Geneanet.\nIn general terms, the user shall not take any action that impedes the smooth functioning of the Site.</p>\n<p>As Geneanet seeks to provide reliable information, users are requested to cite the source of all information and data that they communicate via the Site.\nGeneanet in no way guarantees the authenticity and/or reliability of information and data provided by a user.</p>\n<p>(back to top)</p>12.&nbsp;<b>Geneanet\u2019s Liability</b>\n<b>12.1.\nHyperlinks</b>\n<p>The website may provide hyperlinks that give access to other websites published and managed by third parties, particularly within the search results of the Geneanet database.\nGeneanet cannot be held liable, directly or indirectly, in the event that a
