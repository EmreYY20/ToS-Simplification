access.</strong> You have the right to know whether we process personal data relating to you and to obtain a copy of the personal data we process about you.\nYou also have the right to supplementary information similar to the information in this privacy notice to understand how we are using your data, e.g.\nwhy we are processing it, what categories of personal data it concerns and for how long we

legal claims.\nThere may also be situations where we need to verify e.g.\nthe accuracy of the personal data concerned or where we disagree with each other to the extent we need to assess whether we can still process your personal data in spite of your objection.\nIn such cases, you have the alternative to obtain that we restrict the processing of the personal data concerned which means (i) we
