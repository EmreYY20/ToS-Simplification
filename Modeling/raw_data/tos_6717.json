of your personal information, including your email address, to any outside third party unless we are required by law to do so.\nWe may occasionally contact you via email with product updates that we feel will improve your experience with the iMenuPro service.\nThese emails will always include a prominent, and effective, unsubscribe link.</p> Securing Your Information <p>SoftCafe endeavors to safeguard personal information to ensure that such information is kept private.\nHowever, unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, the inherent insecurity of the Internet and other factors, may compromise the security of your personal information at any time.\nTherefore we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.</p> International Users <p>If you are located
