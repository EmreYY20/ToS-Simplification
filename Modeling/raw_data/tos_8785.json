2022</i>\n</p>\n<p>This is a legal agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d) between you and LeapFrog Enterprises, Inc.\n(\u201cLeapFrog\u201d).\nLeapFrog is offering a subscription service that provides subscribers with access to LeapFrog Academy\u2122 content for use on certain compatible devices (the \u201cSubscription Service\u201d or \u201cService\u201d).\nYou must be at least 18 years of age to purchase the Subscription Service.\nPLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE.\nIF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT USE THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE.\nBY ACCESSING, USING OR ORDERING THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES YOU AFFIRM THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT AND UNDERSTAND, AGREE AND CONSENT TO ALL TERMS CONTAINED THEREIN.</p>\n<p>If you agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions below, click the \u201cSubmit\u201d button.\nBy clicking \u201cSubmit,\u201d you are agreeing on your own behalf and/or on behalf of your dependents to the terms and conditions stated below.\nIf you cannot agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not click \u201cSubmit,\u201d and you will not be permitted to use the Subscription Service.</p>\n<p>LeapFrog may change the terms of the Agreement at any time by posting the amended Agreement to LeapFrog Terms of Use.\nYou should check the LeapFrog website from time to time to review the current Agreement as it is binding on you.\nYour continued use of the Subscription Service will constitute your acceptance of the amended Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<b>LeapFrog Terms of Use and Software License Agreement</b>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that you and LeapFrog are parties to LeapFrog\u2019s standard&nbsp;Terms of Use&nbsp;(the \u201cTerms\u201d), which sets forth the terms and conditions for your use of the LeapFrog Services.\nThe Subscription Service will be considered a \u201cLeapFrog Service\u201d for purposes of the Terms, and you agree to comply with the Terms, as well as all other agreements, policies, rules and guidelines incorporated therein, each of which is incorporated into this Agreement.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this includes, but is not limited to the&nbsp;LeapFrog Software License Agreement and the LeapFrog Privacy Policy.\nCertain provisions of agreements incorporated herein are repeated herein, but do not negate your obligation to read and abide them.\nIn the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of any other agreement between you and LeapFrog, the provisions of this Agreement will control, but only with respect to the Subscription Service.</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<b>Nature of the Subscription Service</b>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>You understand and acknowledge that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>LeapFrog reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to make changes to the Subscription Service from time to time or withdraw or discontinue the Subscription service to the maximum extent permissible under applicable law;</li>\n<li>LeapFrog may continually test various aspects of the Subscription Service, including service levels, plans, promotional features, availability of content, delivery and pricing.\nThe provision of a particular subscription, plan, package, offer, or promotion in one instance does not entitle anyone else to such arrangement in the future under similar or different circumstances;</li>\n<li>In LeapFrog\u2019s sole discretion, the subscription fees for the Subscription Service may vary among subscribers (with LeapFrog expressly reserving the right to provide the Subscription Service to other subscribers at no cost) and, upon prior notice as required by applicable law, increase such fees at any time;</li>\n<li>Access to the Subscription Service will end upon cancellation or termination of the Subscription Service.\nand</li>\n<li>Wi-Fi connection is required to access the Subscription Service.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Without limiting the foregoing, LeapFrog will not be liable to you or any third party for any modification or cessation of the Subscription Service or modification to fees or other charges for the Subscription Service.</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<b>Subscription Service Details</b>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>1.\n<u>Billing.\nRecurrence.\nStart Date</u>\n</p>\n<p>By providing a credit card or using another payment method accepted by LeapFrog (\u201cPayment Method\u201d) for your subscription to LeapFrog Academy, you are expressly agreeing that we are authorized to charge you a subscription fee, any other fees for additional services you may purchase, and any applicable taxes in connection with your use of the Subscription Service to the Payment Method.\nIf you want to use a different Payment Method than the one you signed up to use during registration, or if there is a change in your credit card validity or expiration date, you may edit your Payment Method information by logging on to leapfrog.com and clicking the \u201cLeapFrog Academy Subscription\u201d link on the \u201cMy Account\u201d page.\nThe terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer, or other provider of your chosen Payment Method.</p>\n<p>When you provide a credit card to access the Subscription Service, including in connection with a trial period offer, our system will attempt to verify the information you entered.\nWe do this by processing an authorization hold, which is a standard practice.\nWe do not charge you in connection with this authorization hold.\nIn some instances, your credit limit or balance may reflect the authorization hold during your free trial period.\nIf your credit card expires and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your subscription, you authorize us to continue billing, and you will remain responsible for any uncollected amounts.</p>\n<p>Your subscription will continue indefinitely until cancelled by you.\nAfter your initial subscription commitment period (\u201cSubscription Term\u201d), and again after any subsequent Subscription Term, your subscription will automatically continue for an additional equivalent period, at the price you agreed to when subscribing.\nYou agree your subscription will be subject to this automatic renewal feature.\nIf you do not wish your account to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, please log on to leapfrog.com and click the \u201cLeapFrog Academy Subscription\u201d link on the \u201cMy Account\u201d page, and follow the instructions there.\nIf you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current Subscription Term.\nyour subscription will not be renewed after your then-current Subscription Term expires.\nHowever, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current Subscription Term.\nBy subscribing, you authorize LeapFrog to charge your Payment Method now and again at the beginning of any subsequent Subscription Term.</p>\n<p>The applicable subscription fee will be billed at the beginning of your subscription or expiration of your free trial period, if any, whichever is earlier (\u201cSubscription Start Date\u201d), and on each renewal thereafter unless and until you cancel your subscription or the account or service is otherwise suspended or discontinued pursuant to this Agreement.\nIn the event the Subscription Start Date is a day not contained in a given month, we will bill your Payment Method on the last day of such month.\nFor example, if you have a monthly subscription and became a paying subscriber on January 31, your Payment Method would next be billed on February 28.</p>\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Fees and Credits</u>\n</p>\n<p>As used throughout this Agreement, \u201cbilling the applicable subscription fee\u201d shall indicate a charge or debit, as applicable, against your Payment Method for the subscription fee as stated at the time of purchase (which may be adjusted by LeapFrog pursuant to this Agreement) plus any applicable taxes.\nLeapFrog may change the subscription fee or other charges for the Subscription Service from time to time.\nIf LeapFrog increases the subscription fee or other charges for the Subscription Service, we will give you advance notice of these changes by email and you authorize LeapFrog to charge you the increased fee or charge unless you cancel the Subscription Service within the time frame provided in such email.\nHowever, we may not notify you of changes in any applicable taxes.</p>\n<p>Very rarely, if there are special circumstances where LeapFrog determines it is appropriate (e.g., the Subscription Service is unavailable for days due to technical difficulties), we may provide credits to affected subscribers.\nThe amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at LeapFrog\u2019s sole and absolute discretion, and the provision of credits in one instance does not entitle anyone to credits in the future under similar or different circumstances.</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to pursue any amounts you fail to pay in connection with the Subscription Service.\nYou will remain liable for all such amounts and all costs incurred in connection with the collection of these amounts, including, without limitation, bank overdraft fees, collection agency fees, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, and arbitration or court costs.</p>\n<p>3.&nbsp.\n<u>Subscription Upgrades and Downgrades</u>\n</p>\n<p>If you wish to upgrade your Subscription Service to one with a longer Subscription Term, your current subscription will continue until the end of that Subscription Term, at which point the upgraded Subscription Term will begin, and you will then be billed for the upgraded Subscription Service.\nFor example, if you have a monthly subscription and are billed the first of each month, and you upgrade to a six-month Subscription Term on the fifteenth of a given month, your current monthly Subscription Term will continue through the end of that month, and you will be billed the first of the following month for the upgraded Subscription Service, unless you cancel your subscription entirely.</p>\n<p>If you wish to downgrade your Subscription Service to one with a shorter Subscription Term, you may cancel your current subscription and sign up again for the Subscription Service of your choice.\nWhen you cancel your subscription, you will continue to have access to your current Subscription Service until the end of that Subscription Term, at which time the new Subscription Term and billing cycle will begin.</p>\n<p>4.&nbsp.\n<u>Free Trial Periods</u>\n</p>\n<p>If your subscription includes a free trial period, we will automatically bill your Payment Method for the initial subscription fee on the Subscription Start Date unless you cancel prior to 11:45 p.m.\nCoordinated Universal Time (UTC) on the last day of your trial period.\nLeapFrog may not provide notice that your trial period is ending.\nHowever, you may view the specific details of your Subscription Service, including your free trial period end date by clicking \u201cLeapFrog Academy Subscription\u201d on the \u201cMy Account\u201d page at leapfrog.com.</p>\n<p>5.&nbsp.\n<u>Communication and Feedback</u>\n</p>\n<p>For purposes of communicating with LeapFrog about the Subscription Service, you agree to provide an accurate mailing address and email address, and you acknowledge and agree that LeapFrog may communicate with you to the extent consistent with applicable law for purposes of understanding the quality and usability of the services and related marketplace considerations, as well as soliciting Feedback from you regarding the Subscription Service.</p>\n<p>6.&nbsp.\n<u>Cancellation</u>\n</p>\n<p>You may cancel your subscription at any time by 1) logging on to leapfrog.com/academy and clicking the \u201cLeapFrog Academy Subscription\u201d link on the \u201cMy Account\u201d page, 2) send an email to support@leapfrog.com with topic \u201cLeapFrog Academy-Cancel subscription\u201d, or 3) call to: (US and Canada) 1-800-701-5327.\n(UK) +44(0)1702 200 244.\n(AU) 1800 862 155 for enquiry.\nYou must cancel your subscription before it renews each Subscription Term to avoid the next billing cycle.\nLeapFrog will not prorate, credit, or provide partial payments for Subscription Services cancelled before the end of the Subscription Term in which you cancel.</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<b>Additional Provisions</b>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES: THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE, INCLUDING RELATED CONTENT AND SOFTWARE, ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ARE PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.\nWITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LEAPFROG DOES NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, COMPLETENESS, AVAILABILITY, SECURITY, COMPATIBILITY OR NONINFRINGEMENT.\nOR THAT THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, FREE OF VIRUSES AND OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, ACCURATE, ERROR FREE OR RELIABLE.</p>\n<p>Severability: If any provision of the Agreement shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from the Agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.<br>\n<br>\nSurvival: The provisions of the Agreement, which by their nature should survive the expiration or termination of the Agreement, including without limitation the section on \u201cNature of Subscription Service,\u201d shall survive such expiration or termination.<br>\n<br>\nWaiver: No waiver of any provision of the Agreement by LeapFrog shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision.\nLeapFrog\u2019s failure to assert any right or provision under the Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>\n<p>Applicable Law: The Courts in some countries will not apply California law to some types of disputes.\nIf you reside in the country where California law is excluded from applying, your country\u2019s laws will apply to such disputes related to these terms.\nOtherwise, you agree that the laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California\u2019s choice of law rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services.\nSimilarly, all disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, U.S.A.\nunless the courts in your country will not permit you to consent to the jurisdiction and venue of the courts in Santa Clara County, California, U.S.A.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Questions/Comments/Concerns: If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about the Agreement, the Subscription Service or our products, in general, email

customers\u2019 concerns can be resolved by calling Customer Service at (800) 701-5327.\nIn the event Customer Service is unable to resolve a complaint to your satisfaction, this section explains how any Disputes (as defined below) are resolved through arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Choice of Law:</i> This agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Venue:</i> If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you if you continue the arbitration.\nIf you do not choose a location, the arbitration will be held in Alameda County, California.\nFor residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in Alameda County, California, United States of America, and you and LeapFrog agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located there, in order to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Informal Negotiation:</i> Any party who intends to seek arbitration must first provide to the other party a written notice of the Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d), describing the facts and circumstances of the Dispute and the specific relief sought, and including any supporting documentation.\nThe Notice must be mailed via certified or registered mail to: LeapFrog Enterprises, Inc., 2200 Powell Street, Suite 500, Emeryville, California 94608, USA, Attention: Legal/Arbitration Notice or to you at any billing and/or shipping address in your online account or other known address.\nIf we are unable to reach an agreement through informal negotiation to resolve the Dispute within 60 days after the Notice is received, either party may commence arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Procedures:</i> If you and LeapFrog do not resolve a dispute by informal negotiation, the dispute shall be settled by binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act (the \u201cFAA\u201d).\nThe FAA and federal arbitration law apply to these Terms.\nThere is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.\nHowever, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow these terms of use as a court would.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award is binding and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nAny arbitration under these terms of use shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d), and pursuant to the then applicable AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures.\nYou can obtain copies of the AAA Rules at AAA\u2019s website (www.adr.org) or by calling 800-778-7879.\nYou may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, in person in the county where you live, or at another mutually agreed location.</p>\n<p>\n<i>No class actions or consolidation of Disputes:</i> To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we agree that any Dispute resolution proceeding will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, collective, private attorney general, or representative action, and you further agree that you will not be a member of any putative or actual class in a class action brought by anyone else, nor will you sell, assign, or transfer any Dispute.\nUnless we both agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate other persons\u2019 claims with yours or ours, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, multi-claimant or class arbitration proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief, order us to pay any monies, or take any actions with respect to persons other than you, and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that your individual dispute, unless we explicitly consent in advance, after an arbitrator is selected, to permit the arbitrator to enter such an order.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Enforceability:</i> If any portion of this section is found to be void or unenforceable as to a particular claim, then that claim (and only that claim) shall be resolved in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California rather than in arbitration.\nif there is no federal jurisdiction, the case shall be resolved in state courts located in Alameda County, California.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Survival after Termination: </i>This Agreement to Arbitrate and Waive Class Claims will survive after the terms of use terminate or your use of the Site ends.\nAny cause of action or claim you may have with respect to the Site, products, or services must be commenced within one year after the claim or cause of action arises or be barred forever, or to the fullest extent permissible by applicable law.\nNotwithstanding the other provisions in this section, if we have a reasonable basis to believe that you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate any of our intellectual property rights, we may bring suit in state courts located in Alameda County, California, or, if brought in a federal district court, United States District Court for the Northern District of California, rather than through arbitration.\nYou agree that you will submit to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Alameda County, California.</p>\n<p>THE ABOVE PROVISIONS ON CHOICE OF LAW AND VENUE DO NOT AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS AS A CONSUMER THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER THE LAW IN YOUR USUAL PLACE OF RESIDENCE, INCLUDING, WHERE APPLICABLE, YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM RELATING TO THESE TERMS BEFORE THE COMPETENT COURT OF YOUR PLACE OF HABITUAL RESIDENCE.</p>\n<p>\n<b>13.\nOther Provisions</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Submissions and Unsolicited Ideas Policies:</i> Our company policy does not allow us to accept or consider unsolicited creative ideas, suggestions or materials.\nIn connection with anything you submit to us, whether or not solicited by us, you agree that creative ideas, suggestions or other materials you submit are not being made in confidence or trust and that no confidential or fiduciary relationship is intended or created between you and us in any way, and that you have no expectation of review, compensation or consideration

license you grant LeapFrog is irrevocable and perpetual.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Termination: </i>If you are dissatisfied with any portion of the LeapFrog Service, or with any of the Terms, please discontinue using the LeapFrog Services.\nWhere permitted by law, this is your sole and exclusive remedy.\nThis agreement is effective until terminated by either party.\nYou may ask us to terminate your account

notice if you fail to comply with the Terms.\nYou will be responsible for immediate payment of any outstanding charges to your account in the event of termination.</p>\n<p>\n<i>LeapFrog\u2019s Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement:</i> If you believe that any material provided through the LeapFrog Services infringes your copyright, you should notify LeapFrog of your

governed by or subject to the laws of the subject jurisdiction or to be subject to personal jurisdiction of such jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Force Majeure:</i> LeapFrog will be excused from performance under these Terms for any period when we were prevented from or delayed in performing any obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control,

remainder of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect according to its terms.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Survival:</i> Upon expiration or termination of these Terms, the rights granted to you under these Terms with respect to the LeapFrog Services or any Software (as defined under the Software License Agreement) will immediately terminate.\nHowever, LeapFrog\u2019s license to your Feedback, as well as

Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Waiver:</i> No waiver of any provision of the Terms by LeapFrog shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision.\nLeapFrog\u2019s failure to
