Note: the framed explanations aren\u2019t legally binding and are meant to help you understand the legal language.</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains how Surfshark B.V., address: Kabelweg 57, 1014BA Amsterdam, the Netherlands processes your personal data when you use our Services or interact with our Website.\nThe Privacy Policy will remain in effect until a new policy supersedes it.\nWe may choose to update this policy at our discretion, so you should check this page periodically as the terms may change from time to time.\nThe most recent version of the policy will be reflected by the \u201clast updated\u201d date noted at the bottom of the page.\nYour continued use of the Website and our Services will constitute your acknowledgment of the policy in its current version and your understanding of the terms of the policy.</p>1.\nWhat information is collected and why?<p>We\u2019re established in the Netherlands and we keep our Services logs-free.\nWe don\u2019t collect any information that could lead us to know what you\u2019re up to online.</p>\n<p>Surfshark respects your privacy, therefore we are committed to not process any information related to the online activity of our users.\nSurfshark is based in the jurisdiction, which does not require information storage or reporting.\nWe do not collect any information about what you do online (your visited IP addresses, browsing history, session information, used bandwidth, connection time stamps, network traffic or any other similar information).</p>\n<p>Our servers do store information about your connection to a particular VPN server (user ID and connection time stamps), BUT this information is automatically deleted within 15 minutes after termination of your session.\nAnd be assured that no information is stored about the websites you visit.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you visit our Website or navigate within our app (collectively referred to as \u2018Website\u2019), we collect and use some information to improve the performance of our Website.\nThe information we collect on our Website may include anonymous \u201ctraffic information\u201d provided by the host or similar provider of such information (e.g.\nGoogle Analytics) that does not personally identify you.\nThis information is statistical and includes information about which pages on Surfshark\u2019s Website visitors visit and how long visitors stay on a particular page.\nIt also provides information about what browser, network, or device is used to visit our Website.\nTo learn more about Google Analytics and how to opt out, please visit <b>https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-opt-out/fllaojicojecljbmefodhfapmkghcbnh?hl=en</b>.\nAlso, when you visit our Website, we may retain your IP address and a unique identifier of your device.\nThis helps us identify problems with our server, to administer our Website, or to display the content according to your preferences.\nThe legal basis for such processing is our legitimate interest to analyse and improve the performance of our Website and user experience.\nThat does not mean that we track your online activity while you use our Services.</li>\n</ul>When you use our Services, we collect and use the information for the following purposes:<ul>\n<li>To provide our Services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We process limited information related to the use of our Services (registration information: e-mail, account registration date, information about subscription, encrypted password, when you use our Smart DNS feature \u2013 your IP address, when you use our Search tool \u2013 aggregated number of performed searches).</p>\n<p>For provision of our antivirus service (currently available for Windows and Android users) we also collect information about your devices on which you use the antivirus service.\nThis information is needed to ensure the compliance with a limitation for the number of devices that one client may use for the antivirus service as provided in our Terms of Service.\nIf you choose to use the Webcam Protection feature, we will not have access to your webcam, microphone, apps or files on your device.\nWe will retain statistical information about the usage of this feature, including the number of times you received a request to access your camera or microphone, which preference you selected, whether this feature is turned on or off, how many apps you have included in the exclusion list.</p>\n<p>If you use our Alert service, you may enter email addresses which you would like to monitor for breaches.\nIn such case we will retain this information.\nYou may also enter your personal identity number (or social security number) and/or credit card number to monitor for related security breaches.\nWhen you choose to monitor your email address, you authorize us to look up additional information (usernames, passwords, full names, country, physical address or IP addresses) related to that email in known data breaches, which, if found, is provided to you in the platform.\nWe do not look up for such additional information when you choose to monitor your credit card or social security numbers.\nAs regards this data, we retain it in encrypted form and even we cannot use or review it.</p>\n<p>Legal basis for the processing of information is performance of a contract to which you are a party.\nPlease note that this information is necessary to enter into a contract and if you do not provide this information (or if we cannot retain this information), we will not be able to provide you with our Services.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysing and improving the performance of our Services and user experience (when you use our Services).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To maintain a perfect quality of our Services and provide you with efficient support, we collect diagnostics information and monitor crash reports on our apps and extensions.\nThe information we collect contains aggregated performance information, the frequency of use of our Services, unsuccessful connection attempts and other similar information.\nPlease note that diagnostics information does not contain uniquely identifiable information.\nHowever, if you face some problems when using our apps, to solve these problems we may require your device information.\nWe will access this information only if you provide a separate consent for that.</p>\n<p>When you permit us through a pop-up within our app, we collect your location data, i.e.\nonly your WiFi name (Service Set Identifier), which is stored on your device for the purpose of enabling \u201cAuto-connect\u201d feature, which extends to \u201cTrusted WiFi\u201d networks.\nThis feature allows our app to automatically connect to a server without your worry about it.\nHowever, please rest assured that we do not share this information to any third party.\nIn fact we do not store this information on our end and it is stored only on your device.</p>\n<p>In case we would process your personal information, legal basis for such processing is our legitimate interest to analyse and improve the performance of our Website/Services and user experience.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Offering our Services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may contact you via email for this purpose, but we also encourage you to contact us via our online contact form to get the best VPN offer for you.\nFor us to be able to address your requests effectively, we may ask you to provide some information about you.\nWe will also use the provided information to contact you regarding any future offers that may be of interest to you.</p>\n<p>If you do not wish to receive emails from us, you can opt-out from receiving emails or unsubscribe at <b>support@surfshark.com</b> or click \u201cunsubscribe\u201d at the bottom of any correspondence.\nIf you have multiple email addresses, you will need to opt-out for each address in order to be removed from our active database.</p>\n<p>Legal basis for the processing of personal information is your consent, your relationship with Surfshark or our legitimate interest to conduct marketing activities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Communicating with users and customer support.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We use user email address to: i) send important updates and announcements related to the use of our Services.\nii) respond to user requests or inquiries.\nIn addition to user email, we process your inquiry and other information that is provided by you during the conversation.</p>\n<p>When a user contacts us through a live chat on our website, we are able to see the user\u2019s IP address.\nThis information is needed to determine if the user is connected to our servers so that we can assist in solving related issues.</p>\n<p>Legal basis for the processing of personal information is performance of contract with you (in case of important communication related to our Services) or your consent (in case you submit an inquiry with our customer support).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To interact with you via social media.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where you interact with us via social media, we will process social media profile information, inquiry information, post information and other information you provide us with.</p>\n<p>Legal basis for the processing of personal information is your consent.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advertising.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may receive certain information about you (cookie id, mobile device id, when you use our Trust DNS app \u2013 advertising IDs, in app events, such as in-app purchase or amount and type of ads watched, information about what browser, network, or device is used to access and use Trust DNS) from certain advertisers and advertising partners for advertising purposes.\nOur advertising partners help us deliver more relevant ads and promotional messages to you, which may include interest-based advertising and account-based advertising.</p>\n<p>Legal basis for the processing of personal information is our legitimate interest to deliver relevant ads and promotional messages to you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accounting, payment, legal requirements and legal processes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are subject to accounting, tax and other statutory requirements.\nWe may have to protect our legitimate interests and legal rights.\nIn these cases we may be required to collect and store a limited amount of certain information: email address, subscription information, payment related information, legal documents.</p>\n<p>As for payment related information, our payment processing partners collect usual data necessary for payment processing and/or refund requests (transaction date, payer\u2019s IP address, credit card number, credit card owner\u2019s full name, in some jurisdictions also personal identity code, passport or identity card number and/or residence address).\nWe process only very small part of this payment related information (part of the credit card number, payer\u2019s IP address, payment amount, currency, date of payment and card expiry date) for solving payment related issues (such as fraud prevention cases).\nWe also collect information about your residence country (and your state) as this information is needed to calculate applicable VAT/sales tax.\nIf you elect so, we may retain your data which is used to generate and issue invoice for the rendered Services.\nIf you choose the open banking payment method to pay for our Services, we will collect your name and surname, as well as your bank details.</p>\n<p>Legal basis for the processing of personal information is a legal obligation to which we are subject (in case we need to collect your information statutorily) and our legitimate interest to defend our rights and interests (in case of other legal processes related to you, if any).</p>2.\nHow long do we store your personal information?<p>Information Retention</p>\n<p>Please keep in mind, that one of our most important principles is No-logs Policy (see more in our Terms of Service), therefore we collect only the minimum amount of information about you, which is required to provide you with our Services.</p>\n<p>We apply different retention periods depending on the purpose for which your personal information is

delete your personal information specified in Clause 1, unless, we are legally required to maintain certain personal information, including situations such as the following: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit on your account or an unresolved claim or dispute, we will retain the necessary personal information about you until the issue is resolved.\n</li>\n<li>Where we are required to retain the personal information about you for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain only the necessary personal information for the period required by applicable law.\nand/or, </li>\n<li>Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our users.</li>\n</ul>3.\nHow does our Website interact with third party services and content?<p>Information Transfers</p>\n<p>Your information from Clause 1 may travel around the world a bit, but we always take extra care to keep it safe and sound.</p>\n<p>Your information as specified in Clause 1 may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers.\nPlease note that we use standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission (you can access it <b>here</b>) to transfer your personal information from the EEA to other countries or we transfer personal information to countries that the European Commission has recognised as ensuring an adequate level of information protection (you can access the list of countries

including short blurbs of text to help you understand what each section is about.\nYou should still read the whole thing since this is only a comment and the Terms are the binding document you\u2019re agreeing to if you have a Surfshark account.\nBut we\u2019re not judging.</p>\n<p>Thank you for visiting Surfshark! Please read the following information carefully.\nPLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE PROVISIONS COVERING AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OF SERVICES AND CHANGE OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE.\nThese Terms of Service govern your access to and use of all Surfshark Services.\nThis is a binding agreement.\nIF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF SERVICE, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE WEBSITE OR OUR SERVICES.\nBY ACCESSING OR USING THE WEBSITE AND OUR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF SERVICE.\nReferences to \u2018you\u2019 in these Terms of Service indicate a person who created Surfshark account and/or whose payment method is charged.</p>\n<p>We may change these Terms of Service from time to time.\nWe will post a notice on the Surfshark Site any time these Terms of Service have been amended or updated.\nIt is your responsibility to review these Terms of Service periodically, and if at any time you find these Terms of Service unacceptable, you must immediately leave the Surfshark Site and cease all use of our Services.</p>\n<p>When you agree to use our Services, which includes, but is not limited to: the use of our servers, routers, IP addresses, protocols, add-ons, software, applications, extensions, and other equipment, as well as any updates thereof, you agree to accept these Terms.</p>1.\nWhat services does Surfshark provide?<p>A VPN, plus a bunch of other services that all have to do with privacy and security.</p>\n<p>Surfshark provides virtual private network (VPN) services, also other privacy and cyber security related services (\u201cServices\u201d).\nServices include, but are not limited to VPN and other software, extensions, applications, information and content made available to you by Surfshark.\nA VPN is a secure way to protect your online activities by encrypting your data connection.\nThus, third parties are unable to monitor your network traffic, such as websites, downloaded files, or other used internet services.\nWith Surfshark you can connect to different VPN servers worldwide to ensure the privacy of your location.</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t collect logs or any other information that\u2019d let us identify you.\nThe only things we do collect are strictly necessary to provide you with our services.\nIf you are using the Dedicated IP service, your online activities could be traced back to your account information as this IP is tied to your email address.\nHowever, you may choose using an anonymous Dedicated IP option which will result in a removal of all the information we have in our database about your Dedicated IP address.\nYou can find more details about that in the Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<b>No-logs Policy</b> is one of the most important features of our Services.\nIt means your activities are not in any way logged, retained, or transferred to third parties when you connect to our Services.\nWe do not collect any information about what you do online (your visited IP addresses, browsing history, session information, used bandwidth, connection time stamps, network traffic or any other similar data).\nWe can ensure such policy as we are based in the jurisdiction, which does not require data storage or reporting, and processes related to provision of our Services are automated.\nMoreover, only very limited user data collected from or provided by you is processed in order to provide Services to you.\nTo prevent service abuse, our servers store your user ID and/or IP address, and connection time stamps, but this information is automatically deleted within 15 minutes after termination of your session.</p>\n<p>Please note that if you use a dedicated IP address (a unique internet protocol address assigned exclusively to you), it will encrypt your internet traffic and hide your real IP address and virtual location.\nHowever, since it\u2019s tied to your email address, certain online activities can be traced back to your account information as far as you don\u2019t select an anonymous Dedicated IP option after the Dedicated IP installation process.\nAnonymous Dedicated IP option removes any information we have in our database about your Dedicated IP address.\nTherefore, after you choose this, you will have to manually set up new devices and retain your own information as we will not have any links about who and how uses your Dedicated IP address.</p>\n<p>More information on what information is collected about you and how it is used can be found in our Privacy Policy at<b> https://surfshark.com/privacy</b>\n</p>\n<p>No shady stuff, please.</p>\n<p>We do not approve any unlawful, illicit, criminal or fraudulent activities committed by using Surfshark Services.\nAs we are not logging any information about your activities, you are using the Surfshark Services at your own responsibility.\nSurfshark will not be liable in any way or form for illegal actions done by you arising through or from the use of our Services.</p>2.\nDo I have to create an account?<p>Yup.\nAnd you\u2019re responsible for it.</p>\n<p>In order to use some of the Surfshark Services, you will be asked to set up an account.\nYou are solely responsible for all usage or activity on your account including, but not limited to, use of the account by any person who uses your account, with or without authorization, or who has access to any computer on which your account resides or is accessible.</p>3.\nWhat happens if I share or lose my account information?<p>Please take care of your information.\nIf you tell us about losing it right away, we may be able to help you out.</p>\n<p>If you open an account to use or access the Services, you must complete the registration process by providing the complete and accurate information requested on the registration form.\nYou may be asked to provide an e-mail address and password.\n<b>You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password</b>.\nYou may not sell, or trade that Account to any other person.</p>\n<p>You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account, e-mail address, or password.\nWe are not liable for any loss that you or any third party incur as a result of someone else using your password, either with or without your knowledge.\nWe reserve the right to terminate your account at any time.</p>4.\nWhat is Surfshark payment, automatic renewal and refund policy?<p>To keep you secured, Surfshark Services renew automatically.\nYou can cancel automatic renewal at any time.</p>\n<p>You can subscribe to Surfshark Services on a service period basis.\nAfter signing up for Surfshark Services you may choose a payment method.\nOnly some of our Services are free of charge.</p>\n<p>Paid Surfshark Services renew automatically at the end of each service period and your chosen payment method is charged again, unless you decide to cancel your automatic payments before the automatic renewal.\nBy entering your payment details you agree with the automatic renewal.\nWe will inform you in advance by email about the automatic renewal of your subscription (if it is longer than one month).</p>\n<p>We will send the first receipt for your purchased Services to your email.\nAll later receipts will be sent to your Surfshark account (to see those receipts please log in to your account, click on \u201cMy account\u201d, select \u201cSubscriptions\u201d and then see the receipts in the \u201cInvoices &amp.\nreceipts\u201d section).</p>\n<p>Surfshark may change the price for the subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, or other subscription terms from time to time and will communicate any price or other changes to you in advance.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price and terms by continuing to use the Services after the changes take effect.\nPlease see currently applicable recurring subscription fees <b> here</b>.</p>\n<p>We can refund you on the basis of our 30-day money-back guarantee.\nExcept if you signed up via iTunes/App Store/Amazon, with a prepaid card/gift card or decided to use an anonymous Dedicated IP option.\nThese are out of our hands.</p>\n<p>Your satisfaction with our Services is our main goal.\nIf you choose not to use our paid Services anymore, we guarantee you a right to claim a refund within 30 days following your purchase of our Services.\nHowever, we would like to solve your issue before you decide to cancel the subscription, therefore you are always welcome to reach out to us at <b>support@surfshark.com</b>.\nYou can get a refund for the cancellation of our Services twice.\nIf you already have been granted a refund once, you can get the second refund if the period between both cancellations for which you claim refund is not less than 6 months.\nIf you purchase our Services again after the second refund, you will not be granted a refund for any further cancellation.\nMonthly subscriptions may be refunded on the basis of the 30-day money-back guarantee only after the initial purchase.\nOnce a monthly subscription is renewed, it cannot be refunded on the basis of the 30-day money-back guarantee.\nSurfshark reserves the right to verify the validity of your account information, and to withhold or delay any refunds until such verification is complete.</p>\n<p>As a rule, you have no right to claim a refund after the period of 30 days from the purchase has passed.\nNevertheless, in the exceptional cases, we will consider refund beyond such 30-days period, at our sole discretion, if you can demonstrate that the Services which you purchased were not available or usable and that you made reasonable attempts to contact us regarding this issue.\nIn such a case, we may provide you with a pro-rata refund of Services\u2019 fees paid during the subscription period when the Services were not available or usable.</p>\n<p>If you purchase our subscription through iTunes/App Store/Amazon \u2013 we are not able to grant you a refund, as subscriptions purchased via the iTunes/App Store/Amazon are subject to iTunes/App Store/Amazon refund policies.\nIn such a case, you would have to contact a specific store for a refund.\nSurfshark cannot refund any purchases made from our resellers.\nIn this case, refunds are handled according to the terms and conditions of the reseller from which the product was purchased.</p>\n<p>Payments made using prepaid cards or gift cards are not refunded.\nFor payments made in cryptocurrency, the equivalent amount in US Dollars is refunded in the same cryptocurrency (based on the rate of exchange at the moment of refund).</p>\n<p>You have a right to delete your account at any time, however, deleted accounts will not be refunded for the unused part of the ongoing service period.</p>\n<p>If you decide to use an anonymous Dedicated IP option which can be selected after the installation of your Dedicated IP, this will cause a removal of all the information we have in our database about your Dedicated IP address.\nTaking that into account, we will no longer be able to grant you a refund, as we will not have any possibility to establish any links between you and a particular Dedicated IP.</p>\n<p>We reserve the right not to issue refund in the event of a breach of these Terms.</p>\n<p>Any fees charged by Surfshark are exclusive of taxes.\nNevertheless, we may calculate and add taxes or duties, including, but not limited to VAT, GST and other taxes or fees under laws applicable to you at the time of purchase.</p>\n<p>All payments are being processed by our own payment processing companies (Surfshark Limited, registered at Suite 1, 3rd Floor 11-12 St.\nJames\u2019s Square, London, United Kingdom, SW1Y 4LB and Surfshark Inc., registered at 16192
