Goods.</li>\n<li>8.6 A person having the right under Section 1923 of the Civil Code is also entitled to compensation of the costs purposefully expended in exercising this right.\nHowever, if the person fails to assert the right to compensation within one month after the time limit for claiming the defect has expired, a court shall not grant that right if the Seller invokes late assertion of the right to compensation.</li>\n</ul>\n9.\nContractual Quality Warranty\n<ul>\n<li>9.1 The Seller provides the Buyer with a contractual warranty for quality only if the Buyer explicitly specifies the

obliged to make a decision on the report of defects immediately, or, in complicated cases, within 3 business days.\nThis period does not include a period of time reasonable in view of the type of
