via\nemail.</p>\n#What we collect and why\n<p>The only data we require of your account is your email address.\na username of\nyour choosing, which must be unique among all users.\nand a password.\nYour email\nand username are stored in \"plain text\".\nYour password is stored after\nprocessing with bcrypt, from which the original password cannot be devised\nwithout a computationally expensive process.\nHowever, given your password, we\ncan determine that it matches our stored key without expensive processing.\nThe\npurpose of this step is to ensure that should our database become compromised,\nyour original password will be difficult to recover.\nRegardless, you are\nstrongly encouraged to use a unique password for your sr.ht account.</p>\n<p>You may choose to give us additional information, which is shown publicly on\nthe site.\nThis includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your location</li>\n<li>A URL to any website</li>\n<li>A short biography</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may omit or provide fictitious data for this information.</p>\n<p>You may be required to provide the following information in order to\nsuccessfully operate some parts of the service, some of which may be used to\nuniquely identify you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SSH keys</li>\n<li>PGP keys</li>\n<li>Two-factor authorization keys</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may delete this information at any time by visiting your account\ndetails.\nIf you provide a PGP key, you may choose to have\nemail communications from sr.ht encrypted before being sent to you.</p>\n<p>We also obtain some information from your web browser as you use our services\nand store it for up to 30 days:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your IP address</li>\n<li>When you accessed the site</li>\n<li>What you did on the site</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This information is available to you as an audit\nlog.\nYou are not able to delete this information.\nThe purpose of this data collection is to inform both you and sr.ht of any\nunknown activity on your account.\nIf we permitted deletion of this information,\nsomeone who obtains unauthorized access to your account would be able to delete\nit, too.</p>\n<p>We also store various other kinds of information that you explicitly choose to\ngive us, including (but not limited to):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>repositories on git.sr.ht</li>\n<li>tickets on todo.sr.ht</li>\n<li>build logs and secrets on builds.sr.ht</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To faciliate automated access to your account for third-party service or your\npersonal use, we also generate and store API keys which can be used to authorize\nuse of your account.\nA portion of these keys are stored in plaintext \u2014 not\nenough to gain access to your account, but enough for us to quickly look up your\naccount details given the key.\nThe full key is stored only after processing with\nbcrypt, similar to the process used for your password.</p>\n<p>If you choose to use our paid services, we will store a token which is used to\nbill your payment method.\nInformation like your credit card number cannot be\nrecovered from this token.</p>\n<p>We also use cookies to store long-lived authorization data, to remember that\nyou're logged into your account between visits without prompting you for your\npassword again.\nWe also use cookies to store short-lived information, like the\nfact that we have to tell you on the next page you load that we completed some\noperation successfully for you.</p>\n#How we share your information with third-parties\n<p>Aside from information you choose to make public in the course of your use of\nsr.ht and information you explicitly choose to share with specific\nthird parties, none of your information is shared with third parties.\nWe do not\nembed third-party content in our website, with one exception: on the billing\npage, we embed a script from Stripe.\nThis measure is taken\nto improve your privacy and allows us to avoid directly handling your credit\ncard information.</p>\n<p>We permit user-generated content to include images from and links to third-party\nsites.\nOn pages displaying this content, information may be sent to these\nthird-parties.\nThis information includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your IP address</li>\n<li>Information about your web browser, such as whether you use Firefox or Chrome</li>\n<li>The URL on sr.ht you visited when you saw this content</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are not responsible for any additional information your web browser may send\nto these third parties.</p>\n<p>If you use any of our paid services, we will transmit your payment information\nto a third-party payment processor.\nYou will be notified of this before the\ninformation is transmitted, and given an opportunity to prevent its\ntransmission.\nWe will be unable to provide you with paid services if you decline\nto transmit this information.</p>\n<p>We may also be required to remit your data upon receiving an order from a court\nof the United States.\nIf permitted by the order, you will be notified if this\nhappens.</p>\n#How to access and control the information we've collected\n<p>You may submit a request via email to Drew DeVault sir@cmpwn.com to
