law.\n</p>\n2.\nCopyright Violations\n<p>By requesting and using a Wiki provided by Miraheze, you agree to not host any content where you do not hold the explicit permission of the copyright holder to use the content or are otherwise legally entitled to use the content.\nThis applies equally to private and public Wikis.\n</p>\n<p>In the event of unauthorised copyrighted material being found, you may report the contents to us via techmiraheze.org.\nUnder Section 96 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, the enforcement action and liability lie with the copyright holder.\nMiraheze holds no requirement to act on copyright requests except by requests of the copyright holder.\nIn the interest of protecting creative rights, Miraheze will act on complaints if it deems there to be an unreasonable or unacceptable delay in handling of non-legal requests.\n</p>\n3.\nPrivacy\n<p>You agree to read and accept Miraheze's Privacy Policy.\n</p>\n4.\nDisclaimer\n<p>The materials on

representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its Internet web site or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to this

interruption,) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on Miraheze's Internet site, even if Miraheze or a Miraheze authorised representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage.\nBecause some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.\n</p>\n6.\nRevisions and Errata\n<p>The materials appearing on Miraheze's web site could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors.\nMiraheze does not warrant that any of the materials on its web site are accurate, complete, or current.\nMiraheze or its users may make changes to the materials contained on its web site at any time without notice.\nMiraheze does not,

disseminate in the United Kingdom.\n</p>\n8.\nAccess Restrictions\n<p>Miraheze may modify, restrict, or prohibit your access to Miraheze services and Wikis at any time under Miraheze's sole discretion.\nCommon reasons include:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sending enough requests to Miraheze servers to degrade the service of others.\nor</li>\n<li>Conducting any activity on Miraheze which is illegal in the United Kingdom.\nor</li>\n<li>Excessive violation of this or other Miraheze policies;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Wikis hosted by Miraheze may modify, restrict, or prohibit your access to their respective Wikis under their respective policies.\n</p>\n9.\nHosting\n<p>This section applies to people who run or manage Wikis hosted on the Miraheze service, or have applied to do so.\nThese people are typically called \"bureaucrats\", \"sysops\", or \"administrators\", but herein refers to anyone who holds a similarly privileged role on a Wiki.\n</p>\n9a.\nProviding Service\n<p>Miraheze may, at its discretion, provide you with a Wiki with in which you can place content.\nYou agree that these Terms create no obligation to continue service for your Wiki.\nYou also understand that donation to Miraheze does not imply an in-kind contract to provide service.\nYou agree to let Miraheze personnel access your Wiki's content, change your Wiki's configuration, and remove or modify content in violation of Miraheze policy, for the purpose of providing service and subject to our Privacy Policy.\n</p>\n9b.\nContent\n<p>If you create or administrate a wiki on Miraheze, you are expected to ensure that your wiki is in compliance with the Content Policy.\nYou acknowledge that wikis that repeatedly violate this policy are subject to suspension, removal, and/or deletion by Miraheze.\n</p>\n9c.\nExtensions and Customization\n<p>As part of your service, you may request that Miraheze install additional extensions to the Mediawiki software to alter your Wiki's functionality.\nMiraheze will review the extensions to ensure that they are appropriate for our overall security and will function within our technical limits.\nMiraheze is not responsible for any data loss occurring as the result of extensions or software customization requested by users, and you agree not to hold Miraheze or its agents liable for any damages resulting in the use of these extensions.\n</p>\n<p>Any customization you make to your wiki must comply with Miraheze's Privacy Policy.\n</p>\n9d.\nTermination\n<p>If the administrative staff of a wiki wishes to leave Miraheze and terminate hosting, or if a wiki is removed from service, Miraheze will provide data dumps of a wiki's content.\nThese content archives will be maintained as long as it is legally, financially, or technically feasible to do so, at Miraheze's discretion.\nMiraheze may also permanently delete wiki content at the request of its administrators.\nYou agree that any wiki you create is subject to our Dormancy Policy, and may be deleted due to inactivity.\n</p>\n10.\nJurisdiction\n<p>Any disputes and complaints between you and Miraheze are under the exclusive jurisdiction of courts located within

wikis is granted or revoked by the creators and administrators of these wikis.\nBe aware that the wiki administrators can restrict your access to Contributions you have made on a private wiki, or even

that Miraheze can send to your browser for storage on your computer.\nCookies make using the Services easier by saving your status and preferences and refreshing them every time you use the Services.\nFor instance, Miraheze may use cookies to recognise you when you return to the Services so that you do not have to resubmit your log-in credentials.\nIn order to clear this logon information, for example if using a public terminal, you should log out of your account.\nWhile many browsers allow you to change your settings in order to refuse cookies or to be alerted when cookies are being sent, Miraheze recommends that you leave cookies enabled, as disabling cookies may prevent you from using and may interfere with some functionality of the Services.\n</p>\n<p>Cookies are not

not want to receive promotional emails from Miraheze, please visit your User Preferences page or follow the opt-out instructions contained in email messages you receive from us.\nHowever, please note that, even if you choose not to receive marketing emails from Miraheze, you will continue to receive all emails related to your use of the Services (e.g.\nthose regarding forgotten user passwords) from Miraheze.\nControls to set which emails you receive from Miraheze are in the Preferences page.\n</p>\n<p>In addition to automated messages sent by the Services, users with verified email addresses may wish to communicate with each other.\nBy default, if you have a verified email address, other users may use a Special page (\"EmailUser\") to send messages to you and vice versa.\nWhen you use EmailUser to send a message, Miraheze will send an email to the recipient of your choice which includes your email address and the content you chose to send.\nYour email address is not revealed when others contact you.\nEmailUser functionality may be enabled or disabled on the Preferences page.\n</p>\n7.\nSharing of Information with Third Parties\n<p>Generally, Miraheze does not

of these requests, please follow our Data Request Process.\n</p>\n11.\nSecurity Notifications\n<p>You have the right to be notified of any security breach at Miraheze which exposes your personal
