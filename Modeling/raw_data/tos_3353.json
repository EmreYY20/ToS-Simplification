(\"Policy\") sets out how Flight Centre Travel Group Limited (ACN 003 377 188) and its subsidiaries, related bodies corporate and franchisees worldwide, and all their brands, including but not limited to Flight Centre, Student Flights, Travel Associates, Flight Centre Business Travel, Flight Centre Sports &amp.\nEvents, Aunt Betty, BYOjet and Travel Money Oz (collectively referred to in this document as \"Flight Centre\u201d, \"we\" \"our\" or \"us\") protects the privacy of your personal information.</p>\n<p>Flight Centre is one of the world's largest travel agency groups.\nWe need to collect, use and disclose personal information in order to perform our business functions and activities, including making and managing travel bookings on behalf of our customers.\nWe are firmly committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal information and to maintaining various physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect personal information in our care.</p>\n<p>By providing personal information to us (either directly or allowing another person to do so on your behalf), you agree that this Policy will apply to how we handle your personal information and you consent to us collecting, using and disclosing your personal information as detailed in this Policy.\nIf you do not agree with any part of this Policy, you must not provide your personal information to us.\nIf you do not provide us with your personal information, or if you withdraw a consent that you have given under this Policy, this may affect our ability to provide services to you or negatively impact the services we can provide to you.\nFor example, most travel bookings must be made under the traveller's full name and must include contact details and appropriate identification (e.g.\npassport details).\nWe cannot make bookings for you without that information.</p>\n<p>There may be instances where your local data protection laws impose more restrictive information handling practices than the practices set out in this Policy.\nWhere this occurs we will adjust our information handling practices in your jurisdiction to comply with these local data protection laws.</p> 2.\nWhat personal information do we collect? <p>Personal information has the meaning given under your local data protection law.\nPersonal information generally means information which relates to a living individual who can be identified from that information, or from that information and other information in a person\u2019s possession, including any expression of opinion, whether true or not, and whether recorded in material form or not, about an identified or reasonably identifiable individual, and any indication of intention in respect of an individual.</p>\n<p>Generally, the type of personal information we collect about you is the information that is needed to facilitate your travel arrangements and bookings and to arrange travel related services and/or products on your behalf.\nFor example, we may collect details such as your name, residential/mailing address, telephone number, email address, credit/debit card details (including card type, card number, security number and expiry date), passport details, loyalty program / frequent flyer details, information about your dietary requirements and health issues (if any), and other details relevant to your travel arrangements or required by the relevant travel service provider(s) (e.g.\nairlines and accommodation or tour providers).\nWhen you make contact with us for other purposes, we may also collect personal information about you in relation to those purposes.\nFor example, we may collect your personal information so we can contact you about a competition you have entered (e.g.\nif you win) or to respond to an enquiry or feedback you have sent to us.\nWe also collect information that is required for use in the business activities of Flight Centre and our related entities, including for example, financial details necessary in order to process various transactions, video surveillance footage used for security purposes, and other relevant personal information you may elect to provide to us.</p>\n<p>In some circumstances, we may collect personal information from you which may be regarded as sensitive information under your local data protection laws.\nSensitive information may include (without limitation) your racial or ethnic origin, philosophical or religious beliefs or affiliations, sexual preferences or practices, criminal record and the alleged commission of an offence, membership of political, professional or trade associations, biometric and genetic information, passwords and financial information and health information, and (in the USA) any personal information relating to a child under the age of 13.\nWe will only collect sensitive information in compliance with your local data protection laws, with your consent and/or where it is reasonably necessary for, or directly related to, one or more of our functions or activities (e.g.\nto make travel arrangements), unless we are otherwise required or authorised to do so by law.\nTo the extent permitted or required under your local data protection laws, you consent to us using and disclosing your sensitive information for the purpose for which it was collected, unless we subsequently receive your consent to use it for another purpose.\nFor example, if you provide health information to us in connection with a travel insurance application you would like to make, you consent to us using and disclosing that health information in connection with arranging that travel insurance on your behalf.\nA further example is if you disclose your religious beliefs to us because you are interested in, for example, certain holiday packages, in which case you consent to us using and disclosing that information in connection with facilitating your request.\nWe will not use sensitive information for purposes other than those for which it was collected, unless we subsequently receive your consent to use it for another purpose.</p> 3.\nHow do we collect personal information? <p>We will collect personal information directly from you unless it is unreasonable or impracticable to do so.\nGenerally, this collection will occur when you deal with us either in person, by telephone, letter, facsimile, email, when you visit any of our websites or when you connect with us via social media.\nWe may collect personal information about you when you purchase or make enquiries about travel arrangements or other products and services.\nwhen you enter competitions or register for promotions.\nwhen you subscribe to receive marketing from us (e.g.\ne-newsletters).\nwhen you request brochures or other information from us.\nor when you provide information, or use our services, on social media.\nUnless you choose to do so under a pseudonym or anonymously, we may also collect your personal information (other than sensitive information) when you complete surveys or provide us with feedback.</p>\n<p>In some circumstances, it may be necessary for us to collect personal information about you from a third party.\nThis includes where a person makes a travel booking on your behalf which includes travel arrangements to be used by you (e.g.\na family or group booking or a travel booking made for you by your employer).\nWhere this occurs, we will rely on the authority of the person making the travel booking to act on behalf of any other traveller on the booking.\nBy providing your personal information to us, either directly or through a family member, employer or other agent or representative in connection with a travel booking or related service, you will be deemed to have consented to your personal information being collected by us and used and disclosed in accordance with this Policy.</p>\n<p>Where you make a travel booking on behalf of another person (e.g.\na family or group booking or a travel booking made for an employee), you agree you have obtained the consent of the other person for Flight Centre to collect, use and disclose the other person's personal information in accordance with this Policy and that you have otherwise made the other person aware of this Policy.</p>\n<p>You should let us know immediately if you become aware that your personal information has been provided to us by another person without your consent or if you did not obtain consent before providing another person's personal information to us.</p> 4.\nWhen we act as agent for a travel service provider <p>When we book and otherwise arrange travel related products and services for you, we usually do so as agent for or on behalf of travel service providers.\nIn this case, we usually collect personal information about you both for our internal purposes as described in this Policy, including the purpose of us processing your booking, and for the travel service provider for whom we act as agent for their internal purposes (e.g.\nto provide you with the booked services).\nAs an agent, all bookings are made on your behalf subject to the terms and conditions, including privacy policy, imposed by these travel service providers.\nWe will provide you with copies of all relevant travel service provider terms, conditions and privacy policies on request.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, you are deemed to consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information by us to the relevant travel service providers, and the use and disclosure of your personal information by the relevant travel service providers, for the purposes set out in this Policy and, to the extent permitted under your local data protection laws, for other purposes specified in their privacy policy.\nFor example, if you book a flight through us, then under this Policy you consent to us collecting your personal information and disclosing that information to the airline to enable your flight to be booked and for the airline to provide the flight service to you, and, to the extent permitted under your local data protection laws, for other purposes specified in their privacy policy.</p>\n<p>We act as agent for or on behalf of many thousands of travel service providers around the world, so it is not possible for us to set out in this Policy all of the travel service providers for whom we act or their locations.\nFor more information about the disclosure of personal information to travel service providers located overseas, please refer to the section below titled \u201cIs personal information transferred overseas\u201d.</p>\n<p>If you have any concerns regarding the transfer of your personal information to a travel service provider, or you wish to contact us for further information, please refer to the \u201cFeedback / Complaints / Contact\u201d section below.</p> 5.\nHow do we use and disclose your

advice and/or to assist you with booking travel and/or travel related products and services.\nHowever, the purpose for collection may differ depending on the particular circumstances as disclosed in this Policy (e.g.\ncollection of your personal information for the purpose of your participation in a competition, provision of feedback, etc).</p>\n<p>By continuing to use our services and/or by

months validity from the date of return and some countries require a machine-readable passport.\nFor international travel bookings, you must let us know if you have less than 6 months validity on your passport or if you do not have a machine-readable passport.\nWhen assisting with an international travel booking, we will assume that all travellers on the booking have a valid Australian passport which is valid for the relevant destination and transit point.\nIf this is not the case, you must let us know.\nIt is important that you ensure that you have valid passports, visas and re-entry permits which meet the requirements of immigration and other government authorities.\nAny fines, penalties, payments or expenditures incurred as a result of such documents not meeting the requirements of those authorities will be your sole responsibility (except to the extent caused by fault on our part).\nIf you need information regarding visas, passports and other travel document requirements for your trip, please let your consultant know or, for online bookings, contact us on 133 133.\nWe can provide you with general information only on visa and passport requirements that apply to international travel bookings you make with us.\nOur consultants can also obtain more specific information from an external visa advisory service provider on your behalf (if you wish, we can assist you to obtain visas through this external service and fees will apply).\nFor online bookings, you can contact an external visa provider such as Visa Central (http://au.visacentral.com/109501) directly.\nWe do not warrant the accuracy or suitability of information provided by any external service provider and accept no liability for any loss or damage which you may suffer in reliance on it (except to the extent caused by fault on our part).<br>\n<br>\n<b>If you are travelling to the United States</b> please see https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov for important information regarding compulsory pre-registration for their visa waiver program (\u201cESTA\u201d).\nAustralian passport holders will not be able to enter the United States without a valid ESTA (or visa).\nPlease note, you may not meet the eligibility requirements of ESTA and may be required to obtain a visa.<br>\n<br>\n<b>If you are travelling to Canada</b> please see http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/eta.asp for important information regarding compulsory electronic travel authorization for visa-exempt foreign nationals (\u201cETA\u201d).\nAustralian passport holders will not be able to enter Canada without a valid ETA (or visa or permit) from 15 March 2016.\nPlease note, you may not meet the eligibility requirements of ETA and may be required to obtain a visa or permit.<br>\n<br>We urge you to apply for an ESTA or ETA prior to booking an airfare if you have any concerns about whether or not you might be eligible for an ESTA or ETA.</p> 2.\nTravel Documents <p>Travel documents include (without limitation) airline tickets, hotel vouchers, tour vouchers or any other document (whether in electronic form or otherwise) used to confirm an arrangement with a travel service provider.\nTravel documents may be subject to certain conditions and/or restrictions including (without limitation) being non-refundable, non-date-changeable, and/or subject to cancellation and/or other change fees.\nTravel documents cannot be transferred to another person to use.\nAll airline tickets must be issued in the name of the passport/photo identity holder.\nYour name on your passport, visa and other travel documents must all be identical.\nAn incorrect name on a booking may result in an inability to use that booking, the booking being cancelled, and the application of additional change and/or cancellation

including COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Guidance <p>We recommend that you contact the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (\u201cDFAT\u201d) or visit their website at https://www.smartraveller.gov.au for general travel advice, as well as specific advice (including safety alert levels) relating to the destination you wish to visit.\nYou can also register your travel plans with DFAT, so that you may be more easily contacted in an emergency.<br>\n<br>We strongly recommend that you familiarise yourself with the current status and updates to Australia's immigration and border arrangements during the COVID-19 outbreak, available at https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au.<br>\n<br>In addition you should familiarise yourself with airline requirements around passenger safety, including the requirement for face masks and the need to produce evidence meeting airline and border control requirements in relation to a negative COVID-19 test both for transit and final destination passengers.\nThis information is subject to change without notice so we recommend you update yourself in relation to the relevant airline and government policies for your transit and final destination at each of (i) the time of booking, (ii) as you approach your travel date, and (iii) immediately before travel.<br>\n<br>You acknowledge that you are choosing to travel at a time where you may be exposed to the Coronavirus.\nIt is your own responsibility to acquaint yourself with all relevant travel information, including applicable health risks.\nYou acknowledge that your decision to travel is made based on your own consideration of this information, and you acknowledge and agree that you are aware of, and assume responsibility for, the risks associated with traveling at this time.\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, we accept no liability in relation to these additional risks.</p> 6.\nHealth <p>You must ensure that you are aware of any health requirements and recommended precautions relevant to your travel booking and ensure that you carry all necessary vaccination documentation.\nIn some cases, failure to present required vaccination documentation (e.g.\nproof of Yellow Fever vaccination)

prices.</p> 8.\nFinancial Arrangements <p>We receive remuneration through commissions, financial incentives and other means (together, \u201cfinancial arrangements\u201d) from booking travel and travel-related products and services on your behalf with third party travel service providers.\nWe are not required by law to disclose the nature or value of these financial arrangements.</p> 9.\nDeposit and Final Payment (Not applicable to online bookings, which must be paid in full at the time of booking) <p>You will be required to pay a deposit or deposits when booking.\nYour consultant will advise you of how much that will be.\nSubject to your rights under the Australian Consumer Law, all deposits are non-refundable for changes of mind or cancellations by you, or if the travel

to you, as well as processing and managing the changes to, or cancellation of, your booking.<br>\n<br>If you wish to change or cancel a booking that has been booked online and paid for using PayPal, you must contact our Online Customer Service Team on 1300 733 867.\nAny fees for such change or cancellation must be made via credit card and will attract the applicable credit card surcharge.<br>\n<br>All bookings are made on your behalf subject to the terms and conditions imposed by the travel service provider.\nIf, for example, a travel service provider\u2019s terms and conditions contain a \u201cno refund policy\u201d, we will only be able to provide you with the remedy provided by the travel service provider (if any), which may include a travel credit supplied by

booking is changed for any reason and when tickets or documents are re-issued.\nWhere we incur any liability for a travel service provider change or cancellation fee for any booking which is changed or cancelled for any reason, you agree to indemnify us for the amount of that fee.\nWhere you seek a refund for a changed or cancelled booking for which payment has been made to the travel service provider, we will not provide a refund to you until we receive the funds from that travel service provider (which may take 12 weeks, or longer, dependent upon the supplier processing time).\nIn the

possible.\nAll changes will be subject to any applicable travel service provider fees and Flight Centre change fees set out above, and you will be responsible for any increase in pricing that may occur as a result of your change request.<br>\n<br>If you cancel any aspect of your booking, you will forfeit your deposit and you will be required to pay any applicable travel service provider fees and Flight Centre cancellation fees set out above, and we will provide you with a refund for the remaining funds (if any).\nAlternatively, Flight Centre or the travel service provider may offer you a travel credit for the full amount paid by you without applying any applicable travel service provider fees or Flight Centre cancellation fees.\nIf your deposit or booking is refundable, this is subject to Flight Centre having received the funds from the travel service provider and/or being authorised by the travel service provider to refund your deposit or booking funds.<br>\n<br>For instant purchase or non-refundable bookings, if you cancel any aspect of your booking, you will not be entitled to a refund, travel credit or other remedy from the travel service provider and/or Flight

alternative travel arrangements of comparable standard if available (and will refund any price difference if the alternative is of a lower value), or a travel credit for the full amount paid by you.\nAlternatively, subject to the travel service provider\u2019s change or cancellation policy, the travel service provider may offer you a refund of all money paid by you in respect of the booking, from which the travel service provider and/or Flight Centre will deduct any unrecoverable costs, and any applicable travel service provider fees and Flight Centre cancellation fees set out above.<br>\n<br>\u201cUnrecoverable costs\u201d means all reasonable, direct and indirect costs we have incurred in relation to your booking, and includes amounts paid by Flight Centre to other

policy, you may not be entitled to a refund, travel credit or other remedy from the travel service provider and/or Flight Centre.</p> 14.\nUnavoidable or Extraordinary Circumstances <p>In the event of

payments) and that person will bind all such travellers to these Booking Terms and Conditions.\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>BROCHURE</strong>: This brochure was submitted for online publication on 13 Sep 2021.\nWhile Flight Centre has exercised reasonable care and skill to ensure that the content of this brochure is correct, accurate and up-to-date at the time of publication, please note that the content of this brochure is based on information supplied to us by third-party suppliers, and we do not have, and cannot be reasonably expected to have, personal knowledge about all of the facilities

&amp.\nOMISSIONS</strong>: While every effort is made to ensure the accuracy and currency of the information in the brochures, errors or omissions may occur.\nFlight Centre disclaims all liability to

your agent for all up-to-date corrections, including prices and inclusions.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>\n<strong>AGENCY</strong>: We act as an agent for, and sell various travel related products as agent on behalf of, numerous transport, accommodation and other service providers, such as airlines, coach, rail and cruise line operators, as well as all of our wholesalers.\nAny booking, advisory and other services (such as processing a change or cancellation with the relevant travel services provider) that we provide to you are collateral to that agency relationship.\nOur obligation to you is to (and you expressly authorise us to) provide booking and advisory services, including making travel bookings on your behalf and arranging relevant contracts between you and travel service providers.\nWe exercise care in the selection of reputable travel service providers, but we are not ourselves a provider of travel services and have no control over, or liability for, the services provided by third parties.\nAll bookings are made on your behalf subject to the terms and conditions, including conditions of carriage, cancellations policy and limitations of liability, imposed by these travel service providers.\nWe can provide you with copies of the relevant travel service provider terms and conditions on request.\nYour legal rights in connection with the provision of travel services are against the specific travel service provider and, except to the extent a problem is caused by fault on our part, are not against us.\nSpecifically, if for any reason (excluding fault on our part) any travel service provider is unable to provide the services for which you have contracted, your rights are against that provider and not against us.\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>LIABILITY</strong>: To the extent permitted by law, neither Flight Centre nor any of its related bodies corporate, directors, officers, employees, servants or agents accept any liability in contract, tort or otherwise for any injury, damage, loss (including consequential loss), delay, additional expense or inconvenience caused directly or indirectly by the acts, omissions or default, whether negligent or otherwise, of third party providers over whom we have no direct control, force majeure or any other event which is beyond our control or which is not preventable by reasonable diligence on our part.\nOur liability will also be limited to the extent that any relevant international conventions, for example the Montreal Convention in respect of travel by air, the Athens Convention in respect of travel by sea, the Berne Convention in respect of travel by rail and the Paris Convention in respect of the provision of accommodation, limit the amount of compensation which can be claimed for death, injury, or delay to passengers and loss, damage and delay to luggage.\nUnder circumstances where our liability cannot be excluded and where liability may be lawfully limited, such liability is limited to the remedies required of us under applicable law (including the Australian Consumer Law).\nThis liability clause is subject to your rights under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in these Booking Terms and Conditions is intended to limit any rights you may have under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth).\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>TRAVEL DOCUMENTS</strong>: Travel documents include (without limitation) airline tickets, hotel vouchers, tour vouchers or any other document (whether in electronic form or otherwise) used to confirm an arrangement with a travel service provider.\nTravel documents may be subject to certain conditions and/or restrictions including (without limitation) being non-refundable, non-date-changeable, and/or subject to cancellation and/or other change fees.\nTravel documents cannot be transferred to another person to use.\nAll airline tickets must be issued in the name of the passport/photo identity holder.\nYour name on your passport, visa and other travel documents must all be identical.\nAn incorrect name on a booking may result in an inability to use that booking, the booking being cancelled, and the application of additional change and/or cancellation fees.\nPlease review your travel documentation carefully and advise us immediately of any errors in names, dates or timings.\nIf you have booked with a consultant, it is your responsibility to collect all travel documents from us prior to travel.\nAs a general rule your travel documents will be available for collection 2 weeks prior to your departure date, however this will depend on your individual arrangements.\nPlease contact your consultant to confirm when your travel documents will be ready for collection.\nIf you have booked online, you should retain your electronic record or you should print out and retain your travel documents as provided to you by our website (or in a follow up email we send you).\nPlease ensure you retain the most up-to-date

allows it) can be expensive and is your responsibility.\nWe will not be liable for any expenses, fees, penalties, costs, liabilities, damages or losses associated with baggage allowances and excess baggage.\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>TRAVEL INSURANCE</strong>: We strongly recommend that you take out appropriate travel insurance to cover your travel arrangements.\nYour insurance protection should
