and accessibility.\nIn order to develop our services, we may, for example, conduct surveys and research related to Yle services and content concerning, among other things, habits or interests related to the use of the content.\nThese surveys can be conducted, for example, by e-mail or on our website.\nIn order to develop our operations and content, we also use the information provided as customer

data can also be used to respond to a user's requests and questions, for example, if the user has contacted our customer service.\nWe may also contact users in matters related to customer service or our services.</p>\n<p>Calls to Yle customer service are directed to an answering service at certain hours of the day, where the calls are recorded for later response.\nCalls recorded in the answering service are converted into text to speed up customer service.</p>\n<p>Calls to Yle's switchboard will also be recorded to improve customer service.</p>5.\nOther uses<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Information is also processed to ensure data security and to prevent the misuse of services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Providing various polls and competitions requires the processing of personal data.\nFor these purposes, we

processing personal data?<p>Yle will only process personal data when there is a legal basis.\nThe legal basis for processing personal data depends on the nature and purpose of the processing.</p>\n<p>One legal basis is <strong>a contract between a user and Yle</strong>.\nOnce you have created an Yle ID, we will process your user data for the purpose of providing the service.</p>\n<p>In some cases, the legal basis may be <strong>user consent</strong>.\nWe process your data in some services when you give your consent for the processing.\nFor example, this type of processing includes participating in audience competitions, subscribing to recommendation messages and location information processing in mobile applications.\nData processing based on consent is always voluntary and you may revoke your consent at will.</p>\n<p>In addition, we may process personal data for <strong>an appropriate need, i.e.\na legitimate interest in Yle</strong>.</p>\n<p>We process the data for the following purposes based on a legitimate interest.\nThese include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>the development of services and content</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>communicating about our services and content</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>compiling statistics on and analysing content use</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the personalisation of services.\nYou can learn more about recommendations used in Yle services in this article (in Finnish).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Technical development of services and ensuring service functionality</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ensuring the security of Yle and its customers, preventing the misuse of services and protecting Yle property</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Monitoring the requirements set by copyright regulations</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Customer communications, customer feedback processing and customer relationship management.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When we process personal data based on a legitimate interest, we carefully review the necessity and proportionality of the processing.</p>\n<p>Yle's archived content and related author information are processed for archiving purposes in the public interest.\nRead more about Yle\u2019s operating principles (in Finnish).</p>Will the data be shared with any third parties?<p>We will only disclose information to parties outside Yle in the following situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>With your consent, we may disclose personal data to Yle partners in conjunction with service use.</em> Personal data may be disclosed with your express consent to, for instance, a service provided by a non-Yle party.\nOne such service is the Varaamo reservation service provided by the City of Helsinki that you may use with your Yle ID.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Disclosures to our social media partners.</em> Personal data may be disclosed to social media partners such as Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, Spotify and Instagram.\nUse of social media widgets at Yle has been further described in the Yle cookie policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Disclosure of personal data for research.</em> Any disclosures of data for research use are always assessed on a case-by-case basis.\nIn principle, the information is only disclosed in a format from which individual persons can no longer be identified.\nCookie information related to audience measurement can be disclosed for statistical and research purposes.\nWe describe the processing of audience measurement data in more detail in our cookie policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>We disclose personal data to the authorities only to the extent required by mandatory legislation.</em>Personal data may be disclosed to competent authorities upon demand in accordance with statutory requirements.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Disclosure of personal data related to content author information.</em> Yle stores author information in its contents in Wikidata in order to give its content a keyword to the extent that it is considered relevant from the perspective of communication.\nThe content metadata, including author information, has been selectively published on the El\u00e4v\u00e4 arkisto website and on the opendata website in accordance with the principles of open data.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>Who processes your personal data?<p>At Yle, personal data is only processed by persons who are entitled to do so as part of their job.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Use of subcontractors</em>\n</p>\n<p>Yle may use subcontractors and service providers for the technical maintenance of its services, customer service, the administration and analysis of user information, surveys, customer communications or the implementation of various campaigns.\nYle's subcontractors and service providers process personal data only to the extent necessary for the purposes described in this privacy statement.</p>\n<p>Service providers may not use your data for any purposes other than those specified by Yle, as described in this privacy statement and any service-specific privacy statement.\nYle requires subcontractors to process personal data in a confidential manner and to ensure an adequate level of information security in order to protect personal data.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Yle applications on third-party application platforms</em>\n</p>\n<p>Personal data is collected whenever Yle applications are used.\nYle services may be offered on various device platforms, and the services may include links or access to the websites or services of other parties.\nWhen Yle services are used on, for example, a smart TV, mobile device, or a third-party application, the individual and independent privacy policies and terms of use of that service provider shall apply in addition to this privacy statement.\nApplications downloaded through the App Store, such as Apple App Store or Google Play, are also subject to the terms of use of that service provider.\nWe recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies and terms and conditions of such external parties.\nYle is not responsible for the privacy policies or terms and conditions of external parties.</p>Is data processed outside the EU or the EEA?<p>We seek to primarily provide services and process your personal data using operators and services located within EU or EEA countries.\nIn some cases, operators, services and servers located elsewhere may also be used to provide our services.\nIn these cases, your personal data may be transferred outside the EU or the EEA to a country where the regulations on the processing of personal data differ from the requirements of the Finnish legislation.\nFor example, we use the standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission to implement these transfers in compliance with statutory requirements, which ensures that personal data is adequately protected.\nWe see to it that personal data is processed in accordance with this privacy statement, regardless of where the processing takes place.</p>What do we do to protect your personal data?<p>We pay particular attention to data protection and information security in the design, implementation and maintenance of our services.\nWe use appropriate physical, technical and administrative security measures to protect your personal data.\nPersons have been specifically appointed to take care of privacy protection and information security.\nWe restrict access to systems and databases containing personal data to the appointed persons who have an essential work-related need and the right to process the personal data in question.</p>\n<p>We implement data protection and information security requirements by using, among other things, preventive risk management measures, by taking privacy protection and information security into account in the design of our services, by training our personnel and by regularly reviewing the compliance of our services with regard to data protection legislation.</p>\n<p>We aim to pseudonymise data whenever possible.\nInformation observed and derived during the use of services is stored in a format that makes it impossible to identify an individual user.</p>\n<p>You are able to personally manage the personal data, choices and consent included in your Yle ID.\nWe recommend that you review your information from time to time.\nMost of Yle's services may be used without registering an account or by using a pseudonym.</p>How do we use cookies?<p>Yle uses cookies, web beacons and other similar methods to provide and develop Yle's websites and services and personalise content.\nOur pages may also include other components from parties outside Yle that are related to, for example, social networking services.</p>\n<p>Our cookie policies describe our use of cookies in more detail and explain how you can restrict their use.</p>How long do we store your data?<p>We store your data according to applicable legislation and only for as long as is necessary for the purposes defined in this privacy statement.<br>How long personal data is stored for varies by service and depends on the nature of the information.\nWe regularly review the necessary duration of information storage.\nWe currently use the following storage periods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We will delete the details of a single Yle ID when that ID has not been used for two years.\nBefore deleting the account, we send a reminder message to the user.\nYou may also delete your Yle ID at any time.\nIn this case, we will delete your personal data related to the Yle ID within 72 hours.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Interests, favourites and playlists set by the user will be stored until the user removes the content selection in the Yle service or when that ID is deleted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Data related to the use of the services, such as viewing history, will be retained for 52 months after the data has been collected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Information related to sweepstakes and competitions will be deleted as soon as the sweepstake or competition has ended.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As a rule, customer feedback and similar contacts are kept for one year after receiving the contact.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Information on calls received by our switchboard and records of discussions with the switchboard operators are deleted 21 days after the call.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Customer service voicemail data is kept for a maximum of 90 days.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the storage period is up, we destroy the information or convert them into an anonymous format that prevents the identification of an individual person.</p>\n<p>Please note that some Yle services may include public comment sections or discussion forums.\nYour pseudonym and the content you have published may remain available even after your Yle ID has been deleted.</p>How do you exercise the rights granted to you by data protection legislation?<p>Users of an Yle service have the right</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To access their own data.\nIndividuals have the
