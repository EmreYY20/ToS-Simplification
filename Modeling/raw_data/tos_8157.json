and iRobot, we want to provide you with a resolution that is efficient and cost effective by using our customer service team.\nAlmost all customer service disputes can be resolved to the customer\u2019s satisfaction by contacting our customer service by email at global.irobot.com or by phone at 1.800.727.9077.\nIf your dispute cannot be resolved using our customer service team, these Terms describe how we shall proceed with the resolution of the dispute.</p>\n<p>AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES</p>\n<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY \u2013 IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS.&nbsp.\nARBITRATION IS A WAIVER OF THE RIGHT TO BRING SUIT IN COURT.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>THIS SECTION CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</p>\n<p>IF YOU ARE A U.S.\nRESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:</p>\n<p>WE BOTH AGREE TO ARBITRATE:&nbsp.\nYou and iRobot agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms through final and binding arbitration, except that, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate iRobot\u2019s intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights).&nbsp.\nUnder such circumstances iRobot may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Site, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.\n</p>\n<p>WHAT IS ARBITRATION: Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly.\nInstead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can.\nThus, you agree that you are waiving your right to sue or go to court to secure relief, and instead agree to the arbitration process as stated in this provision.\nIf any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced.\n</p>\n<p>ARBITRATION PROCEDURES: The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision.\nArbitration shall be initiated through JAMS.&nbsp.\nAny dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures.&nbsp.\nIf there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in this Agreement to Arbitrate, the rules set forth in this Agreement to Arbitrate will govern.\nThe JAMS Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available from JAMS at http://www.jamsadr.com or 1-800-352-5267.&nbsp.\nTo initiate arbitration, you or iRobot must do the following things:</p>\n<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nWrite a demand for Arbitration.\nThe demand must include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered.\nYou can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com.\n</p>\n<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nSend three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to your local JAMS office.</p>\n<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nSend one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party.</p>\n<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules, except that for claims of less than $1,000, you will be obligated to pay $25 and iRobot will pay all other administrative costs and fees.\nIn addition, for claims of less than $1,000, iRobot will reimburse you for the $25 fee if the arbitrator rules in your favor.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nArbitration under this agreement shall be held in the United States county where you live or work, New Jersey, or any other location we mutually agree to, subject to New Jersey law.&nbsp.\nThe arbitration may award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive relief).\nAny judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>AUTHORITY OF ARBITRATOR: The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and iRobot, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.\nThe arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.\nThe arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and the Terms.\nThe arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.\nThe arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.\nThe award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and iRobot.&nbsp.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision may be entered as a judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>NO CLASS ACTIONS: You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action.\nClass arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.</p>\n<p>WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL: THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration.\nArbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.\nIn the event any litigation should arise between you and iRobot in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND IROBOT WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.</p>\n<p>OPT-OUT OF AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE: You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing iRobot at webmaster@iRobot.com and providing the requested information as follows: (1)Your Name.\n(2) the URL of Terms of Use and Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes.\n(3) Your Address.\n(4) Your Phone Number.\n(5) and clear statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision in the Terms of Use.&nbsp.\nThe Opt-Out Notice must be emailed no later than 30 days after the date you first accept the Terms of Use by using the website.</p>\n<p>Choice of Law/Forum Selection.\nIn any circumstances where the Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes permits the parties to litigate in court, these Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Massachusetts, excluding its conflict of law rules.\nYou further expressly consent and agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of a state court of competent jurisdiction located in Massachusetts or federal court of competent jurisdiction in the District Court of Massachusetts.\n</p>\n<p>Severability.&nbsp.\nThe provisions of these Terms of Use are intended to be interpreted in a manner which makes them valid, legal, and enforceable.\nIn the event any provision of the provisions are found to be partially or wholly invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such provisions shall be modified or restricted to the extent and in the manner necessary to render them valid, legal, and enforceable.\nIt is expressly understood and agreed between the parties that such modification or restriction may be accomplished unilaterally by us, or alternatively, by disposition of a court of law or arbitrator.\nIf such provisions cannot under any circumstances be so modified or restricted, they shall be excised from the Terms of Use without affecting the validity, legality or enforceability of any of the remaining provisions.</p>\n<p>Additional Assistance.\nIf you do not understand any of the foregoing Terms and Conditions or if you have any questions or comments, we invite you to contact our Customer Service Department by email at global.irobot.com or by phone at 1.800.727.9077.</p>\n<p>For more information on User Generated Content Terms of Use,
