maintaining the trust of our customers, business partners, employees and others who share their personal information with us.\nWe are committed to using your personal data for necessary business purposes lawfully, fairly and transparently while ensuring that appropriate security measures are applied to protect the integrity and confidentiality of your personal data.</em>\n</p>\n<strong>Overview of how we handle personal data</strong>\n<p>The term \u201cpersonal data\u201d refers to any data we collect about you or you give to us to identify you in the course of our relationship, whether you are a customer, a supplier, an employee, an investor, or candidate applying for a job with us.\nExamples of the personal data include your name, e-mail address, postal address, phone number, business contact details, employment history, qualifications and related information about a job application (e.g., CV information, location and interests), and payment information depending on the context in which you share such information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We only handle the personal data you provide to us and we will let you know what personal data we hold whenever you ask.</li>\n<li>When you share your personal data with us, we will not share it with outside entities without informing you, unless we are required to do so by local laws.</li>\n<li>We only handle your personal data when we need to, such as when processing your application, when you want to buy our products, or when we want to purchase something from you.\nIf you are an investor, we only use the data you have given us to provide you with the information you have requested.</li>\n<li>We will not retain your data for longer than necessary.\nOnce your data is no longer needed, we delete it as part of our regular practices.</li>\n<li>If you would like us to update or delete your personal data, please let us know.\nWe will do our best to handle your request in a timely manner.\nPlease understand, however, that we may be legally required to maintain certain information, which we will of course always maintain as confidential.</li>\n<li>Your personal data will only be used to satisfy

your payment information, we will get your approval before doing so.</li>\n<li>Due to the sensitivity of our products, markets and customers, background checks may be periodically needed.\nThey are undertaken only by approved partners, and we will let you know when one is required.</li>\n<li>Where regulations require, we verify clearance against European External Action Service, United States Department of Commerce Denied Persons screening, and as required by local laws or specific industry requirements.</li>\n<li>We&nbsp;<u>do not sell your personal information</u>.\nWe also do not permit other companies that process your data on our behalf to sell your personal information or use it in a manner that was not specifically requested by us.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Overview of security policies</strong>\n<p>It is our responsibility to handle your personal data with care, and we have policies and technology in place designed to protect individuals\u2019 personal data.\n&nbsp;Our objective is to make your data available only to people who need to have access to it.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\nConsistent with this, we have security processes in place to identify potential inconsistencies in the handling of personal, confidential, and proprietary data, including continuous review of logs, emails, and security files from our computerized systems.\n&nbsp;Log, email, and security files are used to confirm your data goes to approved locations.\n&nbsp;When appropriate, we will involve approved third-party professionals or data security experts to assist in the maintenance of these systems.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\nFor specialized data-related processes, we only use approved suppliers who have been selected for their ability to complete the assigned work securely and safely.\n&nbsp;We hold these suppliers to the same standards to which we hold ourselves and we maintain records of their processing activities.</p>\n<p>\n<u>One such specialized process is email security.\n&nbsp;All internet messages are filtered automatically for spam, viruses, and offensive terms by third-party service providers before reaching us.\nAs such, emails may travel across international borders and be stored in cloud-based servers for some of our operations.\nWe do not accept encrypted email messages, as we cannot determine if they are safe for our operations.</u>\n</p>\n<p>At&nbsp;all times, we respect our obligations towards and agreements with you, our business partners, and the local authorities.\nWhen there appears to be a conflict between our obligations and agreements we will let you
