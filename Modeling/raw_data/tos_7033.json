<p>Manyland is proud to have people from all walks of life and all colors of the rainbow.\nRespect is one of our building blocks.\nWe strive for a peaceful environment for everyone.</p>\n<p>Try to be a good citizen and respect the creations of others when they're good, or improve them when they're not.\nYou can upvote others when you find they do good, and flag-report them if you find they do something against the terms or etiquette.\nYou can also temporarily or permanently area-lock them as editor of an area.\nYou can also report offensive things in the world by right-clicking them, then clicking the flag that shows up.\nYour voice and action matter a lot: upvoting, flagging, helping and guiding, uncluttering and many other things are our powers to maintain and shape this universe for good!\n</p>\n<p>When interacting with others, please be respectful.\nFor instance, killing others around you (unless it's part of a voluntary game amongst friends), cursing at them or otherwise showing hate against them, is against the etiquette.\nCluttering, littering, impersonation to confuse, deceptive creations outside of voluntary challenges, mass tagging, carelessness in mass removing of structures by others, bullying, strong rudeness in speech or drawings, trolling, spamming, picking of fights, personal attacks, spreading rumors about someone, overly aggressive behavior towards others, homophobia, transphobia, racism, trapping or tricking into doors in the elsewhere region, brigading, flooding with speech or actions, are against the etiquette and thus the terms.\nYou may not reserve area names for future use, or mass create new areas, as everyone should get a chance at the names.\nPlease do not create pixel-by-pixel copies of existing external artwork (unless you can be sure e.g.\nfair use or public domain rules cover it).\nIf someone doesn't want to participate in something you planned, like a game, try to find like-minded people elsewhere in the world, as there's enough space for everyone in Manyland.\nPlease do not publicize videos or screenshots of Manyland with the intention to embarass or ridicule the person being filmed\n(depending on context, you can also let others know you're recording...\nthe more it's not a group situation, the more expectation one would have to privacy).\n</p>\n<p>Often, location matters: what people may consider offensive in one area may be accepted, funny and terrific in another more distant location with another group.\nTry to apply common sense and find the group and location that's right for you and enjoy! Please note area locks from editor-based created areas are mostly under the discretion of\narea editors, whereas spawn area locks should be based on violations of the global etiquette and terms as outlined here.\nCommunication, upvoting and flagging is the basis for how we all self-maintain and this will keep your stats in great shape.</p>\n<p>Please note the current welcome points are a special case as far as structures are concerned, as we often clean up together there to give new arrivals a chance to experiment, with some \"free air\" around.</p>\n<p>Please note that it is against the etiquette to post issues specifically related to an account, or one person, on general Writables\n(or Readables, or really any other public place).\nAccount-related issues need to be either discussed in person, or if that's not possible,\ndiscussed in private with us via email.\nThis helps the privacy of all involved.</p>\n<p>Please read the terms below for more.</p> What are the terms of service? <p>We try to keep the terms text short :)</p>\n<p>\n<strong>First of all, we take our responsibility very seriously, and\nwant to provide a long-term sustainable environment for everyone who joined.</strong> If you join Manyland, you agree to all of these terms of service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Manyland requires you to be at least 13 years of age, and in some countries older</strong>: See Google's terms and age requirements and Facebook's age requirements for the US requirements and those of other countries.\nLogging in to Manyland is only possible via either a Google account or a Facebook account, so their respective terms and restrictions apply if you join Manyland, too.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Note we never automatically post to your wall or connect your friends and such when you login with Google or Facebook.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We try to have the world be stable &amp.\npermanent and have backups and such...\nbut can make no guarantees regarding lost data or availablility of the service.\nWe may block users who we find abuse the service, and cancel, remove or block accounts, creations or areas if they go against the etiquette or terms.\nWe may send out emails, but there will be an easy unsubscribe-forever-from-all-emails link with them.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We want the best for Manyland and its citizens</strong>, and to that end reserve the right to amend the world and its rules in any ways we think helps create the best place for all citizens.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>By submitting content here you affirm that you have the necessary licenses, rights, trademarks etc.\non that content</strong>\nand that you give Manyland the universe-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free right to do anything with it for all time, and\nto give all Manyzens the universe-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free rights to access this content\n(community happiness is our <em>top</em> priority to which all other decisions follow).\nOtherwise you are not allowed to use trademarked properties (including in created area names or Multi names) or copy work.\n(Non-terms sidenote: We personally wish the world would switch to movements like Creative Commons and vastly broaden Fair Use and remixing defense in everyday creative situations.)

non-logged-in explorers (including brain-equipped explorers or bots of any sort) when your main account is banned or an explorer of yours got banned within the last 30 days.\nImporting of graphics via Changers or other means is against the terms.\nClient-side code manipulation is against the terms.\nIf you discover a security vulnerability or any type of bug that can be abused, it's against the terms to keep using the bug (please just let us know about it via email, it's very much appreciated).\n</p>\n<p>It's against the terms to submit untrue or nonsensical flag reports.\nArea name squatting is against the terms.\nStalking \u2013 obsessing over another Manyzen for a longer period of time even after they told you to stop, in a way that makes the other person feel threatened and
