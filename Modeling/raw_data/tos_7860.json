Treace Products are contained on the Websites, including in any descriptions, explanations, FAQs, brochures, webinars, archives, blogs, news, or studies of Treace Products, may or may not be paid consultants of Treace.\nThe inclusion of a testimonial or story on the Websites is not an endorsement, recommendation, or prediction from Treace that you will obtain any particular outcome.\nYour results from Lapiplasty<sup>\u00ae</sup> may differ from the results portrayed in patient testimonials and/or stories contained on the Websites.\nTreace is not responsible, and will not be liable, to you or others for any decision you make, or action you take, in reliance on the information obtained from the Websites.\nYour decision to undergo surgery with the Lapiplasty<sup>\u00ae</sup> Procedure

Procedure.\nThe underlying database may not include all physicians that use, or have used, Treace Products.\nListed surgeons have performed at least 2 Lapiplasty<sup>\u00ae</sup> procedures in the

may not be paid consultants of Treace.\nTreace is not recommending that you utilize any particular surgeon, and you should make an independent determination regarding the qualifications and suitability of a surgeon and any Treace Product.</p>\n<p>The inclusion of a physician in the Find A Doctor database is not an endorsement or recommendation of that physician, and the fact that a physician is not included in the database does not mean that the physician is not qualified to perform the Lapiplasty<sup>\u00ae</sup> procedure.\nListed physicians have provided the information contained in their profiles, which Treace has not verified.\nTreace does not verify or monitor the licenses, credentials, accreditations, or qualifications of the physicians listed in the database and is not responsible for the medical advice of any of the listed physicians.\nYou are solely responsible for your communications and interactions with any listed medical professionals, and any information you send to them is not governed by Treace\u2019s Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>Some surgeons may represent that they perform the Lapiplasty<sup>\u00ae</sup> Procedure, but with \u201calternative instrumentation and implants\u201d.\nDon\u2019t risk your health, ask your surgeon if they are using the Lapiplasty<sup>\u00ae</sup> System manufactured and patented by Treace.\nIf they are not, then they are not performing Lapiplasty<sup>\u00ae</sup> 3D Bunion Correction<sup>\u2122</sup>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.5&nbsp;&nbsp.\nProduct Discontinuation.</strong> Treace reserves the right to discontinue the sale of any Treace Product listed on the Websites at any time without notice.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nLiability Limitations and Your

TREACE HAS BEEN ADVISED AS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF SUCH EXCLUSIONS CAUSE THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY REMEDY TO FAIL OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OR (2) THE ACTIONS OR OMISSIONS OF A USER OR ANY THIRD PARTY.\nTO THE EXTENT THAT THE FOREGOING LIMITATION IS NOT APPLICABLE OR IS PROHIBITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, NONE OF THE TREACE PARTIES WILL BE LIABLE FOR TOTAL DAMAGES FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND/OR THE WEBSITES IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT GREATER THAN $500.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.3&nbsp;&nbsp.\nLimitations in Certain Jurisdictions.</strong> SOME

Treace.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.5&nbsp;&nbsp.\nYour Responsibility.</strong> Except to the extent prohibited under applicable law, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Treace Parties from
