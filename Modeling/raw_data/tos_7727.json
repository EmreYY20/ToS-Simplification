DEBTOR.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>22.\nGoverning Law.</p>\n<p>This EULA is governed by the laws of the United Kingdom.\nIf a lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under this EULA, then you and FTL agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the United Kingdom for the purpose of litigating any dispute.\nWe operate the Service from our offices in the United Kingdom, and we make no representation that Materials included in the Service are appropriate or available for use in other locations.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>23.\nGeneral.</p>\n<p>This EULA is the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and FTL regarding your use of the Service.\nExcept as expressly permitted above, this EULA may be amended only by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of all parties to this EULA.\nYou may not assign or transfer this EULA or your rights under this EULA, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent.\nWe may assign this EULA at any time without notice or consent.\nThe failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of this EULA, or any provision of this EULA, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.\nUse of section headers in this EULA is for convenience only and will have no impact on the interpretation of any provision.\nIf any part of this EULA is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.\nUpon termination of this EULA, Sections 2, and 4 through 25, and any other accompanying agreements, will survive.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>24.\nDispute Resolution and Arbitration</p>\n<p>24.1.\nGenerally.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>In the interest of resolving disputes between you and FTL in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and FTL agree that every dispute arising in connection with this EULA will be resolved by binding arbitration.\nArbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\nThis agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this EULA, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of this EULA.\nYOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS EULA, YOU AND FTL ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>24.2.\nExceptions.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Despite the provisions of Section 24.1, nothing in this EULA will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court.\n(b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available.\n(c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law.\nor (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>24.3.\nArbitrator.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Any arbitration between you and FTL will take place at a mutually-agreed location in the county of Surrey, UK.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>24.4.\nNotice.\nProcess.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified Mail with signature required or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (\u201cNotice\u201d).\nFTL\u2019s address for Notice is: 20 Nugent Road, Surrey Research Park, Guildford, GU2 7AF, Surrey, UK.\nThe Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\u201cDemand\u201d).\nThe parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 60 days after the Notice is received, you or FTL may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or FTL must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIf the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, FTL will pay you the highest of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any.\n(ii) the last written settlement amount offered by FTL in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator\u2019s award.\nor (iii) $100.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>24.5.\nDecision.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>24.6.\nNo Class Actions.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>YOU AND FTL AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nFurthermore, unless both you and FTL agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>24.7.\nModifications to this Arbitration Provision.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>If FTL makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to FTL\u2019s address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to FTL\u2019s address for Notice, in which case your account with FTL will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>24.8.\nEnforceability.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>If Section 24.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 24 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 24 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 22 will govern any action arising out of or related to this EULA.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>25.\nConsent to Electronic Communications.</p>\n<p>By using the Service, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us.\nYou agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>26.\nContact Information.</p>\n<p>The FTL Software and the Service are offered by Future Tech Labs Limited, located at 20 Nugent Road, Surrey Research Park,
