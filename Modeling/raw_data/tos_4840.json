that is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, Article 6(1)(b) GDPR serves as the legal basis.\nThis also includes processing operations that are necessary for the performance of pre-contractual measures.</p>\n<p>Insofar as the processing of personal data is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Article 6 (1) lit.\nc GDPR serves as the legal basis.</p>\n<p>If the processing is necessary to protect a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not override the former interest, Article 6 (1) lit.\nf GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing.\nThe legitimate interest of our company lies in the performance of our

the data is stored and processed by Facebook, so that a connection to the respective user profile is possible and can be used by Facebook and for its own market research and advertising purposes.\nIf we should transmit data to Facebook for matching purposes, this data is encrypted locally in on the browser and only then sent to Facebook via a secure https connection.\nThis is done solely for the purpose of creating a comparison with the data encrypted in the same way by Facebook.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, when using the Facebook Pixel, we use the additional function \"extended matching\" (in this case, data such as telephone numbers, email addresses or Facebook IDs of the users) to create target groups (\"Custom Audiences\" or \"Look Alike Audiences\") are transmitted to Facebook (encrypted).\nFurther information on \"advanced matching\": https://www.facebook.com/business/help/611774685654668.</p>\n<p>For more information on the purpose and scope of data collection and the

possible measures have been taken to ensure compliance with European data protection law.</p>\n<p>We use these services to ensure the full and improved functionality of our website.</p>\n<p>Cloudflare

tool descriptions above, we use tools from US third-party providers.\nInsofar as this is necessary for the notified purposes, it may happen that your IP address is processed in this course outside the European Economic Area, where a level of data protection corresponding to the European standard is not consistently ensured and confirmed (for example, by appropriate guarantee within the meaning of Art.\n46 DS-GVO or an adequacy decision of the European Commission).\nTherefore, it cannot be ruled out in particular that security authorities in a third country may gain access to your IP address without you being able to take legally effective action against them.</p>\n<p>The transfer of the IP address to these third-party providers takes place in accordance with Art.\n49 (1) lit.\na GDPR on the basis of your consent expressly given for this purpose in the consent banner.\nThis consent is voluntary.\nYou can revoke it at any time with effect for the future.\nYou will not suffer any disadvantages as a result.</p>\n<p>In the opinion of some US third-party providers, a level of protection corresponding to the European standard is already guaranteed due to the conclusion of so-called standard contractual clauses as well as additional measures taken in the sense of the Schrems II case law.\nHowever, since the suitability of such measures to ensure a sufficient level of data protection is disputed, we have decided to transfer your IP address only with your consent.</p>\n</li>\n<li> Rights of the data subject <p>You have a right to information about the personal data stored by us about you.\nAccording to the legal provisions, you also have the right to correct incorrect data, blocking, data portability and deletion of your personal data.\nTo do this, send us an e-mail with the subject \"Data protection\".</p>\n<p>You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority if you believe that processing of personal data relating to you is in breach of the law.</p>\n<p>If you have given your consent, you have the right to revoke your consent at any time.\nThis does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the revocation.</p>\n<p>You may object to the future processing of your personal data in accordance with the legal requirements at any time.\nThe objection can be made in particular against the processing for purposes of direct advertising.</p>\n</li>\n<li> Storage period of the personal data <p>If we have not provided storage information on the specific points, the following applies: We store personal data for the duration of the respective statutory retention period or as long as the purpose of the collection exists.\nAfter expiry of the retention period, the data is routinely deleted, unless it is necessary for the initiation or performance of a contract.\nIf user data is not deleted because it is required for other and legally permissible purposes, its processing will be restricted as far as possible.\nAccordingly, the data will be blocked if possible and not processed for other purposes.\nThis applies, for example, to user data that must be retained for reasons of commercial or tax law.</p>\n</li>\n<li> Safety information <p>We make every effort to process your personal data by taking all technical and organizational possibilities to comply with the provisions of data protection laws and thus to protect this data.\nOur website or the communication via our website with us is encrypted via HTTPS.</p>\n</li>\n<br>\n<p>This privacy
