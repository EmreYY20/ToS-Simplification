certain other premium features and functionalities of Aim Lab or other areas of the Services that we tell you about.\nWe may also offer Virtual Goods in the form of on-platform currency purchasable with real world currency (\u201c<strong>Credits</strong>\u201d).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>No Monetary Value to Virtual Goods.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you initiate a Transaction for Virtual Goods, since Virtual Goods are basically make-believe items in a digital space, you are actually receiving a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable, revocable license and right to use such Virtual Goods solely within the Services for your personal and non-commercial entertainment use and for no other purpose.\nAny Virtual Goods you receive via the Services remain the property of Statespace, have no monetary value and are not redeemable or refundable for any \u201creal world\u201d money or anything of monetary value.\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, we may modify, substitute, replace, suspend, cancel, or eliminate such Virtual Goods or revoke your license to such Virtual Goods, at any time, in our sole discretion, consistent with these Terms and with no liability to you.</p>\n<p>YOU AGREE THAT YOU WON\u2019T ASSERT OR BRING ANY CLAIM AGAINST STATESPACE, ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR LICENSORS RELATING TO (A) A CLAIM THAT

you purchase Virtual Goods, or a Subscription (each, a \u201c<strong>Transaction</strong>\u201d), you expressly authorize us (or our third-party payment processor, which may also be the Software Provider) to charge you for such Transaction (plus any applicable taxes and other charges).\nYou may need to include appropriate payment information such as your credit card number and its expiration date, and your billing and email addresses (\u201c<strong>Payment Information</strong>\u201d).\nYou represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment method(s) represented by any such Payment Information.\nYou may also need to provide other information to verify your identity so we can authorize the Transaction (such information is included within the definition of Payment Information).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Subscriptions.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>Subscriptions</u>.\nIf you purchase a recurring Subscription, you will be charged either the monthly or annual Subscription fee, plus any applicable taxes, and other charges (\u201c<strong>Subscription Fee</strong>\u201d), at the beginning of your Subscription and each month or year thereafter, at the then-current Subscription Fee.\nBY PURCHASING A SUBSCRIPTION, YOU AUTHORIZE STATESPACE TO INITIATE RECURRING NON-REFUNDABLE PAYMENTS AS SET FORTH BELOW.\nIf you purchase a Subscription, we (or our third-party payment processor) will automatically charge you each month (or year, for an annual subscription) on the anniversary of the commencement of your Subscription, using the Payment Information you have provided until you cancel your Subscription.\nIf you purchase an annual subscription, no less than thirty (30) days and no more than sixty (60) days before your Subscription term ends, or otherwise in accordance with applicable law, Statespace will send you a reminder with the then-current Subscription Fee.\nBy agreeing to these Terms and electing to purchase a Subscription, you acknowledge that your Subscription has recurring payment features, and you accept responsibility for all recurring payment obligations prior to cancellation of your Subscription by you or Statespace.\nYour Subscription continues until cancelled by you or we terminate your access to or use of the Services or Subscription in accordance with these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Refunds</u>.&nbsp;If you conduct a Transaction through a Software Provider, that Software Provider\u2019s terms may also apply to your Transaction.\nIf you conduct a Transaction on the Steam Store, the Steam refund policy applies to your Transaction (http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/).\nwe offer refunds on Virtual Goods in accordance with Steam\u2019s refund policy.\nFor Transactions outside the Steam Store, unless otherwise allowed by Software Provider\u2019s purchase terms or otherwise required under applicable law in your jurisdiction, ALL PURCHASES ARE FINAL AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CANCEL THE PURCHASE AND/OR RECEIVE A REFUND OF YOUR TRANSACTION.\nIf something unexpected happens in the course of completing a Transaction, we reserve the right to cancel your Transaction for any reason.\nif we cancel your Transaction, we\u2019ll refund any payment you have already remitted to us for such Transaction.\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>Canceling Your Subscription</u>.\nWithout limiting the foregoing, you may cancel your Subscription at any time, but please note that such cancellation will be effective at the end of the then-current Subscription period.\nYOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY PORTION OF THE SUBSCRIPTION FEE PAID FOR THE THEN CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD AT THE TIME OF CANCELLATION.\nTo cancel, you can send an email to help@statespacelabs.com or use the controls available in your Account profile.\nYou will be responsible for all Subscription Fees (plus any applicable taxes and other charges) incurred for the then-current Subscription period.\nIf you cancel, your right to use the Services will continue until the end of your then current Subscription period and will then terminate without further charges.\nPlease note that after your Subscription is cancelled, you will lose access to certain paid features in StatsCenter and Aimlabs, and any other features of the Services that require a Subscription to use or access, and certain data or information regarding your use of these features may be deleted.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Credits.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>As a platform-based virtual token, Credits are a Virtual Good you can purchase for the purpose of awarding Creators.\nSpending Credits through the Services is solely for a User\u2019s personal entertainment and does not create any legally enforceable contract between you and us or you and any Creator.\nCredits have no inherent monetary value, do not earn interest, are not your private property, and are not redeemable for cash.\nThere may be a maximum amount of Credits you are able to hold or purchase at a given time, or a maximum number of Transactions you may make per day, each as determined in our sole discretion.\n</p>\n<p>Creators may apply for \u201c<strong>Creator Privileges</strong>,\u201d enabling Users to award Credits to such Creators other users in return for Coaching Services or the provision of Content (such Creators, \u201c<strong>Eligible Creators</strong>\u201d).\nEligible Creators may be provided an opportunity to receive payment in U.S.\ndollars based on the amount of Credits earned at a rate communicated via the functionality of the Services (\u201c<strong>Cash Out</strong>\u201d).\nThe Cash Out amounts are determined in our sole discretion and they may not necessarily correlate with past amounts paid.\nYou are responsible for all applicable taxes or duties in connection with any Cash Out.\n.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.\nYou Might Just Be Bad at Games.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We hope that your use of Aim Lab and other Services help to improve your skills in video games.\nHowever, we cannot guarantee any such results.\nThere is no one-size-fits-all fix to improve someone\u2019s abilities for how to play or perform in a video game, especially collaborative and team-based video games.\nJust ask anyone with a microphone and a PC\u2014some people are just bad at games, even people on your own team.\nWe are not responsible if you do not see any results from the use of Aim Lab and the Services.\nIf you do see great results though, feel free to give us a shout-out.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.\nContent and Content

it.\nHowever, in certain instances, some of your User Content (such as posts or comments you make) needs to be maintained for context (e.g., if you want to delete a question but the answers may be helpful to others), for record retention purposes, or as otherwise disclosed in our Privacy Policy.\nIn these circumstances, User Content may not be completely removed and copies of your User Content may continue to exist on the Services.\nTo the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not responsible or liable for the removal or deletion of (or the failure to remove or delete) any of your User

\u201c<strong>Beta</strong>\u201d).\nAs the name implies, Betas are not guaranteed to work properly and may make other parts of your system not work properly as well.\nFor the license granted to you in Section 12 above to extend to the Beta (meaning, for you to have permission to use the Beta), you acknowledge and agree to the following terms in addition to the rest of these Terms:</p>\n<p>Statespace may automatically delete or modify the information stored on your computer related to the Beta for any reason at any time during the duration of the beta
