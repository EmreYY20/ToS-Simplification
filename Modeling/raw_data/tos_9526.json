2021</p> Scope of Disclosures <p>These Additional European Economic Area (\u201c<strong>EEA</strong>\u201d) Privacy Disclosures supplement the information contained in our Privacy Notice.\nIn addition, these Disclosures apply only to our processing of your personal data where you are based in the EEA.</p>\n<p>Internet Society (\u201c<strong>ISOC</strong>,\u201d \u201c<strong>we</strong>,\u201d or \u201c<strong>us</strong>\u201d)is the data controller responsible for the collection and use of such personal data.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise expressly stated, capitalized terms in these Disclosures have the same meaning as defined in the Privacy Notice.</p>\n<p>When we use the term \u201c<strong>personal data</strong>\u201d in these Disclosures, we mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.</p> Legal Basis for Processing <p>Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in our Privacy Notice depends on what the information is and the context in which we collect it.</p>\n<p>However, we will normally collect information from you only where we need it to perform our contract with you (i.e., our Terms of Service), where the processing is in our legitimate interests (provided that these are not overridden by your interests or rights), or if we otherwise have your consent.</p>\n<p>In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation or need to collect personal data from you or may otherwise need the personal data to protect your vital interests or those of another person (for example, another Member or event attendee).</p>\n<p>If we ask you to provide personal data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, this will normally be clear from the context in which we are asking you to provide your information (for example, when we ask you to provide a username to access our Services, this will be to create an account for you in accordance with our Terms of Service), and, if not, we will provide an explanation to you at the relevant time.\nWe will also make clear whether providing information is mandatory.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if we collect and use your personal data in reliance on legitimate interests (or those of any third party) which are not listed above, it will be made clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are (such as personalizing our services and marketing, for example).</p>\n<p>If you have questions or need further information about the legal bases on which we collect and use your personal data, you may contact us using the contact information in the Contact Us section below.</p> Data Retention <p>We retain personal data about you for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in these Disclosures unless a longer period is required under applicable law or is needed to resolve disputes or protect our legal rights.</p>\n<p>The criteria used to determine the period for which personal data about you will be retained varies, depending on the legal basis under which we process the personal data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Legitimate</strong>\n<strong>Interests</strong>: Where we are processing personal data based on our legitimate interests, we generally will retain such information for a reasonable period of time based on the particular interest, taking into account the fundamental interests and the rights and freedoms of data subjects.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Consent</strong>: Where we are processing personal data based on your consent, we generally will retain the information for the period of time necessary to fulfill the underlying agreement with you, subject to your right, under certain circumstances, to withdraw consent and to have certain parts of your data erased (please see the Your Privacy Rights section).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Contract</strong>: Where we are processing personal data based on contract, we generally will retain the information for the duration of the contract plus some additional limited period of time that is necessary to comply with law, or that represents the statute of limitations for legal claims that could arise from the contractual relationship.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Legal Obligation</strong>: Where we are processing personal data based on a legal obligation, we generally will retain the information for the period of time necessary to fulfil the legal obligation.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Legal Claim</strong>: We may need to apply a \u201clegal hold\u201d that retains information beyond our typical retention period where we face threat of legal claim.&nbsp.\nIn that case, we will retain the information until the hold is removed, which typically means the claim or threat of claim has been resolved.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In all cases, in addition to the purposes and legal bases, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, as well as the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data.</p> International Data Transfers <p>We may transfer personal data about you among us and to our subsidiaries or affiliates, as well as to the categories of third parties identified in the Privacy Notice.\nPersonal data may be transferred to, stored and processed in a country other than the one in which it was collected, including, but not limited to, the United States.\nThe country to which personal data is transferred may not provide the same level of protection for personal data as the country from which it was transferred.</p>\n<p>We may transfer personal data about you outside the EEA and when we do so, we rely on appropriate or suitable safeguards recognized under the GDPR, including adequacy decisions and standard contractual clauses.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Adequacy Decisions</strong>.\nWe may transfer personal data about you to countries that the European Commission has deemed to adequately safeguard personal data.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Standard Contractual Clauses</strong>.\nThe European Commission has adopted Standard Contractual Clauses which provide safeguards

law):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Access:</strong> The right to access and obtain a copy of personal data about you, as well as information relating to its processing.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Rectification</strong>: The right to correct or update any personal data about you that is inaccurate or incomplete.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Restriction of Processing</strong>: The right to require us to limit the purposes for which we process your personal data if the continued processing of the personal data in this way is not justified, such as where the accuracy of the personal data is contested by you.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Erasure</strong>: The right to request the deletion or erasure of personal data about you without undue delay if the continued processing of that personal information is not justified.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Portability</strong>: The right to obtain a copy of personal data about you in an easily accessible format and the right to transmit that personal data to another controller.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Objection to Processing</strong>: You also have the right to object to any processing based on our legitimate interests where there are grounds relating to your particular situation.\nThere may be compelling reasons for continuing to process your personal data, and we will assess and inform you if that is the case.\nYou can object to marketing activities for any reason.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note that if the exercise of these rights limits our ability to process personal data, we may not be able to provide our products or services to you, or otherwise engage with you going forward.</p>\n<p>Right to Withdraw Consent<strong>.&nbsp.\n</strong>Where we rely on your consent for processing of your personal data, you also have the right to withdraw your consent to such processing, subject to certain limitations at law.</p>\n<p>You may withdraw your consent by contacting us at legal@isoc.org or by following the instructions outlined in the initial consent notice.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Submitting Requests.&nbsp;</strong>To submit a request, please contact us as set forth in the Contact Us

exercise the rights described above.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Right to Lodge a Complaint.&nbsp;</strong>If you have any complaints regarding our privacy practices, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your national data protection authority (i.e., supervisory authority).</p> Updates to These Disclosures <p>We may update these Disclosures from time to time.\nWhen we make changes to these
