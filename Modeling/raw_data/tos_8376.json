TECHNICAL SUPPORT</p>\n<p>5-1 Tools and Documentation provided by Abstultus</p>\n<p>Abstultus makes available to the Customer a set of tools and documentations which are accessible on the Abstultus Site.\n</p>\n<p>These pages also include contact information to reach the Abstultus staff.</p>\n<p>On these pages, Abstultus makes available to its Customer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a set of documentation and technical guides, designed to provide a better understanding and an easier use of the Service (\u201cDocumentation\u201d);</li>\n<li>communication tools to find out about the condition of Abstultus\u2019 facilities;</li>\n<li>contact information to reach Abstultus\u2019 Technical Support;</li>\n<li>and an Incident Reporting Form and/or a Ticketing System</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Preliminary checks:</p>\n<p>In the event of Service malfunction, it is the Customer\u2019s responsibility to consult the Documentation and perform the technical tests suggested by Abstultus on the Abstultus Site

Procedure:</p>\n<p>In order to report an Incident, the Customer shall complete the form designed for such purpose on the website and/or go to the Ticketing System where earlier tickets of electronic exchanges between the Customer and Abstultus may be found.</p>\n<p>The Customer shall complete the form or ticket on the Abstultus Site and attempt to provide as much information as possible on the problem encountered to help with the Diagnostic.</p>\n<p>To this end, the Customer explicitly authorizes Abstultus and its staff to connect to the Customer\u2019s Service and to perform any operation required in connection with the Diagnostic, with respect to both the hardware and the software.\nAbstultus reserves the right to reject any intervention in this regard if Abstultus notices in its research work that the Customer uses the Service in breach of Abstultus\u2019 General and Specific Terms and Conditions or of laws and regulations in force.</p>\n<p>All the exchanges between the parties, and more particularly the electronic exchanges and telephone conversations, shall reflect Customer\u2019s assent to Abstultus\u2019 intervention.</p>\n<p>5-3 Incident Takeover and Development of Diagnostic</p>\n<p>Abstultus shall, in connection with the Incident reporting procedure, carry out a Diagnostic in order to determine the origin and cause of the malfunction problem.\nIf, during

entirely borne by Abstultus, in compliance with the Agreement terms and conditions applicable to the Service.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if the Diagnostic reveals that Abstultus does not bear responsibility for the Incident encountered by the Customer or that its existence cannot be confirmed the time spent by Abstultus on carrying out the Diagnostic will be invoiced to the Customer at a flat rate available for consultation noted on Abstultus\u2019 Website.\nThese fees may be waived at the sole discretion of Abstultus on an individual Incident basis.\nAny waiver of fees for any particular Incident does not constitute a waiver of any other rights of Abstultus under this agreement nor a waiver of future fees for future incidents.</p>\n<p>In the event of Abstultus being unable to identify the origin or the cause of the incident, the investigations relating to production of the Diagnostic will not be invoiced to the Customer if Abstultus is unable to identify the cause of the dysfunction, or if Abstultus is unable to provide the customer with a quotation for the correction of the malfunction.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the Diagnostic will not be invoiced to the Customer if Abstultus is unable to provide a quotation for the correction of the incident.</p>\n<p>The Customer undertakes not to improperly make use of the Technical Assistance.\nAbstultus reserves the right to refuse to handle a Customer request if their conduct or the frequency of their requests is likely to adversely affect the normal operation of the Technical Assistance Service.</p>\n<p>The Customer agrees to avoid using the Technical Support service in an abusive manner.\nAbstultus reserves the right to refuse to respond to a Customer\u2019s claim if the Customer\u2019s behavior or the frequency of claims is likely to disrupt the normal operations of the Technical Support service.</p>\n<p>5-4 Resolution of Malfunction</p>\n<p>At the end of the Diagnostic, Abstultus shall inform the Customer on the cause of the malfunction and indicate which technical solutions will be used to resolve the problem encountered.</p>\n<p>At the end of the Diagnostic, Abstultus will convey the cause of the malfunction and will direct the Customer to the technical solutions for resolving the problem encountered.<br>\nIn the event of Abstultus not bearing the responsibility for the Malfunction, Abstultus will forward a quotation to the Customer corresponding to the cost of the resolution operations, if the Customer wants Abstultus to take charge of resolving its problem.</p>\n<p>As previously stated, ABSTULTUS only has an obligation of means.</p>\n<p>5.5 Conditions of payment</p>\n<p>The base price of the quotation is set out on the Abstultus Site.\nThe sums due will be invoiced monthly on the anniversary date of technical support being received for the Service.\nIn the event of monthly renewal of the Service, all sums due relating to this Service, including technical support, will be invoiced.</p>\n<p>No new interventions will be carried out if the payment of the preceding intervention has not been honored.</p>\n<p>SECTION 6:</p>\n<p>6.1.\nTerm</p>\n<p>The Service agreement shall be signed for an indefinite term.\nAbstultus reserves the right to suspend the Service at any time.\nAbstultus shall, to the extent possible, notify in advance the Service users, through a message on

possibly not renew its Service at the end of the term.\nAbstultus shall make every effort to inform the Customer beforehand regarding this and shall delete all the data stored by the Customer on the Service.\nThe Customer hereby agrees to recover all his/its data prior to the end of the Service term.</p>\n<p>Any non-payment or irregular payment, meaning incorrect or incomplete amounts in particular, or lacking the required references, or made by any method or procedure not accepted by Abstultus are not acceptable and will result in rejection by Abstultus of the registration or renewal request.</p>\n<p>Concerning renewals paid by check, it is up to the Customer to request the renewal with sufficient time for the check to be received and processed by Abstultus prior to expiration of the Service.\nAbstultus reminds the Customer that the processing of a payment by check may take more than 5 working days in some cases.</p>\n<p>SECTION 7: TERMINATION, LIMITATION AND SUSPENSION OF SERVICE</p>\n<p>Breach by the Customer of his/its obligations as defined hereunder, including all activities specifically barred while using Abstultus services and/or any content specifically barred when using Abstultus services, and/or likely to result in civil and/or criminal liability and/or likely to prejudice a third party\u2019s rights, shall give rise to Abstultus\u2019 right to

have a right to claim.</p>\n<p>At the end of the term of this Service, for any reason whatsoever, Abstultus shall entirely delete all the files on the Customer\u2018s Service.</p>\n<p>Abstultus

of Service offered by Abstultus provide for such sanctions in the event of a breach.</p>\n<p>The restriction, limitation or suspension measures shall always be taken in accordance with the seriousness or recurrence of the breach(es), and shall be based on the nature of such breach(es).</p>\n<p>The Customer agrees in advance that Abstultus may restrict, limit or suspend the Service offered if Abstultus receives a notice in that regard from a competent administrative, arbitral or judicial authority, in compliance with the laws and regulations in force.</p>\n<p>Either Party may terminate the Agreement, as of right and without indemnity, in the case of a Force Majeure event lasting more than thirty (30) days.<br>\nAbstultus reserves the right to interrupt the Customer\u2019s Service if such Service endangers the maintenance of security or stability on Abstultus\u2019 hosting platform.\nAbstultus shall, to the extent possible, give the Customer prior notice regarding such interruption.</p>\n<p>Abstultus reserves the right to interrupt the Service, as needed, for technical interventions designed to improve its operations, or for maintenance procedures.</p>\n<p>SECTION

would be unable to resolve.</p>\n<p>However, the Service shall be restricted, limited or suspended, as of right, by Abstultus:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if it seems that the Customer is using the services provided for any activity whatsoever which is not in compliance with these General Terms and Conditions;</li>\n<li>in compliance with the applicable Specific Terms and Conditions;</li>\n<li>if Abstultus receives a notice in that regard from a competent administrative, arbitral or judicial authority, in compliance with the appropriate applicable laws, or from a third party;</li>\n<li>if the

agreement.</p>\n<p>Abstultus reserves the right to monitor compliance with the Service\u2019s terms of use.</p>\n<p>SECTION 10: TOLERANCE</p>\n<p>The fact that Abstultus fails to invoke one of the General Terms and Conditions of Service and/or tolerates the violation by the other Party of any of the obligations hereunder shall not be construed as a waiver to invoke in the future any of these Terms and Conditions.</p>\n<p>SECTION 11: PERSONAL DATA</p>\n<p>Abstultus reminds the Customer that, while providing the Service to the Customer, Abstultus may keep some of the Customer\u2019s
