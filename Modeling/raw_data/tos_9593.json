or Compass Education Holdings (EU - Ireland) \"CompassPay\" depending on your location.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some cards carry more than one payment system function.\nThese can be identified because they have either a Visa or Mastercard logo on the front of the card and an eftpos logo on the back of the card.\nA merchant can choose which payment system processes the transaction from those cards as both functions point to the same card account.\nIf your card only has the eftpos logo then it has not yet been enabled by your bank for transactions from your card.</p>\n<p>If you are under the age of eighteen (18), you may use payment functionality with Compass only with the consent and involvement of your parent or guardian.\nPlease ensure that you review this document with your parent or guardian so that you both understand your rights and obligations.</p>Making payments and purchases<p>1.\nWhen making payments through Compass you agree to provide a valid funding instrument.</p>\n<p>2.\nPay attention to the details of the transaction, as the total price may include taxes (including GST, HST and/or VAT), fees and/or shipping costs.\nIf you require any additional information on included costs, please contact us, or your data owner (school or organisation), prior to making payment.</p>\n<p>3.\nAdditional terms may also be included at the time of purchase, this may include additional refund procedures and timeframes.</p>\n<p>4.\nIf you purchase a subscription to a feature or register for reoccurring payments, we will usually bill your funding instrument immediately, and then again at the specified billing dates.\nInstalment, reoccurring or subscription billing dates are provided as an indication only and your funding instrument may be charged before or after the date provided.</p>\n<p>5.\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that the funding instrument is available.\nWe will not be held responsible for any interest or overdraw charges or other fees that may result in exceeding your credit limit or entering overdraft.</p>\n<p>6.\nYou acknowledge that many products or services provided within Compass are sold by sub-merchants, not CompassPay Pty Limited or Compass Education Holdings Limited.\nDepending on the product or service purchased through our platform the method of receipt may vary.\nWhere possible we will issue you with a valid tax invoice, however, in some circumstances, the sub-merchant may provide this to you outside of our platform.\nWe make no warranties of any kind, express or implied, with respect to the products or sold, by our sub-merchants, on or through Compass.</p>Methods of payment<p>7.\nFor your convenience, we may offer various forms of payment for transactions in Compass.\nPayment options may vary between sub-merchants based on their subscription and or the module selected.\nThese may include credit cards, cash, cheque, direct debit phone and voucher options.</p>\n<p>8.\nWe do restrict some forms of payments, including but not limited to payments made by American Express or internationally issued credit cards.\nIn some circumstances we may permit payments using these methods, however, surcharges may apply.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>9.\nWhen you provide us with details of a funding instrument, you confirm that you are permitted to use that instrument.\nWhen you fund a transaction, you authorise us (and/or our designated payment processors) to charge the full amount to the funding instrument, that you designate for the transaction.\nYou also authorise us to collect and store details of the funding instrument, along with other related transaction information.\nDetails are stored in alignment with our PCI DSS requirements and in alignment with our privacy policy.</p>\n<p>10.\nIf you fund a payment by direct debit card and your load transaction results in an overdraft or other fees from your bank, you alone are responsible for that fee.</p>\n<p>11.\nCompass is not a bank, accordingly, if you deposit any funds into your Compass Wallet they do not earn interest and are not insured by federal bank protections or guarantees.</p>Ongoing assessment and management<p>12.\nWe may revoke your access to and/or ability to make payments at any time at our sole discretion.</p>\n<p>13.\nAbandoned Property.\nIf you leave a balance unused, in your account, it will be forfeited after your account is closed or deactivated.</p>\n<p>14.\nBy using Compass for payments, you acknowledge and understand that we may make inquiries that we consider necessary, into your identity or creditworthiness.</p>\n<p>15.\nWe may cancel any transaction if we believe the transaction violates our terms or us or if we believe doing so may prevent financial loss.</p>\n<p>16.\nSome application modules within our website offerings include 'minimum amounts'.\nThese minimum amounts vary from client to client, based on annual transaction amounts, merchant rates, level of associated risk, card type, service/product type, client minimums and numerous other factors.\nAccordingly, some functionality and credit card payments may be declined as a result of this.\nIn most circumstances, you will instead be presented with a printable confirmation/payment page.\nAdditionally, we may use the process of online payment for products and/or services as a method or for further verification of your identity, as such registration and/or purchasing of a service may be restricted in certain circumstances.</p>\n<p>17.\nWe may contact you by phone, email or post if we are unable to process your payment or require additional information.</p>\n<p>18.\nIn making a payment through Compass, you agree to honour the payment and accept liability for any chargeback fees, merchant fees, gateway fees, lost revenue, and interest (owed or calculated) and/or reasonable administrative charges, should your payment be denied, your credit limit exceeded, your card cancelled or a payment/transaction stop issued.</p>\n<p>19.\nPayments are conducted online as follows:</p>\n<p>a.\nFully automated with an immediate response</p>\n<p>b.\nAll transactions are encrypted</p>\n<p>c.\nProcessed by an either an authorised third party processor (PCI-DSS compliant) or a registered major Australian or European bank/s (based on your portal location)</p>\n<p>d.\nAll transactions are processed in compliance with PCI-DSS standards and obligations</p>\n<p>20.\nIn some circumstances, we may permit payment by credit cards other than VISA or MASTERCARD.\nIn these circumstances, additional fees may apply.</p>\n<p>21.\nIn the event that a payment is disputed or chargeback submitted for the payment, you permit us to provide details of the transaction (including any personal details) to our banking partners as required.</p>\n<p>22.\nIn order to prevent financial loss to you or us, we may delay or contact your funding instrument issuer, law enforcement, merchant user or relevant third party and share details of any payments you are associated with.</p>\n<p>23.\nWe provide various tools, within Compass, to assist you in contacting relevant merchant clients.\nIn the event that you are unable to contact the service provider, following a payment, please contact us directly.</p>\n<p>24.\nIf you enter into a transaction with a third party and have a dispute over the goods or service you purchased, we have no liability for the goods or services underlying the transaction unless required by law.</p>\n<p>25.\nYou may lookup details of a previous payment at the CompassPay website, www.CompassPay.com</p>\n<p>26.\nIf you believe an unauthorised or problematic transaction has taken place under your account, or against your funding instrument, you agree to notify us immediately, so that we may take action to prevent financial loss.\nUnless you submit the claim to us within 30 days after the charge, you will have waived, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all claims against us arising out of or otherwise related to the transaction.</p>\n<p>27.\nWe may intervene in disputes concerning payments that may arise between you and one of our clients, but we have no obligation to do so.</p>\n<p>28.\nIt is your responsibility to remit any taxes that apply to your transactions.\nYou agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any claim arising out of your failure to do so.</p>\n<p>29.\nBy using Compass services, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically any information regarding your purchases or account.\nWe may also provide notices to you by posting them within Compass.</p>\n<p>30.\nWe may update these terms at any time without notice as we deem necessary to the full extent permitted by law.\nThe payment terms in plate at the time you make a transaction will govern that transaction.</p>Surcharging<p>31.\nAustralia users - The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) published standard number 3 of 2016 regarding surcharging.\nThis standard clearly defines what sub-merchants can recover through the application of a card payment surcharge.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>32.&nbsp.\nThe Compass platform, by default, does not offer the ability to charge different amounts for different payment methods.\nAs such, schools or organisations that do not charge different amounts for different payment methods are not impacted.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>33.\nAustralia users - In the event that a sub-merchant is adding a credit card surcharge, this surcharge cannot exceed the cost of using the payment instrument.\nThis amount is detailed in our monthly sub-merchant reports.\nIn some cases, in alignment with RBA rules, additional processing charges may also be added to this amount.\nOur sub-merchants are provided with updated monthly summary statements, which have been externally reviewed, to ensure compliance with RBA obligations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>34.\nAustralia users - If you believe one of our sub-merchants is charging a surcharge fee above their incurred cost, please contact our team at credit@compass.education</p>\n<p>35.\nAustralia users - In some circumstances, we may offer a surcharge option for American Express or international card payments.\nIn these circumstances, the surcharge will not exceed the additional cost of processing using that payment instrument.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>36.\nSub-merchants are charged a combination of transaction and percentage charges which are not surcharges.\nThese are product and/or service charges, which may include merchant fees, for the provision of our goods and services.&nbsp;</p>Compass Balance<p>37.\nAny unused funds in your Compass Balance will expire 36 months after the date of fund transfer.</p>\n<p>38.\nIf you leave a balance unused, in your account, it will be forfeited after your account is closed or deactivated.</p>\n<p>39.\nTo transfer your Compass Balance to a nominated account a $2.50 transfer fee will apply and will be debited from your transfer.\nTo request a transfer please email credit@compass.education</p>\n<p>40.\nCompassIdentity cards may be used for some purchases at select providers.\nIdentity cards are subject to the CompassIdentity terms of use.</p>Refund Policy (Australia &amp.\nCanada)<p>As we act as a payment service provider, we recommend that you contact the provider for any refund or reimbursements in the first instance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Details of the merchant are available through your portal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Alternatively, in most circumstances you can identify the merchant from your credit card statement using the soft descriptor (eg.\nCOM* Example Primary School).</p>\n<p>In the event that you are unable to negotiate a refund with the merchant directly, you can contact us to investigate the payment.\nWe may request evidence of your correspondence with the merchant.</p>\n<p>In circumstances that a payment relates to the purchase of goods, we require evidence that the goods were returned in appropriate condition and within reasonable time frames.\nIn the event the returned goods have been damaged by you or in return transit, the cost of repairs may be deducted from the refund.\nAny returns should be sent by tracked and insured post.</p>\n<p>In the event that a payment relates to services, a refund will be assess based on usage of the services or costs incurred.\nParticular reference will be given to any service
