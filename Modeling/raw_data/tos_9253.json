Harassers:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The admins may ban or silence users whom we know to be harassers or abusers, even if they have not violated the rules of this instance.\nThe mere presence of a harasser can make past or potential victims uncomfortable, and it can put potential victims who are unaware of the person's history in particular danger.\nUsers are encouraged to individually mute, block, and/or report accounts they don't want to see, but at our discretion, we may take the additional step of blocking or silencing someone instance-wide if we believe they endanger the safe and welcoming space we're trying to maintain.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Reporting</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The current admins are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>joshuatj</li>\n<li>misty</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the admins.\nThey'll respond as promptly as they can.\nWe will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.\nAt our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we\u2019ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them.\nWe will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Understanding and Using CWs</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Mastodon offers content warnings, which allow one to post about topics while giving others an informed opportunity to decide whether or not to read your posts.\nThink of them as metadata for your post.\nUnlike hashtags, which are another great way to find or filter data (and you can use both!), CWs allow the reader to make a choice before viewing something which they may find distressing (such as racist imagery or political trends which threaten their health/job/family/friends) or ordinary things they may or may not want to see \u201chealth\u201d or \u201clewd\u201d or \u201crant/whine\u201d posts.\nCWs are especially important on public posts, since we all use the Local timeline.\nSome people write very descriptive CWs.\nOthers use shorthands popular in the Mastodon community.\nCommon examples of CWd topics and common shorthands:<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Politics: \u201cpol\u201d with a country prefix such \u201cuspol,\u201d \u201cukpol\u201d or more specific clarifications, such as \u201cpolitics, funding\u201d or \u201cpolitics shutdown\u201d or \u201cpolitics, 45\u201d</li>\n<li>Examples of hate speech by politicians/colleagues/family/students/etc.: \u201cHate speech\u201d \u201cnazis\u201d \u201cfascism\u201d \u201cantifacism\u201d \u201cracism\u201d \u201ctransphobia\u201d \u201cwhite supremacist fliers\u201d</li>\n<li>Sexually explicit: common shorthands include \u201clewd,\u201d \u201ckink,\u201d \u201cPDA\u201d</li>\n<li>Mental health/suicidal ideation: common abbreviations include \u201cmh+\u201d (good mental health stuff), \u201cmh-\u201d (negative mental health), \u201csuicide\u201d/\u201dsui\u201d</li>\n<li>Food/alcohol/drugs/meds: generally just noting the content.</li>\n<li>Eye-contact selfies: some mastodon users place selfies under \u201ceye contact\u201d if the poster is making eye contact with the viewer1.</li>\n<li>Content types: \u201crant\u201d \u201clong\u201d \u201cwhine\u201d \u201cspoilers\u201d<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An excellent longer-form CW example from 2018-01-22 would be \u201cnazis on campus, everyday antifacism,\u201d which conveys that the post both talks about an incident with nazis on campus and the response to it.\nPlease also keep in mind, that all posts to Public appear in the Local timeline and Mastodon allows you to make some posts Followers-Only or Unlisted.\nOn the other hand, if you see someone posting material which disturbs you without CWs in the main timeline, Mastodon\u2019s mute function will mean you don\u2019t see them.\nFilters can remove all posts containing a term (CWd and non-CWd) from a particular column.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Credits and License</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This code of conduct is based on glammr.us\u2019 code of conduct, which is in turn based on wandering.shop's code of
