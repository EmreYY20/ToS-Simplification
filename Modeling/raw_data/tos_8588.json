Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and in compliance with the applicable data protection laws.\nThis Policy provides you with the necessary information regarding your rights and our obligations, and explains how, why and when we process your personal data.</p>\n<p>The confidentiality and privacy of your data is very important to us and we are fully committed to protecting it.\nMailpanion will never sell or rent your personal data to third parties and will only share it when necessary to maintain your account and the Mailpanion service.\nWe are proud to say that we are one of the fighters for user privacy and service transparency.</p>What We Collect<p>Mailpanion users use Google integration features that require Mailpanion to access limited information from the Google account they provide.\nWhen these features are accessed by users and administrators, Mailpanion displays a message allowing the user to review the information that will be collected, including a link to this privacy policy, so they can choose to allow that access or cancel.\nThe following list gives details of each Mailpanion Google integration feature, and if that feature is used, the corresponding data collected and its purpose.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Basic One-Time Permissions: </b>Obtain your name, email, and google id from Google after you authorize Mailpanion.\nThis information will be used to register you and grant you access to the online dashboard.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Intercept Images in Your Emails: </b>As part of its integral functionality, Mailpanion automatically intercepts suspicious images in the body of emails you open a block the image from loading as needed.\nThe content of your email is not accessed by Mailpanion.\nThe detection and blocking feature can each be disabled by you in the settings on the dashboard.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Email Tracking and Tracker Blocking Statistics: </b>Mailpanion registers clicks on your emails and the links inside your emails
