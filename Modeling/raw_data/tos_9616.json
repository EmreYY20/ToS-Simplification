the UK, Knowles provides additional information to its EEA, Switzerland and UK based users.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>What is personal data?&nbsp;</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>\u201cPersonal data\u201d</strong>&nbsp;is information about you (a&nbsp;<strong>\u201cdata subject\u201d</strong>) the use of which is governed by applicable data protection laws.\nIt will include any information from which you can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as your name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or other information about your identity.\nMost User Information will constitute personal data.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>What is the legal basis on which Knowles relies to process your personal data?</strong>\n<br>\n<br>On some occasions, we process your personal data with your consent (for example, when you agree to participate in our surveys and other activities or when you give us consent to send you marketing communications (adopting a \u201cdouble-opt-in\u201d where required) or to deal with your enquiries, as set out in paragraph 3 letter (d)).<br>\n<br>On other occasions, we process your personal data when we need to do this in order to fulfil a contract with you (for example, to make available to you the requested content or for billing purposes) or in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract (for example, verifying your information), as set out in paragraph 3 letters (a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j) and (k).&nbsp;<br>\n<br>We also process your personal data when it is in our legitimate interests to do this and when these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights, as set out in paragraph 3 letters (c), (e), (j), (k), (l), (n) and (o).\nFor example, we may process your personal data in our legitimate interests to ensure that our Services and Services are provided efficiently and in an user-friendly and personalised manner taking into account user feedback, data and profiles, unless consent is required for any such processing under applicable law.\nWe will process personal data to ensure the security of our business and the information of our users, and to ensure the proper and efficient administration of our business.\nYou may contact us for further information.<br>\n<br>Finally, we will process your personal data where we are required to do this by law (for example, where we have to fulfil anti-money laundering requirements or disclose information under a court order), as set out in paragraph 3 letters (f), (g), (k) and (m).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n<strong>How long does Knowles keep data?</strong>\n<br>\n<br>Knowles keeps your data for only as long as required to provide you with the necessary Services and to carry out the processing set out in this notice, and in line with its obligation under applicable law.\nThis means that we will generally not keep your personal information for longer than six years following your last interaction with us, and the retention period will often be shorter.\nFor example, we may keep your information for marketing purposes for a period of 3 years following the termination or expiry of our relationship, or your last contact with us.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Your rights</strong>\n<br>\n<br>Data subjects may ask us for a copy of their information, to correct it, erase it or to transfer it to other organisations at their request.\nData subjects also have rights to object to some processing including profiling and, where we have asked for their consent to process the data subject\u2019s data, to withdraw this consent.\nIn particular, data subjects have the right to object to direct marketing at any time.\nWhere a data subject withdraws their consent, this will not affect the legitimacy of the processing conducted prior to your request.&nbsp.\nWhere we process data because we have a legitimate interest in doing so (as explained above), the data subject has a right to object to this.\nWhere we make a decision based solely on automated processing which significantly affects the data subject, he or she may have the right to contest the decision, express his or her point of view and obtain human intervention.\nData subjects have the right to have their data transferred to another provider.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>These rights may be limited in some situations \u2013 for example, where we can demonstrate that we have a legal requirement to process your data.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>Please use the contact information set out in our Contact section above.\nWe will aim to acknowledge your enquiries within 72 hours and respond within one month, unless otherwise required by law.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>We hope that we can satisfy queries you may have about the way we process your data.\nHowever, if you have unresolved concerns you also have the right to complain to your local data protection authority.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>CALIFORNIA ANNEX TO PRIVACY NOTICE \u2013 INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</strong>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>In order to comply with data privacy
