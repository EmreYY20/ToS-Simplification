property, and safety of ourselves and others.</li>\n<li>\n<em>With our affiliates.</em> We may share information between and among Alluder, and any of our parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Aggregated or de-identified information.</em> We may share information about you that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it

were.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How We Protect Your Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We take measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and
