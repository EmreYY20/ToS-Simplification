POLICY<p>\n<strong>3.1.\n\"Linden Dollars\" are virtual tokens that we license.\nEach Linden Dollar is a virtual token representing contractual permission from Linden Lab to access features of Second Life.\nLinden Dollars are available for Purchase or distribution at Linden Lab's discretion, and are not redeemable for monetary value from Linden Lab.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Second Life includes a component of virtual tokens (\"Linden Dollars\" or \"L$\"), each of which constitutes a limited license permission to use features of Second Life as set forth below.\nLinden Lab may or may not charge fees to acquire or use Linden Dollars, and these fees may change at any time.</p>\n<p>Each Linden Dollar that you may acquire constitutes a limited license granted to you by Linden Lab to access and use Content, applications, services, and various user-created features in Second Life, and is digitally represented in Second Life as a virtual token that can be traded and/or transferred in Second Life with other users (and/or Linden Lab) in exchange for permission to access and use specific Content, applications, services, and various user-created features, in each case in accordance with this Second Life Policy and the Terms of Service.\nLinden Dollars are transferable by the holder to any other user, provided that both users comply with these Terms of Service, maintain their Accounts in good standing, and are not delinquent on any Account payment requirements.\nExcept as expressly permitted by this Second Life Policy or otherwise expressly permitted by Linden Lab, Linden Dollars may not be sublicensed, encumbered, conveyed or made subject to any right of survivorship or other disposition by operation of law or otherwise, and you agree that any attempted disposition in violation of these Terms of Service is null and void.\nLinden Lab may revoke any Linden Dollar at any time without notice, refund or compensation in the event that: (i) the Linden Dollar program is suspended or discontinued.\n(ii) Linden Lab determines that fraud or other illegal conduct is associated with the holder's Account.\n(iii) Linden Lab imposes a fixed time period during which the license rights provided by the Linden Dollar may be exercised.\n(iv) the holder's Account is terminated for violation of these Terms of Service.\nor (v) the holder becomes delinquent on any of that user's Account payment requirements, ceases to maintain an active Account or terminates any of the Agreements.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge that Linden Dollars are not currency or any type of currency substitute or financial instrument, and are not redeemable for any sum of money from Linden Lab at any time.\nYou agree that Linden Lab has the right to manage, regulate, control, and/or modify the license rights underlying such Linden Dollars as it sees fit, and may revalue or make such license rights more or less common, valuable, effective, or functional, and that Linden Lab will have no liability to you based on its exercise of this right.\nLinden Lab makes no guarantee as to the nature, quality or value of the features of Second Life that will be accessible through the use of Linden Dollars, or the availability or supply of Linden Dollars.\nAs Linden Lab deems necessary, in its sole and absolute discretion, we may limit the total amount of Linden Dollars that may be purchased at any one time, and/or limit the aggregate amount of Linden Dollars that may be held in your Account.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.2.\nSecond Life may offer a Linden Dollar exchange (the \"LindeX exchange\" or \"LindeX\").</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Second Life may include a component called the \"LindeX exchange\" or the \"LindeX,\" which refers to an aspect of Second Life through which Linden Lab permits Linden Dollars to be purchased by a user or exchanged by a user with Linden Lab for a credit to the user\u2019s Stored Value Account (defined in Section 4.1 below) in accordance with these Terms.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge that the LindeX has been created to enhance your experience while using Second Life, and that Linden Lab may use the terms \"Buy\" and \"Sell\" to indicate the transfer of content licenses

accordance with these Terms.\n(b) the term \"Buy\" or \"Purchase\" means to purchase Linden Dollars from Linden Lab in exchange for consideration in accordance with these Terms.\nand (c) the terms \"Buyer,\" \"Seller,\" \"Sale,\" and \"Purchaser\" and similar terms have corresponding meanings to their root terms.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge that Linden Lab may deny any order to Buy or Sell individually or with respect to general volume, price or other limitations set by Linden Lab.\nLinden Lab may halt, suspend, discontinue, or reverse any LindeX exchange transaction (whether proposed, pending or past) in cases of actual or suspected fraud, violations of other laws or regulations, or deliberate disruptions to or interference with Second Life.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.3.\nLinden Dollars may not be purchased or sold outside of the LindeX exchange.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Any purchase or sale of Linden Dollars through any means other than the LindeX is not permitted and is considered a violation of these Terms of Service which may result in suspension or termination of your Account.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.4.\n\"Virtual Land\" is Virtual Space in Second Life that we license.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Second Life includes a component of Virtual Space that is stored on our Servers and made available in the form of virtual units (\"Virtual Land\").\nVirtual Land is the graphical representation of three-dimensional virtual world space.\nLinden Lab may or may not charge fees for the right to acquire, transfer or access Virtual Land, and these fees may change at any time.</p>\n<p>When you acquire Virtual Land, Linden Lab hereby grants you a limited license (\"Virtual Land License\") to access and use features of Second Life associated with the virtual unit(s) of space corresponding to the identifiers of the Virtual Land within Second Life as designated by Linden Lab, in accordance with this Second Life Policy, the Terms of Service and any other applicable policies, including the Second Life Mainland Policies as they exist from time to time.\nThe Virtual Land License is transferable by the holder to any other user provided that both users and the proposed transfer comply with the Terms of Service, maintain their accounts in good standing, and are not delinquent on any Account payment requirements.\nExcept as expressly permitted by this Second Life Policy, this Virtual Land License may not otherwise be encumbered, conveyed or made subject to any right of survivorship or other disposition and any attempted disposition in violation of the Agreements is null and void.\nLinden Lab may revoke the Virtual Land License at any time without notice, refund or compensation in the event that: (i) Linden Lab determines that fraud, illegal conduct or any other violations of the Agreements are associated with the holder's Account or Virtual Land.\nor (ii) the holder becomes delinquent on any of that user's Account's payment requirements, ceases to maintain an active Account or terminates any of the Agreements.</p>\n<p>You may permit or deny other users to access your Virtual Land on terms determined by you.\nAny agreement you make with other users relating to use or access to your Virtual Land must be consistent with the Agreements, and no such agreement can abrogate, nullify, void or modify the Agreements.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge that Virtual Land is a limited license right and is not a real property right or actual real estate, and it is not redeemable for any sum of money from Linden Lab.\nYou acknowledge that the use of the words \"Buy,\" \"Sell\" and similar terms carry the same meaning of referring to the transfer of the Virtual Land License as they do with respect to the Linden Dollar License.\nYou agree that Linden Lab has the right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate such Virtual Land as it sees fit and that Linden Lab shall have no liability to you based on its exercise of such right.\nLinden Lab makes no guarantee as to the nature of the features of Second Life that will be accessible through the use of Virtual Land, or the availability or supply of Virtual Land.</p>4.\nSTORED VALUE ACCOUNT<p>\n<strong>4.1 Generally</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Linden Lab has contracted with Tilia Inc.\n(\u201cTilia\u201d) to issue stored value accounts to you.\nIn order to use this feature, you must agree to the Tilia Terms of Service.\nThe stored value account is an account issued by Tilia in which you hold funds, denominated in U.S.\nDollars (\u201dUSD\u201d), which can be used as a funding method to make payments to Second Life (in addition to or in lieu of other supported payment methods which may be used with such service) (\u201cStored Value Accounts\u201d).\nThe use of each Stored Value Account is limited to Second Life.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.2 Crediting the Stored Value Account</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Each Stored Value Account may be credited through your exchange of Linden Dollars in accordance with Section 3 above.\nThe amount of the credit to your Stored Value Account will be determined based on the then-current purchase price of Linden Dollars.\nProvision of this credit is subject to the sole discretion of Tilia.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.3 Process Credit from Stored Value Account to Permitted Account</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you accumulate more value in your Stored Value Account than you need to pay amounts associated with your use of Second Life, Tilia may, in its discretion and subject to its agreement with Second Life, allow you to request a refund from your Stored Value Account.\nSubject to your compliance with Tilia\u2019s Terms of Service, you may be permitted to request that Tilia process a credit from your Stored Value Account, in an amount equal to all or a portion of the available funds associated with your Stored Value Account, to your PayPal account or other account permitted by Tilia.\nTilia, in its sole discretion, will approve or deny your request.\nIf approved, the request will be subject to a fee (the \u201cProcess Credit Fee\u201d) payable to Tilia, and the credit will be processed within approximately five (5) to ten (10) business days following the request.\nSome requests may take up to thirty (30) days to process.\nYou may see this concept referred to as a \u201cProcess Credit\u201d throughout Second Life and other materials.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.4 Funds in your Stored Value Account</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You are not required to maintain any funds in your Stored Value Account.\nIf you do hold funds in your Stored Value Account, those funds will not be insured to you by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other entity, and you will not be entitled to any interest with respect to such funds.</p>\n<p>You agree that Tilia may apply any funds to be credited to, or which are held in, your Stored Value Account to any amounts you owe Tilia.</p>5.\nCONDUCT BY USERS OF SECOND LIFE<p>In

you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: \"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the

Unsolicited Ideas and Materials Prohibited.\nNo Confidential or Special Relationship with Linden Lab.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Linden Lab employs a staff of designers to develop new ideas and Linden Lab solicits and receives product idea submissions from professional inventors with whom it has business relationships.</p>\n<p>Because of this, in your communications with Linden Lab, please keep in mind that Linden Lab does not accept or consider any unsolicited ideas or materials for products or services, or even improvements to products or services, (collectively, \"Unsolicited Ideas and Materials\").\nTherefore, you must not send to Linden Lab (even within any of your User Content that we may request), in any form and by any means, any Unsolicited Ideas and Materials.\nAny

like.\nLinden Lab will not assume any responsibility, obligation, or liability for the receipt or non-receipt of any of the foregoing.\nTherefore, your decision to submit any Unsolicited Ideas and Materials to Linden Lab does not place Linden Lab in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public with regard to your Unsolicited Ideas and Materials.</p>\n<p>Linden Lab's receipt of your Unsolicited Ideas and Materials is not an admission by Linden Lab of their novelty, priority, or originality, and it does not impair Linden Lab's right to contest existing or future intellectual property rights relating to your Unsolicited Ideas and Materials.</p>\n<p>Return to top</p>10.\nDISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION<p>By agreeing to these Terms of Service, you also agree to arbitrate any and all claims against Linden Lab pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act and subject to the terms below (the \"Agreement to Arbitrate\").\nYou and Linden Lab agree that we intend that this Section 10 satisfies the \"writing\" requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act and further agree that, notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms of Service, the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.1 If a dispute arises between you and Linden Lab regarding a claim, you and we agree to alternative dispute resolution.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly.\nIf any controversy, allegation or claim arises out of or relates to the Service, the Website(s), the Content, your User Content, your Unsolicited Ideas and Materials, this Agreement, your decision to enter into this Agreement, any Additional Terms or any other aspect of your relationship with Linden Lab (collectively, \"Dispute\"), then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it.\nOur notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information (including email address) that you provide us.\nYou are obligated to ensure that such contact information is current and accurate.\nYour notice to us must be sent to: Linden Research, Inc., 8605 Santa Monica Blvd PMB 59201, West Hollywood, California 90069-4109, Attention: General Counsel.\nFor a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, Linden and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute, though neither party is required to resolve such dispute on terms which each party, in its sole discretion, is uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>IF WE CANNOT RESOLVE A DISPUTE WITHIN SIXTY (60) DAYS OF RECEIPT OF SUCH NOTICE, THEN EITHER YOU OR WE MAY ELECT TO SUBMIT THE DISPUTE TO FORMAL ARBITRATION AS HEREINAFTER DESCRIBED.\nWITH ARBITRATION (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED.\nFurther, you and Linden Lab agree that, should resolution of the Dispute(s) occur in arbitration, such Dispute(s) will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitration or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.\nBut if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator selected pursuant to this arbitration provision holds that this restriction, limiting the arbitration to Dispute(s) between you and Linden Lab, is unenforceable, then our agreement above to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts of San Francisco County, California.</p>\n<p>Should either you or Linden Lab elect to resolve the Dispute by way of binding arbitration, the arbitration shall proceed in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), except that, as noted, in no event shall the arbitration proceed as a class or representative action.\nIf the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $10,000,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a single, neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than ten (10) years' experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the Dispute, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.\nIf the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $10,000,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a three (3) member panel, with one member to be selected by each party and the third (who will chair the panel) selected by the two (2) party-appointed members or by the AAA in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules.\nThe arbitrator or arbitration panel, as the case may be, will apply applicable law and the provisions of this Agreement and any Additional Terms, will determine any Dispute according to applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award.</p>\n<p>If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within sixty (60) days of the filing of a \"demand for arbitration,\" then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc.\n(\"JAMS\") using JAMS' streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and a legal officer of Linden Lab consent to in writing, except, as noted above, that in no event shall the arbitration proceed as a class or representative action.\nThe substantive practice area requirements for the arbitrator and the $10,000,000 threshold for the number of arbitrators assigned to the Dispute set forth in the paragraph above will also apply to any such arbitration under JAMS or other arbitration service.</p>\n<p>You can obtain AAA and JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows:</p>\n<p>AAA: 1.800.778.7879 or www.adr.org<br>JAMS: 1.800.352.5267 or www.jamsadr.com</p>\n<p>All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing.\nIf the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $250,000, an arbitration hearing will be conducted, at your election, either by telephone (or other mutually agreeable remote technology) or in City and County of San Francisco, California.\nIf the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $250,000, the arbitration will be conducted in the City and County of San Francisco, California.\nYou and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator's fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules (including any rules regarding hardship).\nbut if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Linden Lab to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this arbitration provision to be enforceable, or if the arbitrator(s) determine that you would experience an extreme hardship by paying your share of arbitration fees and costs prior to resolution of the Dispute, then Linden Lab will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration.\nDiscovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules.\nThe arbitrator's decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award (if any) may be entered in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration Act.\nThe arbitrator must honor the terms of this Agreement (and any Additional Terms) and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys' fees) consistent with applicable law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.2 Exceptions to Requirement to Arbitrate.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.1, either party may seek judicial relief from any court of competent jurisdiction (a) to enforce an arbitral award issued hereunder, (b) to compel arbitration required hereunder or (c) to obtain temporary injunctive relief to prevent imminent and irreparable harm or to preserve the status quo until an arbitrator can be empaneled and determine whether to continue, terminate or modify any such relief.\nIn the event of a request for temporary injunctive relief, the requirement for 60 days' dialogue before an arbitration can be initiated shall not apply.</p>\n<p>As set out in Section 10.1, in the event a court or arbitrator determines that the limitation of the arbitration to Dispute(s) between you and Linden Lab (prohibiting class or representative proceedings) is unenforceable, the Dispute then must be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts of San Francisco County, California.</p>\n<p>Return to top</p>11.\nGENERAL PROVISIONS<p>\n<strong>11.1 The Service is a United States-based
