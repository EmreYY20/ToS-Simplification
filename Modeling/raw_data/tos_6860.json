the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nThe arbitration will be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes.\nYour rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury.\nArbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by the court.<br>\u200d</li>\n<li>You and Salad Tech must abide by the following rules: <br>\u200d<br>1.\nANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR US MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES\u2019 INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE &nbsp.\nPROCEEDING;<br>2.\nTHE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON\u2019S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF;<br>3.\nthe arbitrator will honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law;<br>4.\nthe arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award;<br>5.\nthe arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law.\nand<br>6.\neach side pays its own attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses, and then in such instances, the fees and costs awarded will be determined by applicable law.<br>\u200d</li>\n<li>If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the balance of this arbitration provision will remain in effect and will be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.\nIf for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute will be exclusively brought in state or federal court in New York County, New York.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing herein shall be deemed as preventing Salad Tech from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights.<br>\u200d</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out.&nbsp.\n</strong>Notwithstanding the above, you or Salad Tech may choose to pursue a claim or dispute in court and not by arbitration if:<br>\n<br>1.\nthe claim or dispute qualifies, it may be initiated in small claims court.\nor<br>2.\nYOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the \u201cOpt-Out Deadline\u201d).\nYou may opt out by emailing a written notification to Salad Tech at support@salad.com.\nYour written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Salad Tech through arbitration.\nYour decision to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with Salad Tech.&nbsp;<strong> Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your claim or dispute in arbitration or small claims court.<br>\u200d</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Jury Waiver.\nYou understand and agree that by entering into this Agreement you and Salad Tech are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court.\nIn the absence of this Section, you and Salad Tech might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring claims or disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions).\nExcept as otherwise provided herein, those rights are waived.\nOther rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited or may also be waived.<br>\u200d</li>\n<li>Continuation.&nbsp.\nThis Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\nHowever, notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if Salad Tech makes any change to this Section (other than a change to the notice address) after the time in which you create your Account, you may reject any such change and require Salad Tech to adhere to the language in this Section as of the date your Account was created.<br>\u200d</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Survival</strong>.\nProvisions of this Agreement that by their nature or terms are intended to survive expiration or termination, will survive including without limitation those relating to indemnity, disclaimers and limitations of liability.<br>\u200d</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Assignment.</strong> &nbsp;This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Salad Tech without restriction.\nAny attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.<br>\u200d</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Entire Agreement, Waiver, Relationship.\n</strong> This Agreement is the entire agreement between Salad Tech and you regarding your use of the Platform and supersedes any prior agreements or understandings.\nNo waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be deemed a continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision, and our failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.\n&nbsp;Nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to create an agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchisor-franchisee relationship of any kind between us and you or any other person or entity, nor does this Agreement extend rights to any third party except as explicitly stated herein.<br>\u200d</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Electronic Communications and Notice.\n</strong> &nbsp;Communications with you via the Platform use electronic means, whether you visit the Platform or send us an email, or whether we post notices on the Platform or communicate with you via email or text.\nYou consent to receive communications from us electronically.\nYou agree that all terms and conditions and agreements can be entered into and signed electronically in accordance with applicable law, and all notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such notice or other communications be in writing.<br>\u200d</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Severability.&nbsp.\n</strong>If any provision of these Terms is deemed unenforceable, the enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and such provision shall be deemed to be restated to reflect the parties\u2019 original intentions as nearly as possible in accordance with applicable laws.<br>\u200d</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Changes to These Terms</strong>.<strong>&nbsp.\n</strong>We may change these Terms and the other documents that are part of the Agreement at any time, as we reasonably deem appropriate.\nUpon any such change, we will post the amended terms on the Platform.\nwe may also attempt to notify you in some other way including by email to the email address listed in your Account.\nYour continued use of the Platform following such posting shall constitute your affirmative acknowledgement of the applicable Agreement document, as amended.\nAny significant changes to this Agreement will be effective 30 days after posting such notice.\nIF AT ANY TIME YOU CHOOSE NOT TO ACCEPT ANY TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING FOLLOWING ANY SUCH MODIFICATIONS HERETO, THEN YOU MUST STOP USING THE PLATFORM.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol> ", "created_at": "2022-11-14 06:47:31.579027", "updated_at": "2022-11-14
