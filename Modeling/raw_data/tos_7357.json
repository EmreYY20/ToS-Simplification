section applies only to United States residents.\nIt describes how we collect, use and share Personal Information of United States residents in operating our business, and their rights with respect to that Personal Information.\nFor purposes of this section, \u201c<strong>Personal Information</strong>\u201d has the broadest interpretation of that term or any analogous term in any of the California Privacy Rights Act, Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, Colorado Privacy Act, Utah Consumer Privacy Act, and Connecticut Data Privacy Act.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your privacy rights.</strong> Depending on your state of residence, you may have the rights listed below.\nHowever, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline your request as permitted by law.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Information.</strong> You can request the following information about how we have collected and used your Personal Information during the past 12 months:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The categories of Personal Information that we have collected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The categories of sources from which we collected Personal Information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The business or commercial purpose for collecting and/or selling Personal Information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The categories of third parties with whom we share Personal Information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Whether we have disclosed your Personal Information for a business purpose, and if so, the categories of Personal Information received by each category of third-party recipient.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Whether we\u2019ve sold your Personal Information, and if so, the categories of Personal Information received by each category of third-party recipient.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Access/Data Portability.</strong>&nbsp;You can request a copy of the Personal Information that we have collected about you during the past 12 months, including in a format that is easily understandable and, to the extent technically feasible, in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Deletion.&nbsp;</strong>You can ask us to delete the Personal Information that we have collected from you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Opt-out of Sales.</strong> In conducting the Service, we do not \u201csell\u201d your Personal Information in the traditional sense of transferring Personal Information in return \u201cfor monetary or other valuable consideration\" without your specific consent or instruction.\nWe may share identifying information and performance data about your system to developers using our API, or to users of the Enphase App, upon your written consent.\nBecause your consent and actions in relation to those developers/users are a deliberate interaction directing us to provide this information to the developer/user we do not consider this sharing a \u201csale,\u201d but because we are not always privy to the consent that you provide the developer/user or the nature of those interactions, in some cases our transfer of data may be classified as a \u201csale\u201d under law.\nWe also may provide your personal information to installers or their partners for the purpose of introducing that installer or partner to you, but only when you consent or instruct us to do so.\nAdditionally, in certain circumstances, for example when the installer of your existing system is no longer available, we will pass on your contact information and site information to a follow-on installer to service your system at your direction.\nYou may nonetheless submit a request to opt-out.\nIn addition, if you direct us not to sell your Personal Information, we will consider it a request pursuant to California\u2019s \u201cShine the Light\u201d law to stop sharing your personal information covered by that law with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Opt-out of Sharing.</strong>&nbsp;We use certain advertising services that help deliver an improved advertising experience to you, such as providing interest-based ads to you.\nWe allow these services to collect information from our website users (specifically, online identifiers and browsing activity) and they use this data to serve interest-based ads to you.\nYou may submit a request to opt-out of such sharing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Correction.</strong>&nbsp;You may request that we update or correct inaccuracies in your Personal Information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Appeal.</strong>&nbsp;If we decline to take action on your data subject request for any reason, we will provide you a written statement of the reasons why.\nyou are entitled to an appeal by contacting us with information relevant to the issue, or by contacting your state Attorney General or other privacy protection agency, which may take up the matter depending on your state of residence.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Nondiscrimination.</strong>&nbsp;You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination in the form of legally prohibited increases in the price or decreases in the quality of our Service.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>How to Exercise Your Rights</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may exercise your privacy rights by any of the methods listed in the \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d section above.</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to confirm your residence to process your requests and will need to confirm your identity to process your requests to exercise your information, access/data portability, or deletion rights.\nWe generally seek to validate your request without collecting any additional personal information and seek to rely for example on information we already have in our possession -- the email address from which you sent the request and/or a recent months\u2019 energy usage.\nConsistent with law, you may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf.\nTo designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, you must provide a valid power of attorney, the requester\u2019s valid government-issued identification, and the authorized agent\u2019s valid government-issued identification.\nWe cannot process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to understand and respond to it.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Personal Information that We Collect, Use and Share</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The chart
