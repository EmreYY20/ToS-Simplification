<p>We learn information about you when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You give it to us directly (e.g., when you register for an account);</li>\n<li>We collect it automatically through our products and services (e.g., when you log in to Amara.org);</li>\n<li>Someone else tells us information about you (e.g., when subtitles created by an user on Amara.org contain a reference to you).\nor</li>\n<li>When we try and understand more about you based on information you\u2019ve given to us (e.g., when we use your IP address to customize language for some of our services).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> What do we do with your information once we have it? <p>When you give us information, we will only use it in the ways for which you have given us permission.\nGenerally, we use your information to help us provide and improve our products and services for you.\nFor example, when you link a third party platform account (eg.\nVimeo or YouTube), we only share information necessary to link your account.\nWe may occasionally contact you with information about our products or services.\nWe will never sell your personal information.\nYou have the right to access your personal information and/or delete it from our services.\nplease contact us if you require assistance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> When do we share your information with others?
