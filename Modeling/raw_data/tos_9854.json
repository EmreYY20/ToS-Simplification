Larian Studios (hereinafter the \"Distributor\"), a limited Belgian company registered in De Panne under the number B 438 915 415.\n</p>\n<p>The Service consists in the digital delivery of video games and all associated content needed to install and run the said games (serial number or activation key and data files: no physical back-up, notably CD-rom or DVD-rom will be sent (hereinafter \"the Games\" or the \"Video Games\")).\n</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the Service can also carry, under similar conditions, other products.\nThese Terms and Conditions apply in the exact same way to all the other products.\n</p>\n<p>2.\n- Prerequisites: </p>\n<p>2.1 - Internet Access: The Games available to download range from dozens of megabytes to many gigabytes in size: it is therefore recommended that the Customer has a broadband internet connection, either ADSL or cable.\nAn internet access is also required to install and launch the downloaded Games, or, depending on the Games, to reach some dedicated features (multiplayer sessions, etc...).\n</p>\n<p>2.2 Account: To use the Service, you will need to create an account and you will be required to supply valid information including a valid email address.\nIncorrect details may result in the rejection of your order.\n</p>\n<p>2.3 - Computer: The Games require a clean computer, with system specifications fulfilling a certain number of requirements (CPU power, RAM, GPU...): these specifications are indicated online on a Game per Game basis.\nIt is the Customer's responsibility to check that their computer fulfills the minimum requirements to run each Game.\nIf in doubt about the specifications, please refer to article 5 - Customer Service and ask our customer service.\n</p>\n<p>The Distributor will not be held responsible for misuse of the downloaded Games, nor for their compatibility with the Customer's computer.\n</p>\n<p>3.\n- Price &amp.\nPayment: </p>\n<p>The prices of Games advertised for sale on the Site are as set out on the Site, errors and omissions excepted.\nPrices may change at any time prior to acceptance of Customer's order.\n</p>\n<p>There are orders for Games that have not yet become available.\nFor some Games, Customers will be able to make a pre-released order or a pre-load order using the Site.\nRelease dates are set by the publishers and are subject to change.\nAs a result, the Distributor is not liable for any changes to a pre-release date.\n</p>\n<p>Pre-release, pre-load or download orders will be supplied at the price applicable at the time of order and the sale is said to have taken place once the Customer obtained the payment confirmed page and received a confirmation email.\n</p>\n<p>No bank or card details are visible by, nor stored by the Distributor or on the Site.\nIn order to fight mounting internet fraud, the Distributor collects and records certain device identifying information such as IP addresses, as well as other non-personally identifiable information.\nIn addition, the Distributor has contracts in place with certain third party service providers and shares such nonpersonally identifiable information with them to provide the safest user experience.\nThis unique official identification contractually binds you.\nIn the absence of fraud this information will remain confidential.\n</p>\n<p>4.\n- Customers Rights &amp.\nObligations: </p>\n<p>4.1 - Customer ID: the Customer is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of his accounts' login and password, and is fully responsible for all activities that occur under this account.\n</p>\n<p>The Distributor reserves the right to suspend or terminate any account if it is or appears to be used in breach of any of the provisions of these Terms &amp.\nConditions, including the provision of false registration details or any other misuse of the Site.\nAny person who holds such a suspended or terminated account must not re-register on the Site without the Distributor's prior consent.\n</p>\n<p>In the event of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security, the Customer must notify the Distributor immediately by contacting customer services.\n</p>\n<p>Note about Phishing (the criminally fraudulent process of attempting to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords and credit card details): The Distributor will never ask the Customer to divulge his password.\nSuch a request would be a fraud attempt by a third party.\n</p>\n<p>4.2 Game Delivery: The Customer can access the Games' data files and all associated content needed to install and run said Games (e.g.\nserial number or activation key) once the payment has been validated.\nIn order to fight fraud, the Distributor may refuse or delay the delivery of some or all of this associated content should the payment not be validated.\nIf a Customer is waiting for a Game delivery, he may contact the customer service in order to speed the payment validation process up.\n</p>\n<p>4.3 - Right of Cancellation: the Customer may cancel his order at any stage before the Service is delivered.\nThe Service is delivered once the Customer has received the downloadable links and/or any serial numbers either on the receipt page or via confirmation email.\n</p>\n<p>4.4 - Distributor cancellation &amp.\nrefund policy: Once a Customer downloads and activates a Game, the sale is deemed final, and no returns will be accepted by the Distributor.\n</p>\n<p>Video Games for which the Customer has received downloadable links and/or any serial numbers are non-refundable, whether based on technical failure of the Game, Customer inability to meet requirements to run the Game on the Customer's computer or lack of enjoyment while playing the Game.\n</p>\n<p>Refunds may be offered if all the following conditions are met: </p>\n<p>-The time of the Customer's request for refund/credit is less than 48 hours since the Service started.\n</p>\n<p>-The Game has not been activated or launched.\n</p>\n<p>-The Game serial numbers (activation key, multiplayer key, bonus key...) have not been transmitted and/or disclosed by the Customer to any third party.\n</p>\n<p>-Customer service has determined the Customer's refund request reasonable under special circumstances.\n</p>\n<p>Customer service will determine if a Customer meets the foregoing criteria for a refund.\nIf a Customer feels he is qualified for a refund, he will have to contact Customer service.\n</p>\n<p>4.5 - License of Use: The payment and download of Video Games gives the Customer an individual license that is non-exclusive for the use of the video game purchased, for a purely private, nontransferable and non-commercial use.\nThe Customer commits to using the Game following the Publisher's End User License as provided during installation and/or (depending on the Game) on the Site.\n</p>\n<p>In consequence, the Customer is forbidden from modifying, decompiling, translating, adapting and/or copying the downloaded game(s) in any way, except to create a copy onto a CD or DVD-rom or any other support for personal archiving.\n</p>\n<p>The distribution of non-authorized copies to third parties over the internet or any other network prevents the development of distribution by download and prevents the right holders from any remuneration which would be used for the creation of subsequent Games.\nIn order to prevent fraud, the Customer may only install the Games on a limited number of machines (and reinstall a limited number of times) and/or, (depending on the Game), will have to create an account directly on the Publisher's site or any third party selected by said Publisher to launch or access dedicated features from the Game.\n</p>\n<p>In the event of problems arising from the reasonable re-installation of the game (loss, system alteration, etc.), please contact the customer service which may expand customer's rights after having analyzed any reasonable requests.\n</p>\n<p>5.\n- Customer Service: </p>\n<p>The Distributor provides assistance with the Service for any questions relating to the download of, the installation of or the payment of a Game.\n</p>\n<p>To receive assistance with the Service, Customers can go to the online support pages and, if they do not find the required answers, may contact the customer service using the contact form available on the Site.\n</p>\n<p>In order for customer service to satisfy any request, the Customer will be required to give information that was sent to them after the purchase (sale ID), accurate information about the issue encountered and about the Customer's computer environment.\n</p>\n<p>The Distributor is not responsible for any issues linked to the Game itself.\nThese issues are the Game Publisher's responsibility only.\nThe Distributor may provide links to the Game Publisher's customer support or technical FAQ pages if and when available.\n</p>\n<p>6.\n- Service Availability: </p>\n<p>The Distributor commits to putting in place all the means at its disposal to ensure continued access to its Service.\nHowever the Distributor cannot guarantee the speed of download of the games, as such things are the responsibility not only of the Service but are characteristics inherent to the Internet or the delivery of a third party's service, notably those of the Internet Service Providers (ISPs).\n</p>\n<p>The Service runs via a technological environment that is under the management and the responsibility of the Customer, the Distributor is not responsible for any problems arising from this environment.\n</p>\n<p>Apart from that which concerns the Service provided, and aside from the momentary degradation of the quality of the Service, notably in the event of maintenance, repair, re-enforcement, extension or improvement of the Service, the Distributor will not, in any event, be responsible for the reliability of the
