Recipients\nReason for sharing <strong>Third party applications and devices you connect to your Spotify Account</strong> If you connect your Spotify account to a third party application and/or device(s), such as, social media, audio, television, or automotive platforms and services, Spotify shares technical data with the operator of that third party application and/or device in order to connect your Spotify account, and/or facilitate playback of the Spotify Service.\nWith respect to certain third parties which may request or require that we share your information with them, your permission will be requested before we provide your information to such third parties.\n<strong>Support community</strong>\nWhen you register for a Spotify Support Account on the Spotify Support Community, we will ask you to create a specific Spotify Support Community username.\nThis will be publicly displayed to anyone who accesses the Spotify Support Community along with any questions or comments you post.\n<strong>Your Spotify followers</strong>\nThere may be times when you want us to share information about your use of the Spotify Service with other Spotify users known as \u2018Your Spotify Followers\u2019.\nFor example, you have the ability to make both private and public playlists.\nIf you share your private playlists with others, please be aware that the recipients of your private playlists can further share those playlists with others.\n<strong>Artists and record labels</strong>\nYou may choose to share personal data (for example, your email address) with artists, record labels, or other partners who may want to directly send you news or promotional offers.\nYou will always have the option to change your mind and withdraw your consent at any time.\n<p>Learn more about how to manage notifications, your publicly available information, and what you share with others in Section 3 \u2018Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control\u2019 of this Policy and on the Privacy Center.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Information we may share</em>\n</strong>\n</p> Categories of Recipients\nReason for sharing <strong>Service providers</strong> We work with service providers that work on our behalf which may need access to certain personal data in order to provide their services to us.\nThese companies include those we've hired to provide customer service support, operate the technical infrastructure that we need to provide the Spotify Service, assist in protecting and securing our systems and services, and help market Spotify\u2019s own products and services as well as partner products, services, events, and co-branded promotions in which Spotify is involved.\n<strong>Payment processors</strong>\nWe will share your personal data with our payment processors as necessary to enable them to process your payments, and for anti-fraud purposes.\n<strong>Advertising partners</strong>\nWe work with advertising partners to enable us to customize the advertising content you may receive on the Spotify Service.\nThese partners help us deliver more relevant ads and promotional messages to you, which may include interest based advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising), contextual advertising, and generic advertising on the Spotify Service.\nWe and our advertising partners may process certain personal data to help Spotify understand your interests or preferences so that we can deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you.\n<strong>Spotify partners</strong>\nDepending on how you sign up for the Spotify Service (e.g.\nthrough a third party service or a mobile provider), we share your Spotify username or other User Data as necessary to enable your account.\nWe may also share personal data with that third party about your use of the Spotify Service, such as whether and to what extent you have used the offer, activated a Spotify account, or actively used the Spotify Service.\nWe also may share your personal data in a pseudonymised format with our music industry partners to help them understand how the content they license to us is performing and to enable you to listen to streaming content via the Spotify Service.\n<strong>Academic researchers</strong>\nWe will share your personal data for activities such as statistical analysis and academic study but only in a pseudonymised format.\n<strong>Other Spotify group companies</strong>\nWe will share your personal data with other Spotify group companies to carry out our daily business operations and to enable us to maintain and provide the Spotify Service to you.\n<strong>Law enforcement and data protection authorities</strong>\nWe share your personal data when we in good faith believe it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation under applicable law, or respond to valid legal process, such as a search warrant, a court order, or a subpoena.\nWe also share your personal data where we in good faith believe that it is necessary for the purpose of our own, or a third party\u2019s legitimate interest relating to national security, law enforcement, litigation, criminal investigation, protecting the safety of any person, or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm, provided that we deem that such interest is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of your personal data.\n<strong>Purchasers of our business</strong>\nWe will share your personal data in those cases where we sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or prospective buyer.\nIn this situation, Spotify will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data and give you notice before your personal data is transferred to the buyer or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n7.\nData retention and deletion <p>We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes.\nWe keep some of your personal data for as long as you are a user of the Spotify Service.\nFor example, we keep your playlists, song library, and account information.</p>\n<p>If you request, we will delete or anonymise your personal data so that it no longer identifies you, unless we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain personal data, including situations such as the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit on your account or an unresolved claim or dispute we will retain the necessary personal data until the issue is resolved;</li>\n<li>Where we need to retain the personal data for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary personal data for the period required by applicable law.\nand/or,</li>\n<li>Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our users.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote> 8.\nTransfer to other countries <p>Spotify shares your personal data globally with Spotify group companies in order to carry out the activities specified in this Policy.\nSpotify may also subcontract processing to, or share your personal data with, third parties located in countries other than your country.\nYour personal data, therefore, may be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country.</p>\n<p>Personal data collected within the European Union and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to and processed by third parties located in a country outside of the European Union and Switzerland.\nIn such instances Spotify shall ensure that the transfer of your personal data is carried out in accordance with applicable privacy laws and, in particular, that appropriate contractual, technical, and organisational measures are in place such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission.</p>\n<p>For further details of the security measures we use to protect your personal data, please see Section 10 \u2018Keeping your personal data safe\u2019 of this Policy.</p> 9.\nLinks <p>We may display advertisements from third parties and other content that links to third-party websites.\nWe cannot control or be held responsible for third parties\u2019 privacy practices and content.\nIf you click on a third-party advertisement or link, please understand that you are leaving the Spotify Service and any personal data you provide will not be covered by this Policy.\nPlease read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal data.</p> 10.\nKeeping your personal data safe <p>We are committed to protecting our users\u2019 personal data.\nWe implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data.\nhowever, please note that no system is ever completely secure.\nWe have implemented various policies including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.</p>\n<p>Your password protects your user account, so we encourage you to use a strong password that is unique to your Spotify account, never share your password with anyone, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after having used the Spotify Service.</p> 11.\nChildren <p>With the exception of Spotify Kids, a separate Spotify application available in certain markets, the Spotify Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 years.\nThe Spotify Service is also not offered to children whose age makes it illegal to process their personal data or requires parental consent for the processing of their personal data under the GDPR or other local law.</p>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years or under the applicable age limit (the \u201cAge Limit\u201d).\nIf you are under the Age Limit, please do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us.</p>\n<p>If you are a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, please contact us using the \u2018Contact Us\u2019 form on the Privacy Center, and you may request exercise of your applicable rights detailed in Section 3 \u2018Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control\u2019 of this Policy.</p>\n<p>If we learn that we have collected the personal data of a child under the age of 13 years, we will take reasonable steps to delete the personal data.\nThis may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.</p> 12.\nChanges to this Policy <p>We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.</p>\n<p>When we make material changes to this Policy, we\u2019ll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the

you say, and other related information such as the content that was returned to you by Spotify.</p> What does Spotify do with the voice data it collects? <p>Spotify uses this data to recognise what you say, to understand you better and to help us provide a response or take an action.\nSpotify may also use and share this data in other ways, which are described in our Privacy Policy.\nFor example, using your data to improve voice functionality on Spotify, to develop new voice features, and to help us provide you with advertising that is more relevant to you.\nIt also includes sharing information, from time to time, with our service providers, such as cloud storage providers, to help provide voice functionality for Spotify.</p> Is Spotify recording all of my conversations? <p>No.\nSpotify will begin receiving your voice input data when you press the action button or say the wake word or (for voice ads) when you hear an audible tone, and continue until Spotify has processed your question or request.</p>\n<p>The device will always indicate to you when Spotify is receiving your voice input, for example with a visual indicator or an audible tone.</p>\n<p>When listening for the wake-word, Spotify listens in short snippets of a few seconds which are deleted if the wake-word is not detected.</p> How do voice ads work? <p>You can interact with some of the advertisements on Spotify using your voice.\nDuring a voice-enabled ad, you will hear a voice prompt followed by an audible tone.\nFor example, a voice-enabled ad for a new album might ask you to say \"Play now\" to hear that album.\nYou can read more about voice ads and turn them on or off at any time in your Spotify settings.</p>\n<p>For further information on Spotify's privacy practices and on your rights and choices, please read our Privacy Policy.</p> How do I turn off voice controls and voice ads? <p>You can turn off Spotify's access to your microphone on your device at any time using the operating system settings on the device or by muting the microphone on your device.\nYou can also turn off voice ads at any time in your Spotify settings.</p>\n<p>Spotify USA Inc.</p>\n<p>4 World

Spotify</li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify</li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify</li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you're sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.<br> Here we go...</p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (\"Spotify,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\").\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the \"Spotify Service\" or \"Service\"), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the \"Content\") you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.</p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the \"Agreements\").\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify's website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don't agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.</p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian's consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.</p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we'll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.</p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here's some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.</p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the \"Free Service.\" Other options require payment before you can access them (the \"Paid Subscriptions\").\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.</p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.</p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (\"Code\"), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.</p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a \"Trial\").\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.</p>\n<p>For some Trials, we'll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.</p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (\"Pre-Paid Period\").</p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.</p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.</p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.</p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, \"Access\").\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.</p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (\"Devices\").</p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (\"Spotify Brand Features\") are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.</p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.</p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library's license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.</p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (\"Third Party Applications\") and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.</p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (\"User Content\").\nFor the avoidance of doubt, \"User Content\" includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.</p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.</p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify's sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.</p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.</p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify's agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.</p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (\"Feedback\"), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.</p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any \"moral rights\" or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of

disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.<br> Further, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.</p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.</em>\n</p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.</p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn't stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).</p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person's claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.</p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") then in force (the \"AAA Rules\"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.</p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.</p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.</p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify's last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator's decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.</p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.</p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements,

The arbitrator has the authority to rule on all issues except that a court has exclusive authority to: (1) decide arbitrability, as well as scope, validity, and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement; (2) decide whether you and Spotify have complied with the pre-arbitration filing requirements (including the requirements described in the \u201cPre-arbitration notice of dispute and informal resolution period\u201d section below); (3) enforce the prohibition on class or representative actions; (4) enforce the provisions regarding mass arbitrations; and (5) enjoin an arbitration from proceeding if it does not comply with this Arbitration Agreement. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. The arbitrator can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorneys\u2019 fees and costs where allowable under applicable law), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.

In addition, this Arbitration Agreement does not stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"no-class-or-representative-proceedings-and-class-action-waiverno-class-or-representative-proceedings-and-class-action-waiver\"><a href=\"#no-class-or-representative-proceedings-and-class-action-waiver\"></a><strong>No class or representative proceedings and class action waiver</strong></h4>\n\n<p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER IN ARBITRATION OR LITIGATION ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, CONSOLIDATED, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph\u2019s limitations as to a particular claim for relief or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief) and all appeals have been exhausted or the decision is otherwise final, then the parties agree that such a claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court only after all other claims and requests for relief are arbitrated.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"pre-arbitration-notice-of-dispute-and-informal-resolution-periodpre-arbitration-notice-of-dispute-and-informal-resolution-period\"><a href=\"#pre-arbitration-notice-of-dispute-and-informal-resolution-period\"><strong>Pre-arbitration notice of dispute and informal resolution period</strong></a></h4>\n\n<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the Dispute (\u201c<strong>Notice</strong>\u201d) to the other. Notices to Spotify must be sent by email to <a href=\"mailto:legal@spotify.com\">legal@spotify.com</a>, and Notices to you must be sent to the email address associated with your Spotify account. All Notices must: (1) be personally signed by the party sending the Notice; (2) provide the relevant user\u2019s name, email address associated with the user\u2019s Spotify account, and Spotify username; (3) describe with specificity the nature and basis of the Dispute; and (4) set forth the alleged damage and harm suffered and the specific relief sought with a calculation for it.</p>\n\n<p>After a Notice containing all of the information required above is received, the parties agree to engage in good faith for a period of sixty (60) days in an effort to resolve the Dispute (this time period may be extended by agreement of the parties) (\u201c<strong>Informal Resolution Period</strong>\u201d). The party receiving the Notice may request a telephone or video settlement conference during the Informal Resolution Period in an effort to facilitate resolution of the Dispute (\u201c<strong>Informal Settlement Conference</strong>\u201d). The Informal Settlement Conference, if any, will take place at a mutually agreeable time, which can be after the sixty (60) day Informal Resolution Period if needed to accommodate the parties\u2019 schedules. During the Informal Settlement Conference, you and a Spotify representative must both personally participate in a good-faith effort to resolve the Dispute without the need to proceed with arbitration. Any counsel representing the parties also may participate. Personal participation in an Informal Settlement Conference will not be required if both you and Spotify agree in writing.</p>\n\n<p>The Notice, Informal Resolution Period, and Informal Settlement Conference are intended to give the parties a meaningful opportunity to resolve Disputes informally. If any aspect of this \u201cPre-arbitration notice of dispute and informal resolution period\u201d section has not been met, the parties agree that a court can enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration and, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator shall not accept or administer an arbitration nor demand fees in connection with such an arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party retains the right to raise non-compliance with the requirements of this section and seek appropriate relief in arbitration.</p>\n\n<p>Any applicable statute of limitations or contractual limitations period will be tolled for any claims and requests for relief set forth in a Notice from the date that either you or Spotify sends the other a fully complete Notice until: (1) thirty (30) days after completion of the Informal Resolution Period, if no Informal Settlement Conference is held; or (2) thirty (30) days after completion of the Informal Settlement Conference if an Informal Settlement Conference is held (\u201c<strong>Tolling Period</strong>\u201d).</p>\n\n<p>Neither you nor Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding until after the Tolling Period has ended.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"arbitration-rules-and-feesarbitration-rules-and-fees\"><a href=\"#arbitration-rules-and-fees\"></a><strong>Arbitration rules and fees</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Either you or Spotify may start arbitration proceedings. Any arbitration between you and Spotify will be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation (\u201c<strong>NAM</strong>\u201d) in accordance with their rules applicable to the nature of the Dispute, including the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings (\u201c<strong>NAM Rules</strong>\u201d), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. You and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement (despite the choice of law provision above). The NAM Rules, as well as instructions on how to file a demand for arbitration (\u201c<strong>Demand</strong>\u201d) with NAM, appear at <a href=\"http://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/\">www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/</a>. The Demand must attach the relevant Notice and be personally signed by the party initiating the arbitration (and their counsel, if represented).</p>\n\n<p>If NAM is unavailable, unwilling, or otherwise unable to administer an arbitration in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement, then another administrator that will do so will be selected by agreement of the parties. If the parties cannot agree, then they will jointly petition a court to appoint an administrator that will do so. To start an arbitration, the claimant shall send a copy of the Demand to NAM and the other party. If you initiate arbitration, you shall serve the Demand on Spotify via email at <a href=\"mailto:legal@spotify.com\">legal@spotify.com</a> and to Spotify\u2019s registered agent at CT Corporation System, 28 Liberty Street, New York, New York, 10005. If Spotify initiates arbitration, Spotify shall serve the Demand on you at the email address associated with your Spotify account. The claimant must certify in the Demand that the requirements set forth in the \u201cPre-arbitration notice of dispute and informal resolution period\u201d section above have been met, and must attach a copy of the Notice to the Demand.</p>\n\n<p>Each party retains the right to request a hearing in arbitration from the arbitrator. Any arbitration hearings will be conducted by phone or videoconference to the extent possible, but if the arbitrator determines that a hearing should be conducted in person, the locale for such hearing shall be in the county or parish where you reside or at another agreed upon locale.</p>\n\n<p>As in court, any counsel participating in an arbitration certifies that they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including a certification that the claim or the relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions available under the NAM Rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or applicable federal or state law against all appropriate represented parties and counsel.</p>\n\n<p>Spotify will pay all filing, administration, case-management, hearing, and arbitrator fees (\u201c<strong>Arbitration Fees</strong>\u201d) if it initiates an arbitration. If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding, the allocation and payment of Arbitration Fees will be governed by the NAM Rules, unless a different allocation is required by court order or for this Arbitration Agreement to be enforced. You and Spotify agree that arbitration should be cost effective for all parties. Either party may engage with the arbitration administrator around fee reductions and deferred payments.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may consider rulings in other arbitrations involving different users, but an arbitrator\u2019s ruling will not be binding in any proceeding involving different users. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve any disagreements as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits. An arbitration award that has been satisfied may not be filed or entered in court.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mass-arbitrationmass-arbitration\"><a href=\"#mass-arbitration\"><strong>Mass arbitration</strong></a></h3>\n\n<p>If you elect to have your claim addressed as part of a mass arbitration (defined below), you agree to the additional procedures set forth below.</p>\n\n<p>If twenty-five (25) or more claimants submit Notices or attempt to file Demands raising similar claims, are represented by the same or coordinated counsel (regardless of whether the Notices or Demands are submitted simultaneously), and the parties cannot resolve the cases during the Informal Resolution Period, all of the cases must be resolved in arbitration through staged sets of proceedings. You agree to this process even though it may delay the arbitration of your case.</p>\n\n<p>If these mass filing procedures apply to your case, the Tolling Period for your claims will be extended until your case is selected to proceed as part of a staged proceeding, withdrawn, opted out of arbitration (as set forth below), or otherwise resolved.</p>\n\n<p>First Stage: In the first stage, counsel for the parties shall each select twenty-five (25) cases per side (50 cases total) to be filed in arbitration and to proceed individually in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement, with each case assigned to a separate and different arbitrator (unless the parties agree otherwise). In the meantime, any remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any Arbitration Fees be assessed in connection with those cases unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After the first stage is completed, the parties shall engage in a global, non-binding, and confidential mediation of all remaining cases with a retired federal or state court judge, and Spotify shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee.</p>\n\n<p>Second Stage: If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the mediation, the parties shall repeat the same process except that fifty (50) cases shall be selected per side (100 cases total) to proceed individually in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement, with each case assigned to a separate and different arbitrator (unless the parties agree otherwise). After the second stage is completed, the parties will again engage in a global, non-binding, and confidential mediation of all remaining cases with a retired federal or state court judge, with the mediator\u2019s fee paid for by Spotify.</p>\n\n<p>If the parties are unable to resolve any remaining cases after a second global mediation session:</p>\n\n<p>Option One: You and Spotify may, separately or by agreement, opt out of arbitration and elect to have your case heard in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with these Terms. You may opt out of arbitration by providing an individual, personally signed notice of your intention to opt out of arbitration to Spotify via email at <a href=\"mailto:legal@spotify.com\">legal@spotify.com</a> within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the second global mediation session. Spotify may opt your case out of arbitration by sending an individual, signed notice of its intention to opt out of arbitration to your counsel via email no more than thirty (30) days following the expiration of your thirty (30) day opt-out period. Counsel for the parties may agree to adjust these deadlines.</p>\n\n<p>OR</p>\n\n<p>Option Two: If neither you nor Spotify elects to have your case heard in court consistent with Option One, then you agree that your case will be resolved through continuing staged proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining cases exceeds two hundred (200), then two hundred (200) cases shall be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsel for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. If the number of remaining cases is fewer than two hundred (200), then all of those cases shall be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. No more than five (5) cases within any set of two hundred (200) cases may be assigned to the same arbitrator to proceed individually, unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those cases unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the staged process above, the arbitrators for the cases are encouraged to resolve the cases within one hundred twenty (120) days of appointment or as swiftly as possible thereafter, consistent with fairness to the parties. If any case selected for a staged set of proceedings is withdrawn prior to the arbitrator\u2019s award (and without the consent of the other party), another case shall be selected to proceed individually in arbitration consistent with the process set forth above.</p>\n\n<p>A court of competent jurisdiction will have the authority to enforce this \u201cMass arbitration\u201d section and, if necessary, to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations or the assessment or collection of Arbitration Fees. This \u201cMass arbitration\u201d section is intended to be severable from the rest of this Arbitration Agreement. If a court decides that the staging process set forth in this \u201cMass arbitration\u201d section is not enforceable (and after exhaustion of all appeals), then all cases may be filed in arbitration, but the payment of Arbitration Fees will be assessed as the arbitrations advance and arbitrators are appointed, rather than when the arbitrations are initiated.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"enforceabilityenforceability\"><a href=\"#enforceability\"></a><strong>Enforceability</strong></h3>\n\n<p>If in the process of arbitrating or litigating a Dispute this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole, the parties agree that they may seek to resolve the Dispute in a U.S. small claims court or in the federal or state courts of New York, New York, consistent with the \u201cGoverning law, jurisdiction, and jury trial waiver\u201d section above. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each party may bring a Dispute against the other party only in an individual capacity and not participate as a plaintiff, claimant, or class member in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding.

About These Terms</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Under applicable law, you may have certain rights that can\u2019t be limited by a contract. These Terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"changeschanges\"><a href=\"#changes\"></a><strong>Changes</strong></h3>\n\n<p>We may make changes to these Terms (including any additional Spotify terms and conditions incorporated by reference herein) from time to time by notifying you of such changes by any reasonable means, including by posting the revised Terms on the applicable Spotify Service (provided that, for material changes, we will seek to supplement such notice by email, an in-service pop-up message, or other prominent notice within the Spotify Service, or other means). Your use of the Spotify Service following any changes to these Terms will constitute your acceptance of such changes. Premium Subscribers who do not wish to continue using the Spotify Service under the updated Terms must close their Spotify account prior to their renewal date or thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, whichever occurs first. If Spotify makes any material change to the Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the notice address), you may reject any such change by sending us a personally signed, written notice of your decision to opt out of those changes via email to <a href=\"mailto:tounotice@spotify.com\">tounotice@spotify.com</a>. This opt-out notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of when we notify users of the change and include: (1) your name, address, email address associated with your Spotify account, phone number, and Spotify username. Such an opt-out must be sent by you personally from your personal email address, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. The opt-out notice also must include a statement that you wish to reject the change to the Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of a material change to the Arbitration Agreement is not an opt-out of arbitration altogether. Even if you opt out of a material change to the Arbitration Agreement, you and Spotify agree that any Dispute will be determined by binding individual (not class) arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Agreement in effect immediately before any such opt-out.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"entire-agreemententire-agreement\"><a href=\"#entire-agreement\"></a><strong>Entire agreement</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Other than as stated in this section or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and Spotify, these Terms constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Spotify and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Terms, whether written or oral.
