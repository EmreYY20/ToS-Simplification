responsive action, should a data breach occur:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We will notify the users via email, within seven (7) business days;</li>\n<li>We will notify the users via in-site notification, within seven (7) business days.\nand</li>\n<li>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.\nThis principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<br>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>CAN-SPAM ACT</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The CAN-SPAM Act is
