prejudice to its other remedies under this EULA or otherwise.\nIf any part of this EULA is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.\nAny notices or other

Arbitration of Disputes\n<p>We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this EULA or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, \u201cDisputes\u201d) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding.\nYou

1-800-778-7879.\nA party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules.\nThe AAA provides a form

arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.</p>\nSection 23.4.\nArbitration Costs\n<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we won\u2019t seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous.\nIf we prevail in arbitration we\u2019ll pay all of our attorneys\u2019 fees and costs and won\u2019t seek to recover them from you.\nIf you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.</p>\nSection 23.5.\nInjunctive and Declaratory Relief\n<p>Except as provided in Section 23.2 above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim.\nTo the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.\nThe parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.</p>\nSection 23.6.\nClass Action Waiver\n<p>YOU AND ZAM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nFurther, if the parties\u2019 Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the

to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution and Arbitration section shall be null and void.</p>\nSection 23.7.\nSeverability\n<p>With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 23.6 (\u201cClass Action Waiver\u201d), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of this EULA is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this EULA will
