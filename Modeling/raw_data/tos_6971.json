using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you \u2013 you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app.\nYou\u2019re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way.\nYou\u2019re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn\u2019t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions.\nThe app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Godev.</p>\n<p>Godev is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible.\nFor that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason.\nWe will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you\u2019re paying for.</p>\n<p>The barq app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us.\nIt\u2019s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure.\nWe therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device.\nIt could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone\u2019s security features and it could mean that the barq app won\u2019t work properly or at all.</p>\n<p>Some of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share your content.\nYou have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you\u2019re free to choose the content that you want to provide.\nIf you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.\nWhen uploading your content to any of our services, you grant us a worldwide non-exclusive license to your

translating it</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights.\nIf you remove from our services any content that\u2019s covered by this license, then our systems will stop making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time.</p>\n<p>The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and

active internet connection.\nThe connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Godev cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don\u2019t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don\u2019t have any of your data allowance left.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply.\nAs a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges.\nIn using the app, you\u2019re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory

permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>\n<p>Along the same lines, Godev cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e.\nYou need to make sure that your device stays charged \u2013 if it runs out of battery and you can\u2019t turn it on to avail the Service, Godev cannot accept responsibility.</p>\n<p>With respect to Godev\u2019s responsibility for your use of the app, when you\u2019re using the app, it\u2019s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you.\nGodev accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>\n<p>At some point, we may wish to update the app.\nThe app is currently available on Android &amp.\niOS \u2013 the requirements for both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you\u2019ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app.\nGodev does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android &amp.\niOS version that you have installed on your device.\nHowever, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.\nUnless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end.\n(b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<strong>4.\nChanges to these Terms and
