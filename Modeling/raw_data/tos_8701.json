be rendered valid and enforceable while implementing, to the maximum extent possible, the original intent of such provision.\nIf such modification is not possible or allowed, then such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such unenforceability or invalidity without affecting the remainder of such provision or any other provisions in this Agreement.\n</p> Premium User Provisions <p> In addition to the above, the following provisions apply to you if you subscribe to the Premium portion of the Service (\u201cPremium Service\u201d): </p> Subscribing to the Premium Service <p> You may not use the Premium Service without a valid subscription from Morningstar \u2014 at which point you will be deemed a \u201cPremium Member\u201d.\nTo obtain a subscription, you must register for the Premium Service either by completing and submitting the online registration form available for the Premium Service or by calling the toll-free number listed below under \u201cCustomer Service and Product Support\u201d and providing Morningstar with all of the required enrollment information.\nYour subscription will not be valid unless and until Morningstar accepts your completed registration.\nBy registering for the Premium Service, you represent and warrant that all registration information that you provide is true, complete, and accurate, and you agree to notify Morningstar promptly of any changes to this registration information.\nThis notification can be effected either by editing your user profile in the Service or by calling the toll-free number listed below under \u201cCustomer Service and Product Support.\u201d </p> AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OF PREMIUM SERVICE <p>\n<strong>You may be offered a free trial subscription to the Premium Service and this free trial subscription will normally begin on the date on which Morningstar accepts your completed registration.\nUnless cancelled by you or Morningstar during this trial period, the initial term of your regular paid Premium Service subscription will start immediately after the free trial period ends, and will continue for the length of time that you selected when you registered.\nIf you have ever taken a free trial to the Premium Service, you will not be eligible to receive another free trial.\nInstead, the initial term of your Premium Service subscription will begin immediately upon Morningstar accepting your registration and your credit card will be charged for the subscription fee associated with the term length you selected when you registered.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>In those instances where you subscribe to the Premium Service using a special or introductory offer, unless you notify us that you wish to cancel your Premium Service subscription before the end of its initial term, your Premium Service subscription will automatically renew for the period of time specified in that offer and your credit card will be charged the subscription fee in effect at the time for that subscription term length.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Other than as described elsewhere in this section, unless you notify us that you wish to cancel your Premium Service subscription before the end of its then-current subscription term, your Premium Service subscription will continue to automatically renew for successive terms of the same duration and your credit card will be charged for each such renewal at the subscription fee in effect at the time of that renewal.</strong>\n</p> Changes to the Premium Service <p> MORNINGSTAR RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CHANGE THE PREMIUM SERVICE AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ADDING OR REMOVING FEATURES).\nIF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY SUCH CHANGES, OR IF YOU ARE OTHERWISE DISSATISFIED WITH THE PREMIUM SERVICE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITS PERFORMANCE OR AVAILABILITY), YOUR ONLY REMEDY IS TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, AS SET FORTH BELOW.\n</p> Charges and Billing Practices <p> Premium Service subscription Fees on credit-card transactions are authorized immediately, but not actually processed until any applicable limited time free trial period has expired.\nSubscription fees will be based upon the subscription rates in effect at the start of each subscription term and apply whether or not you actually use the Premium Service during that term.\nYou can always find the current retail subscription rates by reviewing the Member Benefits on the Service.\n</p>\n<p> Morningstar reserves the right to change the fees it charges for products, services or features (collectively, \u201cProducts\u201d) offered in connection with the Premium Service and/or the Service at any time.\nThese sorts of changes include, but are not limited to, adding fees for new/optional Products and/or modifying fees for existing Products.\nBy using any of the Products, with which there are associated fees, you agree to pay those fees.\nIf you do not want to pay these associated fees, you must cancel your subscription, as set forth below.\nFor absence of doubt, if Morningstar increases the base Premium Service subscription fee at some point during your then-current subscription term, that increased fee will only apply to you upon the next renewal, if any, of your Premium Service subscription.\n</p>\n<p> Subscription fees and all others fees and charges associated with your Premium Service subscription (including, but not limited to, any applicable federal, state, and local taxes) will be billed automatically to the credit card you provide when registering for the Premium Service (\u201cyour credit card\u201d).\nIf your credit card is a VISA or MasterCard and the number or expiration date for your credit card changes for any reason (for instance, you get a new number because your old card expired, was stolen,

originally furnished by you.\nTo learn more about this pass-along service being provided by your credit card issuer, please contact it directly.\n</p>\n<p> While you are a Premium Subscriber, you must

reason.\nAbsent such notification, Morningstar will assume that all of the information related to your credit card remains valid and will submit to the card processor all information that it requires for approval, both when you initially subscribe and, if applicable, upon the commencement of any renewal of that subscription.\nIf any subscription fees or other charges billed to your credit card are declined for any reason, Morningstar shall have the right to suspend your subscription until such subscription fees or other charges are paid in full.\nYou agree to pay all costs (including

ends.\n</p>\n<p> Morningstar may at any time immediately cancel your subscription, without notice or liability, if it determines in its sole discretion that: (i) you have breached any portion of this
