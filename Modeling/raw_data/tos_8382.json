customer complaint handling, maintenance, software and system updates, user identification, as well as for problem diagnosis and repair purposes.\nThe aforementioned processing of your personal data is based on your contract with us.</p>\n<p>In addition, we use your personal data for the following purposes based on legitimate interests:</p>\n<p>Search functionality</p>\n<p>To enable the search functionality, we need to process the following data: your language settings, region, device screen size, time zone, search queries, and query IDs.\nWhen you make a search, we never link or associate the search query to you as a specific user.\nEach search query you make is collected and stored with a unique random identifier that Petal Search creates for the search query.</p>\n<p>We use your language settings, region, time zone, and device screen size to customize the search results that you receive.\nWe will use your approximate location (accurate to a specific city) based on your IP address to localize the results.\nIf you have enabled location-based services by giving location permission for Search, the search results may be tailored based on your precise location.</p>\n<p>We may predict your search intents using keywords identified in your search queries.\nFor example, if you enter the name of a movie, we may predict that you are searching for a video and therefore display videos in the search results.\nThe intent categories include \"people\", \"location\", \"music\", \"animal\", \"plant\", \"video\", and \"video artist\".\nYour search intents are not linked to you as a specific user but instead to a random query identifier in order to protect your privacy when using Petal Search.</p>\n<p>Search suggestions</p>\n<p>We analyze keywords derived from your search queries to derive top keywords used by our users.\nSuch analysis is done on an aggregated basis and we do not link or associate the keywords to you as a specific user.\nSuch processing enables us to provide you with search recommendations and real-time search suggestions as well as hot content (such as trending news and persons) in Petal Search.\nIn practice, we calculate which search keywords are most common and which results (for example, in relation to certain news and persons) are clicked the most.\nFor this purpose, we may collect the following data: search keywords and their respective user count, search language, and region.\nThe keywords are collected and stored with a random identifier to preserve your privacy when using Petal Search.</p>\n<p>To provide you with the Recommended searches function, we may predict your search intents using keywords identified in your search queries.\nFor example, if you enter the name of a movie, we may predict that you are searching for a video and therefore display videos in the search results.\nThe intent categories include \"people\", \"location\", \"music\", \"animal\", \"plant\", \"video\", and \"video artist\".\nYour search intents are not linked to you as a specific user but instead to a random query identifier in order to protect your privacy when using Petal Search.</p>\n<p>We also use your language settings, region, time zone, and device screen size to customize the suggestions presented to you.</p>\n<p>By analyzing search keywords, we may predict your search intents and provide specific search results that you may be interested in, such as apps, weather, flights, hotels, sports information, and translation services.\nFor example, if you search for a specific name of a sports team or league, we may display relevant information about the team or league to you.\nIf your search contains a city name (e.g.\n\"from Madrid to Rome\", \"hotels in Rome\" or \"weather in Rome\"), we may display information regarding available flights to, hotels, and the weather in the city.\nSuch features may be provided in co-operation with our third-party partners.\nWe never share any data with such third-party partners which could be used to identify you as a specific user (we may only share general data, such as keyword from your query (e.g.\na name of a sports club or league), your current city, time, and language settings to allow you to use the features provided with such third-party partners).\nWhen you use such services provided by third parties (e.g.\nreserving a table on a restaurant page searched for using Petal Search or tracking a parcel by inputting a tracking code to your chosen carrier), or access them by using different links and shortcuts via Petal Search, the corresponding third party will provide the service to you and process your data in accordance with its privacy policy.</p>\n<p>Your individual search records will also be stored in your device, unless you have incognito mode enabled, to provide search suggestions based on your previous searches.\nYou can find and manage such records from Settings &gt.\nSearch history.</p>\n<p>Service improvement</p>\n<p>In order to improve the quality of our search service (e.g.\nimprove our search algorithms), we will store the URLs of the search results you select, and analyze the types of queries you make and the search results you select.\nWe do not link or associate search result URLs to you as a specific user.\nThe URLs are collected and stored with a random identifier to preserve your privacy when using Petal Search.\nFor similar service improvement purposes, we will also process various service usage events (e.g.\nbuttons and titles that you touch, search result ratings you give, and comments you make), and we will link those events to the random identifier.</p>\n<p>News</p>\n<p>The news function may be provided in collaboration with our partners.\nIn order to provide local news for you, we need to process information about the news channel and your language and region settings, and share the information with our news partners.</p>\n<p>User statistics</p>\n<p>We generate statistical and business insights using general data about Petal Search users (such as how many users make the same search).\nSuch analysis of our users, which is always conducted on an aggregated basis, enables us to understand our users better and to improve the quality and user experience of our current and future services and offerings.</p>\n<p>Such general data includes the channel name (such as \"news\"), channel ID (such as \"10\"), search duration, ID of the search index and search result page, search language, returned URL list, selected URLs, and search region.\nThe data is collected and stored with a random identifier to preserve your privacy when using Petal Search.</p>\n<p>Advertisements</p>\n<p>We may use your search queries to provide contextual advertisements based on automatically-identified keywords in your queries.\nThis enables us to show you advertisements that are relevant to you.\nFor example, if your search query includes \"hotel\" we may show you advertisements relating to hotels.\nWe will use your approximate location (accurate to a specific city) based on your IP address to localize the ads.\nIf you have enabled location-based services by giving location permission for Search, the ads may be tailored based on your precise location.</p>\n<p>In addition, we collect information about how you select and view advertisements for the purpose of settlement with our advertisement partners.\nSuch data is always aggregated and abstracted.</p>\n<p>We never link or associate your search queries or any subsequent clicks to you as a specific user.\nSuch information is collected and stored with random identifiers (e.g.\nab7221ca3d9f4a43a425ce1e5b85c13), which are created uniquely for each search query and subsequent delivery of advertisements by Petal Search.</p>\n<p>Security and fraud prevention</p>\n<p>We will collect your IP address with a random identifier in order to detect possible fraudulent behavior (such as the use of automatic ad clicker bots) and to safeguard our advertisement partners from being unfairly charged.</p>\n<p>We may also process the IP address, mouse activities on the page, browser or browsing simulator information (such as type and version, operating system, active plug-ins, time zone, language, font, screen resolution), HTTP header, etc.\nfor the purpose of cyber security to identify malicious attacks.\nBy analyzing how users interact with our web pages we can detect and prevent cyber-attack by internet bots (e.g.\nan attacker using automatic software) or even human.\nOnly identified attack attempts are recorded by us.</p>\n<p>We also use log information, which may include search queries, for security purposes to provide you with secure and reliable services.</p>\n<p>In order to detect fraudulent use of our translation service (e.g.\nusing automatic software to perform a large amount of translation on the translation service), we process the total number of characters translated using Petal Search's translation function.\nTo conduct such processing, we do not store the text being translated.</p>\n<p>3 How Long Do We Store Your

(12) months from the date they were created, in order to ensure the effectiveness of our anti-fraud and security measures.\nOur logs may contain information about search queries, but they are not stored with any unique identifiers or other comparable data, so they are unable to identify a unique user.</p>\n<p>Once the retention period expires, we will delete or anonymize your personal data, unless otherwise required by applicable laws and regulations.</p>\n<p>Search result delisting requesters</p>\n<p>If you make a search result delisting request, we may store the request and the interaction records up to six (6) years from the closing of your removal request.\nWe will erase any copies of identification documents you have provided to us within three (3) months of closing your
