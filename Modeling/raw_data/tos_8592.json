governing the Promotion will prevail.</p>\n<strong>\u200d</strong>\n<strong>6.\nSubscriptions</strong>\n<p>Some Services are subject to payments.\nPaid Services are usually provided on a recurring subscription basis (\u201c<strong>Subscription(s)</strong>\u201d), but we may also provide them on a fixed-term basis (\u201c<strong>Fixed Term</strong>\u201d), or as one-time payment add-ons

right to terminate your Subscription in the event we are unable to collect a relevant payment from you (whether automatically or manually).\nWhere that happens, we will inform you of the termination of your Subscription via email.</p>\n<strong>\u200d</strong>\n<strong>7.\nFree Trial</strong>\n<p>We may, at our sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time

without providing a reason at any time within fifteen (15) days of the original date of purchase.\nAs your Purchase can be used by you immediately, we reserve the right to only issue a pro-rated refund which reflects the amount of time you have enjoyed the Purchase before claiming a refund.</p>\n<p>To request a refund (or partial refund), please contact us by using the contact details at the bottom of these Terms.\nWe will issue any refund as soon as possible to the payment method used for the original Purchase.</p>\n<p>Refunds do not apply to Business
