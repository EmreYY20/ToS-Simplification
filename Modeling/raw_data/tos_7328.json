Policy\n<p>\n<em>Last updated on 8th September 2022</em>\n</p>\n1.\nOverview\n<p>This Refund Policy describes our policies regarding the handling of refunds in general and does not serve as a legal

refund.</p>\n2.\nAcceptable Reasons\n<p>Listed below are possible reasons that might permit the initiation of a full or prorated refund.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Any kind of unauthorized transaction that was not undertaken on your behalf but financially affects you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Any situation in which you have not successfully received or are unable to access premium

reasons.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Any situation in which you actively or passively forgot to cancel your ongoing subscription.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Any further non-believable reason without feasible
