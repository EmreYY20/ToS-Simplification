Services, we passively collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which pages were visited, the order in which they were visited, and which links were \"clicked\".\nCollecting

advertisements.</p> Mobile Applications <ul>\n<li>On mobile applications, we use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Services on your phone.\nThis software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregate usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded

the setting at the device level.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Searchable Profiles - </strong>In the past, job seekers may have elected to make their profile searchable by our customers on a confidential basis only.\nDice no longer offers this feature for job seekers, but for those job seekers who had previously registered on this basis, the user's name and contact information will not be displayed to customers performing searches on the Sites.\nIf the customer desires to contact the confidential job seeker regarding an employment opportunity, they will send an email to the job seeker through our system.\nWe will forward the email to the seeker's email address.\nThe seeker's email address will not be provided directly to the customer.\nWhen posting a resume confidentially, it is the job seeker's responsibility to ensure that their contact information is not included within their resume attachment.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Children and Minors - </strong>Dice Services are not available to

at&nbsp;support@dice.com&nbsp;and we will make the change for them.</p> Sharing with Third Parties and Marketing Preferences <p>If you \"opt in\" to receive promotional materials from third parties, information you have made available to us may be made available to third parties who provide goods or services that we believe may be of interest to you.\nYou may \"opt out\" of receiving such materials at any time in a variety of ways: by using the \"opt-out\" link included in each email, by changing your subscriptions preferences on the \"user settings\" page in your Dice account or by

identified by you when collecting your personal information before or at the time of collection, or to which you separately consented.</p> Framing and Co-Branding <p>The Sites may utilize framing and masking techniques to make it appear that the user is still on the Site when the user is actually on a third-party website.\nWe also have co-branding relationships with certain partners.\nIn these relationships, you will notice our service platform on our partner's page.\nIn this situation, both parties are collecting your data and both privacy policies govern the data collected.\nWe will not

website that collects personal information.</p> Categories of Personal Information Shared with Third Parties within the Past Twelve Months <p>In the preceding twelve (12) months, we have disclosed the

whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Cookies <p>We use cookies on the Sites.\nA \"browser\" or \"HTTP\" cookie is a unique text file that may be used for data analysis, and enables a web site to tailor information presented to a user based on a user's browsing program.\nDice may use browser cookies to personalize a user's pages at our Sites, to remember a user when the user registers for products or services, for fraud prevention, or to track visits to our Sites.\nIf a user does not want Dice or its partners to deploy browser cookies in the user's browser when the user visits the Sites, the user may set the browser to reject cookies or to notify the user when a web site tries to place cookies in the browser program.\nRejecting cookies may affect a user's ability to use some of the products, features, functions, or services on our Sites.&nbsp;&nbsp;To adjust your cookies preferences, please click here.</p> Pixels <p>We use pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising.\nThese pixels are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick.\nThese files enable our ad management partner to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our Sites.\nThe information that we collect and share does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.</p>\n<p>For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to&nbsp;https://www.google.com/privacy/ads/&nbsp;or you may also opt out by clicking&nbsp;here.</p> Web beacons <p>We use web beacons from time to time.\nA web beacon is a string of code that provides a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data, or determining how many times a specific web page has been viewed.\nWeb beacons enable Dice to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits a Site, and to learn which banner ads bring users to each Site.\nFor example, when a user visits a web page, the code for the page may include instructions to go to another server to gather a single pixel graphic image.\nWeb beacons are not placed on a user's computer.\nSuch web beacons may be provided by Dice's third party advertising companies to help manage and optimize any online advertising.</p> Log files <p>Dice web servers may automatically log aggregate information, such as a user's IP address, domain name, browser type, date and time of access, and other log file data.</p>\n<strong>Advertisements </strong>\n<p>The ads appearing on the Sites may be delivered to visitors by third parties, such as Google.\nThe third party advertising technology that Dice uses on the Sites uses information derived from a user's visits to the Sites to target advertising within the Sites.\nIn addition, Dice's advertisers may use other third party advertising technology to target advertising on the Sites.\nIn the course of serving advertisements to the Sites, our partners may place or recognize a unique cookie on a user's browser.\nInformation about users' visits to the Sites, such as the number of times users have viewed an ad (but not users' names, addresses, or other personal information), are used to serve ads to visitors.\nThe use of cookies enables our partners to serve ads to users based on such user's visit to the Sites and other sites on the Internet.\nAs with other cookies, and consistent with Dice's policy on cookies stated above, the user may block or delete such cookies from the user's drive or memory.\nFor more information about Google, Google's use of cookies, and how to \"opt out\" of Google's email/information lists, please click here:&nbsp;http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html.</p> Advertising Choices <p>We partner with a third party to display advertising on our Sites.\nOur third-party partners may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.\nIf you would prefer to not receive personalized ads based on your browser or device usage, you may generally express your opt-out preference to no longer receive tailored advertisements.\nPlease note that you will continue to see advertisements, but they will no longer be tailored to your interests.</p>\n<p>To opt-out of interest-based advertising by participating companies in the following consumer choice mechanisms, please visit:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)'s self-regulatory opt-out page (optout.aboutads.info) and mobile

for, any of the third-party sites, their content or privacy practices.\nDice does not endorse or make any representations about the third-party sites, or any information, services, or products found on the sites.\nIf a user decides to access any of the linked sites, Dice encourages the user to read their privacy statements.\nThe user accesses such sites at user's own risk.</p> E.\nSecurity <p>The security of your personal information is important to us.\nWhen you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information.</p>\n<p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.\nNo method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.\nTherefore, we cannot guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our

choice.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Referrals</strong>&nbsp;- If you choose to use our referral service to tell another person about a job, we will ask you for that person's email address.\nWe will automatically send that person a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.\nWe use this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email, and do not store these email addresses.</p> G.\nSocial Media Features <p>The Sites include social media features, such as the Facebook like button and widgets that run on our Sites.\nThese features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Sites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial Media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on
