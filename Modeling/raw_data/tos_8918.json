SERVICE:</b>&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Description:&nbsp.\nVoIP services allow you to make or receive\ntelephone calls over the Internet to or from the public switched telephone\nnetwork.&nbsp.\nThe nature of VoIP telephone\ncalls, while appearing similar to traditional telephone calling services,\ncreate unique limitations and circumstances, and you acknowledge and agree that\ndifferences exist between traditional telephone service and VoIP telephone\nservices, including the lack of traditional 9-1-1 emergency services.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>9-1-1 service:&nbsp.\nBecause of the unique nature of VoIP\ntelephone calls, emergency calls to 9-1-1 through your VoIP service will be\nhandled differently than traditional telephone service.&nbsp.\nThe following provisions describe the\ndifferences and limitations of 9-1-1 emergency calls, and you hereby\nacknowledge and understand the differences between traditional 9-1-1 service\nand VoIP calls with respect to 9-1-1 calls placed to emergency services from\nyour account as described below.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Placing 9-1-1\ncalls:&nbsp.\nWhen you make a 9-1-1 emergency\ncall, the VoIP service will attempt to automatically route your 9-1-1 call through\na third-party service provider to a Public Safety Answering Point\n(\u201cPSAP\u201d).&nbsp.\nYour call may be forwarded to\na third-party specialized call center that handles emergency calls.&nbsp.\nThis call center is different from the PSAP\nthat would answer a traditional 9-1-1 call, and consequently, you will be\nrequired to provide your name, address, and telephone number to the call\ncenter.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>How your information is\nprovided:&nbsp.\nThe dispatcher receiving the\ncall will not be able to capture or automatically retain your name, telephone\nnumber, or physical location as this information is not provided by you to\nTextMe.&nbsp.\nTherefore, when making a 9-1-1\nemergency call, you must immediately inform the dispatcher of your location (or\nthe location of the emergency, if different), and any other relevant\ninformation as required by the dispatcher.&nbsp.\nIf you are unable to speak, the dispatcher may not be able to locate you\nif your location information is not up to date.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Disconnections:&nbsp.\nYou must not disconnect the 9-1-1 emergency\ncall until told to do so by the dispatcher, as the dispatcher may not have your\nnumber or contact information.&nbsp.\nIf you\nare inadvertently disconnected, you must call back immediately.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Connection time:&nbsp.\nFor technical reasons, including network\ncongestion, it is possible that a 9-1-1 emergency call will produce a busy\nsignal or will take longer to connect when compared with traditional 9-1-1\ncalls.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>9-1-1 calls may not\nfunction:&nbsp.\nFor technical reasons, the\nfunctionality of 9-1-1 VoIP emergency calls may cease or be curtailed in\nvarious circumstances, including, but not limited to:&nbsp.\nfailure of service or your service access\ndevice\u2014if your system access equipment fails or is not configured correctly, or\nif your VoIP service is not functioning correctly for any reason, including\npower outages, VoIP service outage, suspension or disconnection of your service\ndue to billing issues, network or Internet congestion, or network or Internet\noutage in the event of a power, network or Internet outage.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You may need to reset or\nreconfigure the system access equipment before being able to use the VoIP\nservice, including for 9-1-1 emergency calls.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Alternate services: TextMe\nrecommends that you terminate the VoIP services or consider an alternate means\nfor accessing traditional 9-1-1 emergency services.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Inform other users:&nbsp.\nYou are responsible for notifying, and you\nagree to notify, any user or potential users of your VoIP services of the\nnature and limitations of 9-1-1 emergency calls on the VoIP services as\ndescribed herein.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>&nbsp;</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>TEXTING SERVICE \u2013 TEXT-TO-911 LIMITATIONS</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>&nbsp;</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Note that most consumers in the U.S.\nCANNOT\naccess emergency 911 services by sending a text message from a phone.\nEven\nwhere it is possible to send a text message to emergency 911 services, it is\npreferable to place a call to emergency 911.\nEven if sending a text message to\nemergency 911 services is possible, the emergency call taker will not receive\nyour location information automatically.\ninstead, you will have to supply such\ninformation.\nIf you attempt to send a text message to 911 and it cannot be\nprocessed, you will receive a \u201cbounce back\u201d message that the text message was\nnot
