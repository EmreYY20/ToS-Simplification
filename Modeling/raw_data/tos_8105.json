Affiliate / Merchant Login Cookie Policy <strong>\nThe cookie policy of ProAffiliateSystem outlines the different types of cookies that may be used in relation to the Website https://proaffiliatesystem.com/, owned and administered by us, through which you have access to this Cookie Policy (the \"Website\"), as well as information on how you can control them.<br>\n<br>\nWhat are actually cookies?<br>\nCookies are small files, which are used for access to the Internet, that are stored on the computer, the mobile device, the tablet or other equipment of a given User.\nCookies are installed through a request by the server of a given web page to your web browser (i.e.\nInternet Explorer, Chrome, Safari, Mozilla) and are completely \"passive\" (they do not contain any software, viruses or spyware and do not have access to the information of the User hardware).<br>\n<br>\nWhat are cookies used for?<br>\nCookies are used in a way, allowing the Website to function better and more efficiently.\nCookies are needed in order for you to browse the Website and to use their services and functionalities.\nWithout those essential cookies, our Website will not function as fluently as we would like them to and we might not be able to provide you with certain services or features.<br>\nCookies are also used in order to prepare anonymous statistics, which aid us at understanding, how a given user prefers to use our Website, allowing us to improve its structure and contents, without identifying the user.\nThe ProAffiliateSystem Website may also use certain Wordpress features, software such as Google Analytics, Google Adsense or Google Adwords, Facebook, Twitter, Google+ or other social media \u201clike\u201d buttons or plugins, which contain cookies.<br>\n<br>\nWhat types of cookies do we use?<br>\nWe use two types of cookies \u2013 for the user session and fixed ones.\nThe former ones are temporary files, which remain on the device of the User until the end of his/her user session or until closing the web browser.\nThe fixed files remain on the device of the User for the period, specified in the cookies themselves or until deleted by the User.<br>\n<br>\nWhat are the purposes, for which we use cookies?<br>\n<u>Processes</u>:\tIntended to make the Website work in the way you expect.\nFor example, we use a cookie that tells us whether you have already signed up for a User Account.<br>\n<u>Authentication, Security and Compliance</u>:\tIntended to prevent fraud, protect your data from unauthorized parties, and comply with legal requirements.\nFor example, we use cookies to determine if you are logged in your User Account.<br>\n<u>Preferences</u>:\tIntended to remember information about how you prefer the services to behave and look.\nFor example, we use a cookie that tells us whether you have declined to allow us to use your phone\u2019s geolocation data.<br>\n<u>Notifications</u>:\tIntended to allow or prevent notices of information or options that we think could improve your use of the Service.\nFor example, we use a Cookie that stops us from showing you the signup notification if you have already seen it.<br>\n<u>Analytics</u>:\tIntended to help us understand how visitors use the services.\nFor example, we use a Cookie that tells us how our search suggestions correlate with your interactions with the search page.<br>\n<br>\nDo cookies contain personal data?<br>\nOn their own, cookies do not require personal information in order to be used and most often, they do not identify internet Users.\nThe personal data, collected during the usage of cookies can only be gathered in order to ease the use of the services by the User.\nThis data is encrypted in such a way that it does not allow unauthorized persons to gain access it.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Deleting the cookies</u>\n<br>\nIn general, applications for access to web pages (web- or mobile browsers) allow the storage of cookies by default.\nThese settings may be changed in such a way that the automatic administration of cookies is blocked by the web browser or that the User would be informed each time when cookies are sent to his/her device.\nDetailed information about the options and management of cookies may be found in the settings of the Web Browser.\nLimiting the usage of cookies may affect some of the features of the Website.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Security and confidentiality</u>\n<br>\nCookies are NOT viruses.\nThey take the form of simple text.\nThey are not made out of code and cannot therefore be executed or execute themselves alone.<br>Consequently, they may not be duplicated or copied into other networks in order to get started and copied once more.\nSince cookies cannot perform those functions, they cannot be regarded as viruses.<br>\nMost often, browsers have built-in privacy settings, which provide different levels for the acceptance of cookies, the period of their validity and their automatic deletion after a User has visited a given website.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Advice on secure and responsible surfing, using cookies</u>\n<br>\nThanks to their flexibility and the fact that many of the most visited and biggest websites use cookies, their use is almost inevitable.\nDeactivating cookies will not allow the access of a given user to many of the most commonly used websites, including YouTube, Yahoo, Gmail and others.<br>\n<br>\nHere is some advice, which can ensure safe surfing, but with the help of cookies:<br>\n\u2022 Personalize your cookie browser settings, in order to create an adequate level of protection from the use of cookies.<br>\n\u2022 If you are the only person, who uses the computer, you may set longer terms for expiration of the storage of the browsing history and access to personal data.<br>\n\u2022 If you share your computer access with somebody, you may set your browser settings to delete the surfing data every time you close your web browser.<br>\n\u2022 Ensure that your browser is always up to date.\nMany of the attacks, based on cookies, are realized when exploiting the weak spots of old and non-updated versions of the web browsers.\nCookies are everywhere and they may not be circumvented if you would like to enjoy your access to the best and biggest websites on the Internet.<br>\n<br>\nIt is possible that you set your browser in a way that does not allow for cookies to be accepted anymore or you can set your browser to accept cookies only from certain websites.\nAll modern browsers offer the option to change cookie settings.\nThis includes computer browsers, as well as mobile device browsers.\nThese settings can be found in the \"options\" menu or the \"preferences\" menu of your browser.\nIn order to find those settings, you can also use the links below or use the \"help\" menu of your browser for more information.<br>\n</strong>\n<ul>\n<u>Alternative</u>\n<li>Alternative to goaffpro</li>\n<li>Alternative to
