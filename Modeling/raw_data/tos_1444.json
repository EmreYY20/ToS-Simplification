of the dispute only through arbitration of that dispute in accordance with the terms of this Section 8, and not litigate any dispute in court.\nArbitration means that the dispute will be resolved by a

Arbitration Proceeding.\nSelection of Arbitrator.\nIf you or the Company elect to resolve your dispute through arbitration, the party initiating the arbitration proceeding must initiate it with the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d).\nThe terms of this Section 8 will govern in the event they conflict with the arbitration rules identified below.</li>\n<li>Arbitration Procedures.\nBecause the software and/or service provided to you by the Company concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) governs the arbitrability of all disputes.\nHowever, applicable federal or state law may also apply to the substance of any disputes.\nFor claims of less than $75,000, the AAA\u2019s Consumer Arbitration Rules shall apply.\nfor claims over $75,000, the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules and relevant fee schedules for non-class action proceedings shall apply.\nThe AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nFurther, if your claims do not exceed $75,000 and you provided notice to, and negotiated in good faith with, the Company as described above, and if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator, in addition to any rights to recover the same under controlling state or federal law afforded to the Company or you.\nThe arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.\nSuch award will be binding and final, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.</li>\n<li>Location of Arbitration.\nYou or the Company may initiate arbitration in either Orange County, California or the county in which you reside.\nIf you initiate arbitration in the county of your residence, the Company may transfer the arbitration to Orange County, California provided that the Company agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the change in location, as determined by the arbitrator.</li>\n<li>Severability.\nIf any clause within this Section 8 (other than the Class Action Waiver clause of Section 8.4) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Section 8 and the remainder of this Section 8 will be given full force and effect.\nIf the Class Action Waiver (Section 8.4) clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Section 8, except for this Section 8.8, will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court and IN THAT INSTANCE, YOU AND THE COMPANY EACH WAIVE AND AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY, TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW.</li>\n<li>Survival.\nThis Section 8 shall survive any termination of the Terms.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>General

requirement.\nExcept as expressly and specifically set forth in these Terms, no representations, statements, consents, waivers or other acts or omissions by the Company shall be deemed a modification of these Terms nor legally binding, unless documented in physical writing, hand signed by you and a duly appointed officer of the Company.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Notices.\nWe may notify you via postings on
