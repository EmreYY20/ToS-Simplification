PROVISIONS CAREFULLY, AS THEY AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>18.1.\nNotice.\nProcess</strong>\n<br>\nBefore filing a claim against us in any forum, you agree to first attempt to resolve the dispute informally by notifying us of your claim by sending an email to <strong>disputeresolution@publicstorage.com</strong> or sending a letter to the Dispute Resolution Department, 701 Western Avenue, Glendale, California 91201.\nThe notice must specifically describe the nature of the dispute and the relief you seek.\nYou will give us sixty (60) days from the date we receive your notice to try to resolve the dispute.\nEither party may file a claim if the dispute is not resolved after sixty (60) days.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>18.2.\nDispute Resolution and Arbitration</strong>\n<br>\nBoth you and Public Storage agree that any and all dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Public Storage arising in connection with or in any way relating to the relationship between you and Public Storage, including your use of the Public Storage online bill paying service, will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Public Storage further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nBy agreeing to arbitrate, both parties are giving up the right to proceed in court.\nArbitration is a method of claim resolution that is less formal than a traditional court proceeding.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as in court, except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>18.3 Arbitration Rules</strong>\n<br>\nThe arbitration will be governed and administered by the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.\n(<strong>\u201cJAMS\u201d</strong>) then in effect and as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes, who will be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS.\nTo the extent JAMS is not available in your state, the arbitration will be governed and administered by the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (<strong>\u201cAAA\u201d</strong>) then in force (the <strong>\u201cAAA Rules\u201d</strong>), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nFor all claims and counterclaims together valued at less than $25,000, you and Public Storage agree that arbitration must proceed as a documents-only hearing, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by both parties.\nYou and Public Storage agree that the right to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement is protected by, and any arbitration will be governed by, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1 et seq.).\nYou and Public Storage agree that our business and the relationship here involve interstate commerce.\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>18.4 Exceptions</strong>\n<br>\nNotwithstanding Section 18.2 above, both you and Public Storage agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to seek remedies in small claims court for disputes or claims within that court's jurisdiction.\nBoth parties also retain the right to pursue any eviction, action to enforce a lien, and/or unlawful detainer remedies or defenses in any court.\nYou agree that Public Storage retains the right to conduct a lien sale.\nFurther, this Arbitration Agreement does not stop you or Public Storage from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, who may seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa) to the extent allowed by law.\nAny other claims, however, such as claims for violations of the self-storage lien laws, derivative claims (including, but not limited to, claims under state consumer protection statutes), conversion, negligence, breach of contract, or other violations of state or federal law, must be brought in arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>18.5 No Class or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver</strong>\n<br>\nYOU AND PUBLIC STORAGE BOTH AGREE TO GIVE UP THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.\nYOU AND PUBLIC STORAGE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION.\nUnless you and Public Storage agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, consolidated action or private attorney general action.\nIf this specific provision, known as the \u201cClass Action Waiver,\u201d is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void except Section 18.1, which shall remain in full force and effect.</p> 19.\nMiscellaneous\n<p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the use of our Service, superseding any prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written, or electronic) between you and us regarding such subject matter.\nYou agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and us as a result of these Terms or your access to and use of the Service.\nYou are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all Devices and other equipment and software, and all internet service provider, mobile service, and other services needed for your access to and use of the Service and you will be responsible for all charges related to them.\nOur failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.\nSubject to Section 18.5 above, if any provision of these Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from the Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.\nNeither the course of conduct nor course of dealing between the parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any provision of these Terms.\nPublic Storage may assign its rights and duties under these Terms to any party at any time without notice to you.\nYour rights and duties under these Terms are not assignable by you without our written consent.\nThe provisions of these Terms and any Additional Terms (including the terms applicable to User Submissions), which by their nature should survive your suspension or termination will survive, including the rights and licenses you grant to Public Storage in these Terms, as well as the indemnities, releases, disclaimers, and limitations on liability and the provisions regarding jurisdiction, choice of law, no class action, and mandatory arbitration.\nThese Terms do not provide any third party with any remedy, claim, or right of reimbursement.\nExcept where the context otherwise requires, wherever used, the singular shall include the plural, the plural the singular and the word \u201cor\u201d is used in the inclusive sense (and/or).\nThe term \u201cincluding\u201d as used herein shall mean including, without limiting the generality of any description preceding such term (regardless of whether the term \u201cincluding\u201d is followed by words such as \u201cbut not limited to\u201d or \u201cwithout limitation\u201d in some provisions but not others).\nThe headings in these Terms are for the sole purpose of convenience of reference and shall not in any way limit or affect the meaning or interpretation of any of the provisions of these Terms.</p> 20.\nTerms Applicable to our App\n<p>\n<strong>A.\nApps Generally</strong>.\nAs part of the Service you may
