use of cookies, pixel tags, local shared objects, web storage and other similar technologies.\nBy using the Services, you are consenting to the use of the technologies described herein and similar technologies to collect and store information on your device or web browser.</p>\n<p>A cookie is a piece of information placed on your computer or mobile device through your web browser when you access and/or use the Services that stores text and which can later be read back by the Services or third parties.\nCookies are used to recognize your browser and you as a unique user.\nCookies may be session cookies (i.e., last only for one browser session) or persistent cookies (i.e., continue on your browser until they are affirmatively deleted).\nYou can manage cookies through your web browser's option settings, and through those settings you may be able (i) to receive notifications when you are receiving new cookies, (ii) to disable cookies or (iii) to delete cookies.\nPlease refer to your web browser's help section for information on how to do this.</p>\n<p>A pixel tag, or web beacon, is a tiny invisible tag or graphic placed on certain parts of the Services or other websites, in emails or in certain other downloadable content, but not on your computer, mobile device or browser, except to the extent that you download the content that contains such tags.\nPixel tags do not store information on your computer, mobile device or browser (although they are occasionally downloaded to your computer if contained in an email or other downloadable content) so they cannot be managed by you except by deleting the content in which the tag is contained.\n</p>\n<p>A local shared object is similar to a cookie, except it can store more than just text.\nLocal shared objects are stored on your computer or mobile device.\nYou can manage privacy and storage settings for local shared objects by visiting Flash\u2019s Website Storage Settings panel.\nWe may use third-party website analytics services in connection with the Services, including, for example, to register mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity and text typed into our websites.\nWe use the information collected from these services to help make the Services easier to use and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.\nThese website analytics services generally do not collect Personal Data unless you voluntarily provide it and generally do not track your browsing habits across websites that do not use their services.</p>\n<p>To determine if users have interacted with content across multiple devices and to match such devices, we may work with partners who analyze device activity data and/or rely on your information (including demographic, geographic and interest-based data).\nTo supplement this analysis, we may also provide de-identified data to these partners.\nBased on this data, we may then display targeted advertisements across devices that we believe are associated or use this data to further analyze usage of Services across devices.</p>\n<p>We use and allow third parties to use these technologies for a variety of purposes, including, without limitation, the operation of the Services or parts of the Services, monitoring the Services and to analyzing how you use the Services, allowing us to provide certain functionality on the Services and to remember your preferences, delivering advertisements to you, both on and off the Services.\nBy using these technologies, we aim to provide advertisements targeted to your interests.\nSometimes this is called online behavioral, interest-based, or retargeted advertising.\nFor more information on these types of ads, or to stop use of tracking technologies for these purposes, go to www.aboutads.info or www.networkadvertising.org.</p>\n<p>Your choices</p>\n<p>You can use the Services without providing any Personal Data or with limiting the Personal Data you provide.\nIf you choose not to provide any Personal Data or limit the Personal Data you provide, you may not be able to use certain functionality of the Services.\nFor instance, in order to register for an event, your name and email address will be required.\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Opt out</i>: You can \"opt out\" of receiving our marketing emails from us by clicking unsubscribe within the email.\nIt may take several days for us to process an unsubscribe request.\nYou can stop receiving Service communications and tournament organizers\u2019 emails only by contacting us at contact@battlefy.com.\nFurther, tournament organizers who have received your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy may still use that Personal Data to contact you in accordance with their own policies, but they may not use our system to do so.\nYou can also close your Battlefy account.\nOnce your account is closed, you will permanently lose all of your profile information.\n</p>\n<p>Do Not Track</p>\n<p>We currently do not participate in any \"Do Not Track\" frameworks that would allow us to respond to signals or other mechanisms from you regarding the collection of your Personal Data.</p>\n<p>Special Information for California

time to time.\nModifications to this Privacy Policy will be posted to our battlefy.com website.\nIn certain circumstances, we may choose to provide you with additional notice of such modifications by email, in-Service notifications or otherwise.\nPlease review this policy periodically, and especially before you provide any Personal Data.\nYOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SERVICES FOLLOWING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANY MODIFICATIONS TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY CONSTITUTES ACCEPTANCE OF THOSE MODIFICATIONS.\nIF ANY MODIFICATION TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY IS NOT ACCEPTABLE TO YOU, YOUR SOLE REMEDY IS TO

our information systems), impractical or abusive (e.g., repetitive requests, requests made in bad faith or requests that would compromise third party information).\nNote that you may not have access to or the ability to update Non-Personal Data, much of which is held in aggregate form.\nUnder the GDPR, you may be entitled to additional rights, including: (i) the right to withdraw consent to processing where consent is the basis of processing.\n(ii) the right to access your Personal Data and certain other supplementary information, under certain conditions.\n(iii) the right to object to
