the agreement existing between you and O&amp;O.\nWhen making such a transfer, you are required to hand over to the third party all materials related to the software that are covered in the contract and to delete the software from any storage volumes (e.g., hard disks) remaining in your possession.</p>\n<p>(9) Unauthorized rental and service - The purchase of this contract does not entitle you to

purposes of collection.</p>\n<p>(5) Until payment is made in full, O&amp;O retains possession of all rights, particularly those concerning copyrighted rights of use, on the materials included in this contract.\nO&amp;O is specifically entitled to cancel a contract, for example, when your payment is delayed, it prohibits the further using of the software and demands the surrendering of all copies or this being impossible, to demand their deletion.\nShould a third party have access to the object of purchase before payment is completed for the contractual software, you are required to inform this third party about the object being the property of O&amp;O and to inform O&amp;O, in writing, about the third party\u2019s access.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.\nMaterial defect and defect of title</strong>\n<br>\n(1) The software package or download you receive is free of any material defect or defect of title.</p>\n<p>(2) A material defect exists when the software is unable to be used as described in the documentation appearing on the website www.oo-software.com and included in delivery or available for downloading.\nO&amp;O is constantly checking to make sure that other sources are not misrepresenting the functions and properties of the software as described in the documentation.\nYou can therefore assume that any descriptions beyond those found in the software documentation have not originated with O&amp;O and are also unknown to it.\nPlease inform O&amp;O if you learn of any software descriptions that include functions and properties not mentioned in the documentation.</p>\n<p>(3) A defect of title exists when, after delivery of the software, the rights needed for using it as stipulated in the contract have not been effectively granted.</p>\n<p>(4) Any claims concerning defects of material and/or title related to the software have a limitation period of two years subsequent to delivery of the program or transmission of the serial number needed for downloading.\nIf you are not a private individual, the warranty period is shortened to one year.\nIf O&amp;O has fraudulently concealed a material defect, a three year limitation period will cover claims related to this defect.\nPayment for compensation that you might have been entitled to as a result of cancellation or an abatement can be refused upon expiration of the limitation period.</p>\n<p>(5) You are required to inform O&amp;O, in writing if possible, of any defects that arise immediately upon their discovery.\nWhile doing so you should also describe, as well as possible, how the defect is communicated, the effect it has on the program, and under which circumstances it occurs.</p>\n<p>(6) Should defects be reported to O&amp;O within the limitation period, it will undertake a cure free of charge.</p>\n<p>(7) As part of the cure, the corrected software will be redelivered as agreed.\nAn on-site analysis and correction of the error on your system will not take place.\nO&amp;O assumes the ensuing expenses for the cure, in particular the costs for transport, labor, and material.\nYou are personally responsible for installation.\nO&amp;O specifically does not assume on-site installation as part of its obligation with regard to defects of material or title.\nShould a change of the program be required as part of the cure, O&amp;O will make the necessary changes in the documentation without any charges.</p>\n<p>(8) After the unsuccessful expiration of a deadline you set for cure, you can cancel the contract or reduce the purchase price and demand compensation instead of service or the replacement of any futile expenditures.</p>\n<p>(9) A deadline is not required when a) O&amp;O refuses both kinds of cure, even if it is entitled to do so as a result of the arising expenses, or b) the cure is impossible, or c) the cure is unacceptable to you, or d) the cure is unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>A subsequent improvement is considered a failure after the second unsuccessful attempt, unless there is something particular about the type of software or the defect itself or the surrounding circumstances that would indicate otherwise.</p>\n<p>(10) You are not entitled to cancel the contract if the defect is negligible, nor may you, in this event, demand compensation instead of full service.</p>\n<p>(11) In the event of cancellation, compensation is due for any uses made.\nThe compensation for use will be based on a four year, straight-line depreciation of the purchase price.</p>\n<p>(12) As a result of the abatement, the purchase price will be reduced by the amount which is calculated for deducting the defect from the value of the software.\nThe standard used will be its value at the time the contract was concluded.\nThe amount, when necessary, is to be calculated by estimation.\nAs a result of this reduction, any amount larger than that paid for the reduced purchase price will be refunded.</p>\n<p>(13) If it turns out that a reported problem did not arise as a result of a defect in the software, O&amp;O is entitled to invoice you, according to the amount charged in its price lists for such services, the expenses for analysis and correction of the problem if you can be accused of malice or gross negligence.</p>\n<p>(14) The seller\u2019s warranty is canceled, when changes are made on the software without expressed written consent or when the software is not used as intended or used in an improper software environment, unless you can prove that these facts had nothing to do with the problems that occurred.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nLimitation of compensation</strong>\n<br>\n(1) O&amp;O is liable for compensation for every legal ground to the extent described in the following provisions.</p>\n<p>(2) The extent of liability of O&amp;O for damages caused by malice or gross negligence arising from O&amp;O itself or one of its vicarious or legal agents is unlimited.</p>\n<p>(3) There is no limit to the extent of liability of O&amp;O or any of its legal or vicarious agents for damages involving injury to life, physical well-being or health, or for simple breach of duty.</p>\n<p>(4) There is unlimited liability for damages caused by serious organizational fault on the part of O&amp;O as well as for damages arising from a missing guaranteed characteristic.</p>\n<p>(5) For the breach of an essential contractual duty, O&amp;O is liable for damages normally foreseen in a contract when none of the instances in provisions (2) - (4) applies.</p>\n<p>(6) Any further liability for compensation is excluded, specifically excluded is liability without fault.</p>\n<p>(7) Liability as defined by the product liability law remains untouched.</p>\n<p>(8) If damage can be traced to have arisen through a fault on the part of O&amp;O as well as on the part of yourself, you must have your share of the fault evaluated.</p>\n<p>You are responsible for making a standard backup of your data at least once a day.\nFor data loss caused by O&amp;O, O&amp;O is only liable for the expense of duplicating the data on your backup copies that need to be created and for the restoration of data, which would have also been lost during a standard backup procedure.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.\nFinal provisions</strong>\n<br>\n(1) You may only balance claims from O&amp;O with indisputable or legally valid claims.</p>\n<p>(2) Changes and amendments to this contract must be made in writing.\nThis also applies to changes to this provision.</p>\n<p>(3) The contract is subject to German law.\nThe uniform UN purchasing law (CISG) as well as the UNIDROIT Factoring Agreement of Ottawa do not apply.</p>\n<p>(4) Any general terms and conditions on your part will not be applied.</p>\n<p>(5) This license agreement is subject to the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany.\nIn the event you are not a private individual or a resident of the Federal Republic of Germany, we agree that the district court in Berlin will be the competent court for litigation arising from this
