\"unsubscribe\" link in an email that you receive from us.</li>\n<li>Your Provider may be monitoring and/or recording voice calls, video calls, or other communications on the Platform (collectively, \"Call Recording\").\nNotification, consent, and other requirements for Call Recording vary by state and jurisdiction.\nYour Provider is solely responsible for any such Call Recording, and we suggest

RELIABILITY, SEQUENCING, SPEED OF DELIVERY, OR ARISING FROM THE COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, COURSE OF DEALING, OR USAGE OF TRADE.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE PLATFORM IS NOT INTENDED TO SUPPORT OR CARRY EMERGENCY CALLS (E.G., 911) BY VOICE OR SMS TO ANY EMERGENCY SERVICES.\nNEITHER SPRUCE NOR ITS RELATED PERSONS WILL BE LIABLE UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGE, OR LOSS (AND YOU WILL HOLD SPRUCE AND ITS RELATED PERSONS HARMLESS AGAINST ANY AND ALL SUCH CLAIMS) ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THE INABILITY TO USE THE PLATFORM TO CONTACT EMERGENCY SERVICES.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>WITH RESPECT TO OUR VOIP PHONE SERVICES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE DO NOT HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER WHETHER, OR THE MANNER IN WHICH, CALLS USING OUR 911 DIALING SERVICE ARE ANSWERED OR ADDRESSED BY ANY LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE CENTER.\nWE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONDUCT OF SUCH LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE CENTERS AND THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY CALLING CENTER.\nWE RELY ON THIRD PARTIES TO ASSIST US IN ROUTING 911 DIALING CALLS TO LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE CENTERS AND TO A NATIONAL EMERGENCY CALLING CENTER.\nWE DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY IN THE EVENT SUCH THIRD PARTY DATA USED TO ROUTE CALLS IS INCORRECT OR YIELDS AN ERRONEOUS RESULT.\nYOU AGREE THAT WE MAY NOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGE, OR LOSS, AND YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY AND ALL SUCH CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION, ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO OUR 911 DIALING SERVICE, UNLESS SUCH CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION ARISE FROM OUR GROSS NEGLIGENCE, RECKLESSNESS, OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER SPRUCE NOR ITS RELATED PERSONS WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY YOUR RELIANCE ON INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH THE PLATFORM.\nIT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO EVALUATE THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, TIMELINESS, RELIABILITY, OR USEFULNESS OF THE PLATFORM.\nFURTHERMORE, SPRUCE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE PLATFORM WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, OR FREE FROM ERROR, DEFECT, LOSS, DELAY IN OPERATION, CORRUPTION, CYBER ATTACK, VIRUSES, INTERFERENCE, HACKING, MALWARE, OR OTHER SECURITY INTRUSION, OR THAT THE USE OF THE PLATFORM AND/OR INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH THE PLATFORM WILL NOT CAUSE ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR MOBILE PHONE OR COMPUTER OR LOSS OF DATA.</strong>\n</p> XIII.\nLimitation of Liability <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and except as set forth in this Section, Spruce, its Related Persons, and licensors will not be liable to you or to any party under any legal or equitable theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, strict liability, or otherwise, for any indirect, punitive, special, incidental, or consequential loss or damage, including lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, service interruption, mobile phone damage, or system failure, or the cost of substitute products or services, or for any damages for personal or bodily injury or emotional distress, including death, arising out of or in connection with any access or use of (or inability to use) the Platform.\nThis is true even if Spruce or its Related Persons have been advised of the possibility of such damages or losses.\nTo the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and subject to this Section, in no event will the total liability of Spruce and its Related Persons for any damages, claims, or losses arising under these Terms exceed the total amount of payments actually paid by you to us, if any, in the preceding twelve (12) months prior to the date the liability first arose.</p> XIV.\nModifications to the Platform <p>Spruce reserves the right at any time and for any reason to modify, or temporarily or permanently discontinue, the Platform, or any portion thereof, with or without notice.\nYou agree that Spruce will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Platform.\nWithout limiting the foregoing, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you in advance of any discontinuation of the Platform in its entirety.</p> XV.\nSuspension and Termination Rights <p>The Terms will remain in full force and effect as long as you continue to access or use the Platform.\nYou may terminate the Terms by discontinuing use of the Platform.\nYour permission to use the Platform automatically terminates if you violate these Terms.</p>\n<p>Except for termination or suspension by us subject to Section II, we may terminate or suspend any of the rights granted by these Terms and your access to our Platform for any reason upon thirty (30) days written notice to you.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, we may immediately terminate these Terms and your access to our Platform if required by applicable regulatory authorities or if we determine that any change in any applicable federal, state, or local government laws, rules, or regulations would render unlawful the conduct under these Terms of you or us.</p>\n<p>The following Sections survive the expiration or termination of these Terms for any reason whatsoever: VII (Restrictions on Use), XII (Disclaimer), XIII (Limitation of Liability), XVI (Governing Law.\nDispute Resolution.\nArbitration.\nClass Action Waiver), and XVII (Miscellaneous).</p>\n<p>Subject to applicable law, Spruce reserves the right to maintain, delete, or destroy all communications and materials posted or uploaded to the Platform in its sole discretion.</p> XVI.\nGoverning Law.\nDispute Resolution.\nArbitration.\nClass Action Waiver <p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU AND SPRUCE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN US THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM SPRUCE.</p> A.\nGoverning Law <p>The Platform is controlled and operated by us from the United States, and is not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country, or territory other than that of the United States.\nThese Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflicts of law principles.</p> B.\nArbitration Agreement <p>You and Spruce agree that all claims and disputes relating in any way to your use of our Platform, or arising out of or in connection with these Terms, will be resolved by binding arbitration, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, on an individual basis, except for any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents, or any dispute already pending at the time you first agree to these Terms.\nYou also agree that any arbitration will take place in San Francisco, California.</p> C.\nWaiver of Jury Trial <p>IN THE EVENT ARBITRATION IS CONTRARY TO APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND SPRUCE WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL OR STATUTORY RIGHT TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.\nYou and Spruce are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration.\nArbitration is the referral of a claim or dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the claim or dispute and making a final binding determination to resolve it instead of having it decided by a judge or jury in court.\nArbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.\nThe arbitrator's award will be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p> D.\nNo Class Arbitrations, Class Actions, or Representative Actions <p>YOU AND SPRUCE AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS.\nCLAIMS AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE BROUGHT AS A CLASS OR OTHER TYPE OF REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, WHETHER WITHIN OR OUTSIDE OF ARBITRATION, OR ON BEHALF OF ANY INDIVIDUAL OR OTHER GROUP.\nUNLESS BOTH YOU AND SPRUCE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.\nALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S) OR DISPUTE.\nANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER SPRUCE USERS OR CUSTOMERS.</p> E.\nArbitration Rules <p>The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision.\nAny arbitration between you and Spruce will be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") and will be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules.\nThe AAA Rules and filing forms are available at www.adr.org.</p> XVII.\nMiscellaneous <p>The Terms set forth the entire understanding and agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter hereof.\nIf any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms will remain in full force and effect.\nHeadings are for reference only and in no way define, limit, construe, or describe the scope or extent of such section.\nOur failure to act with respect to any failure by you or others to comply with these Terms does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar failures.\nYou may not assign or transfer your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent, and any assignment or transfer in violation of this provision will be null and void.\nExcept as otherwise set forth in these Terms: (a) any notice given by us to you will be provided via email to the email address used to register your account and/or, in our sole discretion, to the email address of the person listed as your Provider's administrator on the Platform, and will be deemed to be both written and fully given on the date of sending.\nand (b) any notice given by you to us will be provided as set forth in Section XIX.</p> XVIII.\nCopyright Infringement Claims
