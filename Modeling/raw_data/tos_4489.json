vibes, we want you to share the things that matter to you most with your friends, family and anyone else around you.\nIt\u2019s important to us that you feel comfortable and trust us with your information when you use the Viber services (the \u201cServices\u201d).\nPlease take a few minutes to read this Privacy Policy, so that you understand what information we collect, what we do with it and why, how we protect it and what are your rights in relation to this information.</p>\n<p>In general, we only collect information that allows us to provide you with our best Services.\nThis includes, for example, simple tasks like allowing other users to see the name and picture you choose to show.\nIt also helps us to keep our Services clear of fraud and spam, and it allows us to get a unique understanding of what additional services may be useful to you, and all other purposes set out in this policy below.</p>\n<p>Starting with Viber 6.0, all of Viber\u2019s core features are secured with end-to-end encryption: Viber calls, one-on-one messages, group messages, private media sharing and linked devices.\nThis means that the encryption keys are stored only on your devices and no one, not even Viber itself, has access to them.\nTo learn more about Viber Encryption, follow this link:&nbsp;<b>http://www.viber.com/en/security</b>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Scope and consent</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Before you start sharing good vibes, it\u2019s important you understand that by using our Services, you allow us to collect, use, disclose, and retain your personal information and other information but we will never read or listen to the content you are sharing privately.\nYou can be sure that we will only use your information as described in this Policy.</p>\n<p>By using the Service, you are also agreeing to our&nbsp;<b>Terms of Use</b>.\nPlease make sure you read and agree with our Terms of Use if you want to use Viber.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information we collect</strong>\n</p>\n<p>First of all, we want you to be assured that we do not read or listen to the content of your messages and/or calls made privately via Viber and we do not store those messages once they have been delivered to their destination (which on average takes less than one second).\nIf for some reason the message wasn\u2019t delivered to its destination within up to 2 weeks, it will be deleted from our servers.</p>\n<p>Note that chats with bots, in communities and in Channels are not end-to-end encrypted, but we do encrypt such messages when sent to the Viber servers and when sent from the Viber servers to the relevant third party (the bot&nbsp.\nowner and/or additional third party tool (e.g.\nCRM solution) integrated by such owner).</p>\n<p>We collect the minimum information required to achieve the purposes set out in this Policy (see below), and you have the ability to limit such collection, as specified below under \u201cYour Choices\u201d:</p>\n<p>(a) Registration and Account Information:&nbsp;When you use our various Services you voluntarily give us personal information (e.g., name, email, birth date, age, phone number and, when necessary, billing information) and you are not anonymous to us.\nThat means your name and photo (if you choose to provide them) will be visible to other Viber users and they can search you by name unless you change your settings.\nWe may suggest you as a possible contact to people we believe you may know (without revealing your phone number), unless you turn off this option.\nWe may notify your contacts when it\u2019s your birthday, unless you turn off this option.\nWhen you install the Viber App, you\u2019ll also be asked to allow us access to your mobile device\u2019s address book.\nA copy of the phone numbers and names of all your contacts (whether they\u2019re Viber members or not \u2013 but only name and phone number) will be collected and&nbsp;stored on our servers, mainly in order for us to be able to enable you and your contacts to connect.</p>\n<p>(b) Social Media Information:&nbsp;If you sign in to your Viber account through third-party social media sites like VK, you agree to give us on-going access to your personal information on such sites (e.g., your public profile, friend list, accounts you follow or who follow you, your email address, birthday, work history, education history, interests, current city, and video viewing).\nWe may receive certain information about you which is stored on social media sites if users of those sites give us access to their profiles and you are one of their friends or connections, depending upon your settings on those sites.</p>\n<p>(c) Activity Information:&nbsp;While using the Viber Services, we will collect, and other users can see, your connection status, whether you have received and seen messages sent to you, if you are currently on another call, and information related to the calls and messages you have sent and received such as length of the call, who called who, who messaged who, and at what time.\nif you do not want people to know that you\u2019re online or that you\u2019ve seen messages, you can change these options in your settings.\nAs for delivered status and call information (length of the call, missed calls etc.), we believe they are important for other Viber users and therefore cannot be canceled.\nFor Secret Chats, we will notify the other members of any screenshots you\u2019ve taken (so please respect the vibe and do not take them).</p>\n<p>When you interact with bots, Communities and/or Channels on our Service, we may obtain information about the messages you have liked, comments you have left and also websites you\u2019ve viewed through links in them or otherwise links you have viewed from within Viber.\nWhen you send links through messages, with your permission, we may collect data about such links you have visited.\nWhen you use our Chat Extensions we may know which items you searched and shared.\nIn addition, we collect information about the accounts you have visited and the content you have viewed in order to improve the relevance of our Services.</p>\n<p>We collect information about the value added services you are using over Viber and/or apps (such as games) you have downloaded through Viber.\nThis includes whether you are presently online, your personal preferences (such as connecting the service to Viber) and the way you use that service (for example how often, for how long).\nWe may also tell other Viber users that you are using a certain service or app (to recommend them to try that service as well).</p>\n<p>(d) Information from Other Sources:&nbsp;The information we collect may be combined with information from outside records (e.g.\ndemographic information and additional contact information) that we have received in accordance with the law.</p>\n<p>(e) Device and Location Information:&nbsp;We collect additional information when you access our App through a certain device (e.g.\nyour mobile device\u2019s unique identifier.\nyour session\u2019s ip address.\ninformation about your device\u2019s operating system, your browser, browser or operating system language.\nyour wireless network, and your mobile carrier.\nthe Viber call log).\nWe may also collect your WPS location data \u2013 you can choose whether to allow this by changing your geolocation tracking settings.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Specific Accounts \u2013 Viber Out Account, Email Linked to Viber&nbsp;Account</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Viber Out Account Registration:</b>&nbsp;Our Viber Out service allows you to call a number outside of the Viber registered community at low cost local rates.\nWhen you use&nbsp;Viber Out, you may create a \u201cViber Account\u201d by selecting a password, and providing certain personal information (e.g., name, email and billing information).\nWe will also keep your Viber Out call detail records for billing and legal records, and to make you relevant offers.\nWhen calling through Viber Out, just like regular phone calls you make, details of the call are available to the phone operator of the person you called (and possibly other facilitating phone operators \u2013 but this is the same as any regular phone call you make).</p>\n<p>\n<b>Linking your email to Viber and Rakuten group:</b>\n<b>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;When you select to connect your email to your Viber account, we will use information you provided in the registration process (e.g., name, email, password, phone number), as well as your IP address to do so.\nWhen we link your email account to the Viber account, we will also automatically create an account for you with our parent company, Rakuten Group Inc., and other entities in the Viber corporate family (Group) if you do not already have an account with one of the services.\nCertain registration and activity data will be shared with the Rakuten corporate family as part of this process, as described below.\nYou can choose to delink your Viber account from the Rakuten account at any time by editing your profile on the app.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Uses and Retention:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our mission is to constantly improve our Services and provide you with new experiences.\nAs part of this mission, we use your information for the following purposes:</p>\n<p>(a)&nbsp;Make our service available: We use your Registration and Account information to (i) register you for the App and create your User Account for Viber.\n(ii) create your profile and make it visible.\n(iii) process your payments.\n(iv) create your Viber ID.\n(v) provide customer service, give you information about your account, and respond to your requests.\n(vi) personalize your experience by providing content (such as games) on the Service, including targeted advertising of Viber services and other 3rd party services that we believe may be of most interest to you.\npersonalization may include automated decisions about what you will view and when, but be assured that it will not have legal effects on you;&nbsp;(vii) indicate which of your contacts is already a Viber member and notify you when your contacts become active on the Service.\n(viii) display the name of the contact as it appears in your address book when a call is received on the Service, and (ix) sync your contacts with Viber running on Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android tablets, iPads and Windows Tablets.\nIf you deactivate your Viber account, it will delete the address book from our servers (more about this below), quickly and permanently.\nOtherwise, we keep your contact information for as long as you use the App so we can provide you all functions of the App.</p>\n<p>(b) Improve our Services:&nbsp;We use call log information and usage information (as described above) to better understand network behavior and trends (numbers of messages and calls made by users, typical destinations, call lengths, network type, etc.), detect potential outages and technical issues (this helps us notice things like a drop in call volume in a certain geography, a shift in call length, a change in typical networks, etc.) to improve our Services.</p>\n<p>(c) Provide Interesting Offerings to You and others: As part of value added services provided by us or by a third party within Viber, we may use your information to continuously optimize and personalize those services and send you personal updates about new offerings which we believe you will find relevant.\nWe may share with our service providers unique identifiers to determine the best way to tell potential new users about our services.\nWhen you join Viber, the contacts in your address book that are already Viber members may be informed that you\u2019re now on Viber too.</p>\n<p>Sending a&nbsp;message to a bot, subscribing to a bot will allow admins of that bot to send you notifications and personal messages.\nIf you do not wish to receive such notifications, you may adjust your account settings to decline them or opt-out at any time from receiving further notifications.&nbsp;You will be asked to allow the use of your location data before Viber provides you specific location services offerings, and you may also adjust your phone preferences to disable the use of your location data at any time.</p>\n<p>(d) Process Your Payments: We may use your Information like your name and phone number to process your payments for our Services through a secured third-party service provider and, on an aggregate basis to determine charges for our phone carriers and other service providers.</p>\n<p>(e)&nbsp;Prevent Fraud &amp.\nSpam.\nenforcement of law: We really want Viber to be free of spam and fraudulent content so that you feel safe and free.\nWe may use your information to prevent, detect, and investigate fraud, security breaches, potentially prohibited or illegal activities, protect our trademarks and enforce our&nbsp;<b>Terms of Use</b>.\nThis may include URLs included in messages, which were reported as SPAM by other users, or were otherwise suspected to be unsolicited and using your operating system authentication services.\nWe may use automated decisions to close an account based on such data and other logic we have created for this, in order to protect other users and prevent recurring breaches.\nIf your account has been blocked you can contact our support.&nbsp;We may use your information and call log information to comply with applicable laws.</p>\n<p>(f) Communicate With You: As part of the Viber family, we want to keep in touch with you.\nWe use your information to contact you (via message or other means) to maintain the App, including your Viber Out User Account, to comply with your stated communication preferences or to provide updates about other Viber services.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Data Retention:</b>&nbsp;Unless otherwise specified, we retain information as long as it is necessary and relevant for us to achieve the purposes referred to above or to enable us to comply with our legal data protection retention obligations.\nUpon deactivation of your account, we will minimize the personal data we keep about you only to such data which we are required to keep to comply with laws, or other legal reasons.\nWe may keep activity data on a non-identifiable basis to improve our services.\nYour posts on public accounts and communities and Channels may remain available if you do not delete them.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Disclosure:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Your data is kept safe with us, but we do share your personal information with third parties we trust in order to provide you with our services, as follows:</p>\n<p>(a)&nbsp;The Viber Corporate Family:&nbsp;We may share the information we collect about you with the Viber corporate family, including our parent company, Rakuten Group Inc., and its and our affiliates and subsidiaries (To learn more about Rakuten Group Inc., which is a publicly traded company in Japan, please follow this link:&nbsp;<b>http://global.rakuten.com/corp/about/</b>).\nThe information may be disclosed to: (i) provide joint content and our services (e.g., registration, coordination of membership accounts between the Viber corporate family, transactions, analytics and customer support).\n(ii) help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts, violations of our policies, fraud and/or data security breaches.\nThe information provided in your registration, if you link your email to the Viber account, will be shared with Rakuten group to create the Rakuten account and/or to link your Rakuten account with your Viber account.\nFor users registering to Viber starting November 20, 2019, details provided during your registration will be shared with Rakuten group to create the Rakuten account and/or to link your Rakuten account with your Viber account.\nData about your use of the Viber Service and Rakuten group services will also be shared to the joint account.\nThe purpose of this practice is to provide joint content and a better service from us and the group, and allow you to enjoy from the Rakuten ecosystem benefits, as well as for fraud prevention and personalization of the services,&nbsp;and any other purpose described in the privacy policy of the other Rakuten group company providing the service.</p>\n<p>(b) App Providers and Other Third-Parties:&nbsp;We may disclose your information to service providers and other third-parties under contract who help with providing you and others our Services on our behalf or other services provided by third-parties via our Services (such as, but not limited to, fraud and spam investigations, payment processing, moderation, site analytics and operations, providing special partnership features in our service\u2013 either on an aggregate non identifiable basis, or using a unique identifier which is not attributable to you).\nThey are required to secure the data they receive and to use the data for pre-agreed purposes only.</p>\n<p>(c) Advertising partners: to enable the limited advertisements on our service, we may share a unique advertising identifier that is not attributable to you, with our third party advertising partners, and advertising service providers, along with certain technical data about you (your language preference, country, city, age, and device data), based on our legitimate interest.\nThis includes partners managing our advertising placements and also advertisers themselves and their agencies or third parties managing their advertising demands.\nYour unique advertising identifier is created by your mobile device\u2019s operating system and you can change it or choose not to share it at any time.\nIf you want to know more, read our <strong>Viber Ads, Cookies &amp.\nTracking Technologies Policy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(d) Legal and Law Enforcement: We may disclose your information to law enforcement, governmental agencies, or authorized third-parties, in response to a verified request relating to terror acts, criminal investigations or alleged illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other Viber user to legal liability.</p>\n<p>(e)&nbsp;Change of Control \u2013 New Owners: We may share your information with another business entity, if we plan to merge with or be acquired by that business, or are involved in a transaction with similar financial effect.\nIn such a situation we would make reasonable efforts to request that the new combined entity or other structure follow this Policy with respect to your personal information.\nIf your personal information was intended to be used differently, we would ask the new entity to provide you with prior notice.</p>\n<p>Because Viber is global, the recipients above may be located outside the country in which you are located.\nSee the section on \u201cInternational Data Transfers\u201d below for more information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information You Share Publicly</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Some of our Services allow you to share information with others on a public basis.\nIf you post information on a public feature of our Services or through social media sites, plug-ins or other applications, do not forget this information is public on our Services and, depending upon your privacy settings, may also become public on the Internet.\nWhen you post on Communities and Channels, the admin of the Community or the Channel has the ability to allow everybody to access it, but you can always actively delete messages you posted.\nWe cannot prevent or control further use of this information so please make sure you only post information that you\u2019re happy to be seen publicly.\nWe may also further use such public information you share, for various reasons, such as improving our service and providing you with relevant content, and analyzing trends.</p>\n<p>You can control what data you share through privacy settings available on some social media sites.\nPlease refer to those third-party sites\u2019 privacy policies and terms of use to learn more about their privacy practices, as we do not control these.</p>\n<p>At this stage, whatever you share publicly is available to the entire Viber community.\nIf you wish to remove a certain piece of content you have shared in the past, you can do that by deleting that content.\nIt will be removed from our services but may remain on local devices of some users (assuming they have chosen to save it).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your Choices</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We want you to have control over how you communicate.\nThat is why, for example, we allow you to delete messages even after they have been sent (it will be deleted for you, your friend and our service).\nHow cool is that? You can also control your privacy settings within the App to change the visibility of your online status or prevent other users from knowing which Viber&nbsp;apps and games you are using.\nYou can disable the \u201cseen\u201d notification so that other users do not know whether you\u2019ve read a message yet.\nYou can choose not to share your photo and/or birthday, not to allow other users to look you up by name, request your data and request to delete your data along with many other additional options, which are available within the app.\nYou can also make additional choices on your phone\u2019s settings by changing our app\u2019s permissions such as location sharing, access to contact list and more.</p>\n<p>Every now and then, Viber may send you updates about administration and operation of the Service (for example, about your transactions, policy changes, technical issues, etc.).\nWe may also send notifications about offerings by Viber or third-parties, that we think may be of interest to you.\nIf you do not wish to receive such notifications, you may adjust your system settings to decline them.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Viber Ads, Cookies &amp.\nTracking Technologies

troubleshoot programs, enforce our Terms of Use, or take other actions permitted by law.\nLikewise, if your account or membership is terminated or suspended, we may maintain some information to prevent you from re-registering.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Specific Location Practices: California, EEA residents</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>California Privacy Rights</b>\n</p>\n<p>Residents of the State of

for&nbsp;connecting&nbsp;and sharing, make sure to be sending good vibes and make your friends smile.\nEventually, this is what Viber is for.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third-Party websites and

new face lense feature that uses camera capabilities in order to add graphic elements on the user\u2019s face.\nSome lenses can make use of TrueDepth API.\nTrueDepth API is only active when those lenses are running.\nIt is a very specific feature and <strong>none of the Viber lenses will be using it at the moment</strong>.\nTypes of lenses that might use it are virtual try-on which we don\u2019t have.\n<strong>Viber does not collect any data from these sensors or ever store it anywhere.\nThe data never leaves the user\u2019s device (so cannot be and is not shared by Viber with

duration, the call will be disconnected and require a re-dial.\nWhile we always try to keep our rates as low as possible, Viber may change the rates for calling phones at any time without notice to

devices, please follow these instructions for your mobile device:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>Android/iOS Device: On Android open the Google Settings app on your device and select \u201cads\u201d to control the settings.\nOn iOS devices with iOS 6 and above use Apple\u2019s advertising identifier.\nTo learn more about limiting ad tracking using this identifier, visit the settings menu on your device or the following links:\n<ul>\n<li>iOS \u2013 <strong>https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Android \u2013

14.5, Apple introduced the AppTracking Transparency (ATT) framework, which requires any app to ask its users for their permission to access their device\u2019s advertising identifier and use the data about them received from the apps and websites owned by other companies, for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes.\nViber will allow you to make your own choice by reacting to the ATT Prompt, which will be displayed prior to connecting identifiable data collected on Viber with identifiable data from other companies\u2019 apps and websites, for advertising purposes.\nFurthermore, you will always have an option to opt out of such tracking by visiting your iOS device\u2019s settings menu.\nOnce the setting is changed, we will work on making this change to take effect in our systems as soon as possible.\nMore information on the AppTracking Transparency (ATT) framework is available <strong>HERE.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Analytics: You can also disable analytics for mobile apps from the settings screen on your mobile device.</li>\n<li>Specific Region Control: If you are a user in the EEA, or the UK, you can also turn off the \u201callow interest-based ads\u201d setting on your Viber privacy settings (for more information see our <strong>EU Region Privacy Notice</strong>).\nIf you are a California user, you can switch the \u201cDo not sell or share my personal information\u201d on (for more info see <strong>CCPA Notice</strong>) \u2013 in which case we will not share your Unique Identifier with our third-party advertisers.</li>\n<li>Location: To opt-out of exact location tracking when using our App, you can use the settings of your device, or the Viber privacy settings.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Opt-Out Provided by Third Parties:&nbsp;</b>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The table above, detailing out third party partners, further includes reference to

referred to as local storage object or LSO) is a data&nbsp;file placed on a device.&nbsp.\nCookies can be created through a variety of web-related protocols and technologies, such as HTTP (sometimes referred to&nbsp;as \u201cbrowser cookies\u201d), and HTML5.\n<strong>Embedded Script&nbsp;</strong>\nAn embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on.\nThe code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.\n<strong>Unique Identifier&nbsp;</strong>\nA unique identifier is a serial number, or string of characters, specific to a&nbsp;user\u2019s mobile device.&nbsp.\nIt is stored on the mobile device and can be retrieved&nbsp;by any app that is downloaded and installed.\nApps typically retrieve this identifier for identification when communicating with servers.This identifier is a tool that allows us and our advertising and marketing partners and service providers to identify your device for tracking user advertising activities and preferences (to know when and which kind of ad has been viewed or clicked, led the user to install an app, make our own marketing and advertising campaigns more relevant and meaningful to user, and to track the efficiency and analyze these campaigns).\nThis identifier is currently the main persistent means of tracking advertising and marketing activity on and across devices.\n<p>Back to top<br>\n</p>\n<b>Contact Us&nbsp;</b>\n<p>For any queries in relation to this Ads &amp.\nCookies Policy please contact us at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Our online form available
