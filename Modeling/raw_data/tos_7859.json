the laws of the State of Tennessee without application of conflict of laws rules.\nVenue for all Claims (defined below) not subject to arbitration shall be in state or federal courts located in Shelby County, Tennessee.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Resolution of any Dispute.</strong>&nbsp;In the event a dispute arises between you and us, we want to provide you with an efficient, neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute.\nMost concerns can be resolved quickly by contacting us, which may be initiated by clicking on the \u201cContact Us\u201d link in the side menu.\nIf, however, there is an issue that needs to be resolved, the following terms describe how both of us will proceed:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Limitation of Legal Remedies.</strong>&nbsp;INSTEAD OF SUING IN COURT, YOU AND WE EACH AGREE TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES ON A BILATERAL (INDIVIDUAL) BASIS.\nYou and we agree that any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of your use of this website or its content (\u201cClaims\u201d) which cannot be settled by mutual agreement of the parties shall be resolved by one arbitrator through binding arbitration.\nThis agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.\nIt includes Claims based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision and award is final and binding, with some exceptions under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n1, et seq., and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Class Action Waiver.</strong>&nbsp;You and we each agree that each of us is waiving the right to a trial by jury and may bring claims against the other only in an individual capacity and not in a class action or representative proceeding.\nAll arbitrations shall be conducted on an individual (and not a class-wide) basis and an arbitrator shall have no authority to award class-wide relief.\nYou acknowledge and agree that these terms specifically prohibit you from commencing any legal proceedings as a representative of others or joining in any arbitration proceedings brought by any other person.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Procedures.</strong>&nbsp;A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the Claim and setting forth the specific relief sought.\nAll notices to us shall be sent to the following address: OneGuard Home Warranty, 150 Peabody Pl.\nSuite 300, Memphis, TN, 38103, ATTN: Legal Department \u2013 Administrator, Alternative Dispute Resolution.\nAll notices to you will be sent to the email or physical address you have provided.\nUpon receipt of such notice, the other party shall have a sixty (60) day period in which it may satisfy the Claim against it by fully curing the Claim and/or providing all the relief requested in the notice, and/or entering into a settlement to resolve the Claim to the mutual satisfaction of the parties.\nAfter the expiration of such sixty-day cure period, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nThe arbitration of any claim or dispute under this Agreement shall be referred to the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA\u2019s Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.\nThese rules and procedures are available by calling the AAA or by visiting its website at&nbsp;www.adr.org.\nThe arbitration of any Claim shall be conducted in the State of Tennessee, and for any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $10,000, Company will: (1) pay all costs of the arbitration.\n(2) if you prefer, conduct the arbitration by telephone, and (3) will not seek attorney\u2019s fees in the event Company prevails.\nEach party shall pay the fees and costs of its own counsel, experts and witnesses.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choice of Law.</strong>&nbsp;This Agreement concerns a transaction in interstate commerce, and therefore shall be governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act (the \u201cFAA\u201d), 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1 et seq.\nThe FAA\u2019s provisions, not state law, govern all questions of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Exception.</strong>&nbsp;Any claim or action for indemnification, contribution, interpleader or injunctive relief arising out of a Claim shall not be subject to arbitration.</p>\nAdditional Terms\n<p>Our failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms of Service shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right.\nNeither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any provision of these Terms of Service.\nWe may assign our rights and duties under these Terms of Service to any party at any time without notice to you.\nIf any of these terms shall be deemed invalid, void or, for any reason, unenforceable, that term shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining term.\nAny rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.</p>\nEntire Agreement\n<p>These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding this website.\nThese Terms of Service supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral, or written, between you and us regarding this website.\nNo modification of these Terms of Service will be effective unless we authorize it.</p>\nAddress of

personal information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies such as cookies, pixel tags and web beacons, browser analysis tools, and web server logs to track and record certain information.\nAs you use our OneGuard Applications, your browser and devices communicate with servers operated by us, our business partners and our service providers to coordinate and record your activity and fulfill your requests (\u201c<u>Usage Information</u>\u201d).\nWe collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies.\nFor example, we may collect information from the devices you use to access our OneGuard Applications, your operating system type or mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device.\nBrowsers routinely send these types of information to web servers.\nIn addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier (\u201c<u>Device Identifier</u>\u201d) from your computer (or other device) used to access the OneGuard Applications (each, a \u201c<u>Device</u>\u201d).\nA Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to the Device used to access the OneGuard Applications, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.\nWe may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to our OneGuard Applications and the website you visit after you leave our OneGuard Applications, if this information is supplied to us by your browser.\nWe may use this Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the OneGuard Applications.</p>\n<p>The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server logs and also in web cookies kept on your Device(s), which are then transmitted back to our Site by your Device(s).\nThese servers are operated, and the cookies managed, by us, our business partners or our service providers.\nFor example, when you visit OneGuard Applications, we and our service providers may place cookies on your Device(s).\nCookies allow us to recognize you when you return to an OneGuard Application and may track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience.\n&nbsp;Cookies also help us detect certain kinds of fraud.\nA \u201ccookie\u201d is a small amount of information that a web server sends to your browser that stores information about your account, your preferences, and your use of the OneGuard Applications.\nSome cookies contain serial numbers that allow us to connect your activity with OneGuard Applications with other information we store about you in your profile or as related to your interactions with OneGuard Applications.</p>\n<p>Some cookies are temporary, whereas others may be configured to last longer.\n&nbsp;\u201cSession\u201d cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as to manage page views.\nYour browser usually erases Session cookies once you exit your browser.\n\u201cPersistent\u201d cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored on your computers or mobile devices even beyond when you exit your browser.\nWe use Persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided.\n\u201cFlash\u201d cookies, known as local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit.\nOur third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information.\nFlash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and way data is stored.\nCookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages.\nYou can choose to have your computer warn you each time a Persistent or Session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings.\nEach browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.\nHowever, cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.\nTo learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please click www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html.\nIn some cases, you may be able to disable cookies on your Device.\nHowever, if you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the OneGuard Applications may not function properly.\nFor instance, if cookies are disabled, you will not be able to log into the Site and therefore you will experience an anonymous user experience.</p>\n<p>Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on the OneGuard Applications or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed specific actions.\nWhen you access the OneGuard Applications or open email messages, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers.\nThese tools allow us to measure responses to our communications and improve the OneGuard Applications and promotions.</p>\n<p>We also use embedded scripts which are programming codes designed to collect information about your interactions with the OneGuard Applications, such as the links you click on.\nThe code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the OneGuard Applications and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>\n<p>We use HTML5, another form of collection, in our apps for the iPhone or iPad (and any other Apple iOS device).\nHTML5 is another form of collection, tracking and storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies.\nLike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies can be used to track users across website but are not stored in browsers\u2019 cookie files.\nTo our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.</p>\n<p>In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is used in non-identifiable ways, without any reference to personal information.\nFor example, we use information we collect about OneGuard Application users to optimize our Products and Services and understand traffic and usage patterns.\nIn other cases, we associate the information we collect using cookies and related technologies with personal information.\nWhenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your personal information, we will treat it as personal information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Information You Provide About a Third Party</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you send someone else a communication from the OneGuard Applications, such as sending an invitation to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, <em>etc.</em>) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise.\nPlease be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on the OneGuard Applications, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Information We Collect from Third Parties</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information you have provided or that we collected automatically, such as information to validate or update your address or other demographic and lifestyle information.\nWe use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to target our communications so that OneGuard can inform you of products, services and offers that may be of interest to you and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Third Party Analytic Technologies</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use third parties\u2019 analytic and tracking tools to better understand who is using the OneGuard Applications, how people are using the OneGuard Applications, how to improve the effectiveness of the OneGuard Applications and their content and how to serve more targeted advertising to you.\nThose third-party companies may use cookies, pixel tags or other technologies to collect and store anonymous information such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the OneGuard Applications, Device Identifiers, type of operating system used and other website(s) you may have visited.\nThey might combine information they collect from your interaction with OneGuard Applications with information they collect from other sources and use this combined information to send you certain marketing or other communications.\nWe do not have access to, nor control over, third parties\u2019 use of cookies or other tracking technologies.</p>\n<p>If you wish to exercise choice with respect to collection and
