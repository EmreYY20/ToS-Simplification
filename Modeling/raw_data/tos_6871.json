questions or wish to exercise any of your rights in relation to the data we process you can continue to get in touch with us using the contact information set out in this Privacy Policy.\nAnd for information on Virgin Media products and services and how Virgin Media use your information please visit https://www.virginmedia.com/shop/the-legal-stuff/privacy-policy.\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Why do we collect your personal information?&nbsp.\n<p>We collect information because:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You\u2019ve contracted with us.</strong> For example, we need your information to help manage your account and deliver products and services relevant to you (whether we provide them or not), or you work for O2 and we need your information to look after you and your employment with us;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You\u2019ve given us your consent</strong>.\nFor example, if you\u2019ve entered a competition, or agreed for us, or specified third parties, to send you direct marketing, offers and perks that are relevant to you;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We\u2019ve got a legitimate interest</strong> to help us run and grow our business.\nFor example, improving our products and services, developing new ones, telling you or prospective customers about our products and services (unless it\u2019s in a way that requires consent), finding new customers, understanding more about who our customers are and what they like, tailoring our advertising to the right audience/s managing credit and fraud risks, managing our network and complying with our legal and regulatory obligations.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The law also requires us to process some information</strong>.\nFor example, we need to monitor usage to make sure we implement spend caps correctly.\nOccasionally this information is anonymised so you can't be identified.</p>\n<p>To find out more, click on any of the sections below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The type of Information we have.</li>\n<li>Where do we get your information?</li>\n<li>How we use your information.</li>\n<li>How we share your information.</li>\n<li>Why we keep hold of your information.</li>\n<li>How to check and update your information.</li>\n<li>Product specific terms.</li>\n<li>Other important things to know.</li>\n</ul> The type of information we have <p>The information we have about you includes things like who you are, how you use your O2 products and services, where you use our network, and how you pay for your services.</p>\n<p>Who you are&nbsp;includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your name, phone number,&nbsp;address, gender, age, interests, etc.</li>\n<li>Your debit or credit card details, bank details and other payment information.</li>\n<li>Your interests and preferences.</li>\n<li>Your driving license or other documents that help us verify your identity or contact details or your authority to represent an O2 customer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How you use your O2 products and services includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your call, text, surfing and billing records.</li>\n<li>Details about your usage of any other products we supply to you, such as our apps.\nThis includes the date and time you use them, how long for, where you use them and how much it costs.</li>\n<li>We don't look at the content of your messages or listen to your calls (unless you are talking to one of our customer service advisors).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where you use our network:</p>\n<p>So we can connect you to our network, and for some of the purposes mentioned in this Privacy Policy, we need to know your location when you make or receive phone calls, messages or use the internet.\nWe call this network location.\nIt works by finding you through nearby phone masts, providing us with a rough location so we can put calls through or connect you to the internet.</p>\n<p>If you don't want us to share your network location or some or all of your services, call us on 1300.\nIt's free from your O2 mobile.</p>\n<p>Your smartphone might also have a Global Positioning System (GPS) location, that's used by your phone and certain apps.\nIt's more accurate than network location alone, because it uses satellites.\nIf you're using some of our apps, like Priority&nbsp;we, or our partners, might collect some of your GPS location information.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>GPS location is different from network location.\nWe don't control it, so there's no need to call 1300.\nGPS is based on satellites and is set up on the phone itself.\nLook at your phone's settings to configure it.\nRemember, if you choose not to share your location, you might not be able to use certain services that need to know where you are for those services to work.</p>\n<p>What you do with your O2 account(s):</p>\n<p>This includes things such as when and how much you top up and pay your bill, or how often and why you access your account with us.</p> Where do we get your information? <p>We collect information mainly when you sign up with us, contact us and when you use our products and services.\nWe also record calls for training and monitoring purposes.</p>\n<p>For example, we will collect information&nbsp;when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You

medical or criminal record information, about you or a third party.</li>\n<li>You apply for a job with us.</li>\n<li>Your details were included in an application for and performance of an O2 insurance

third parties whose personal or sensitive information you provide to us in your application for and / or performance of O2 products and services, (like O2\u2019s insurance products), for us to receive

above.\n&nbsp;We only provide the information needed for these third parties to perform their services, and they\u2019re only allowed to use it for the purpose that we\u2019ve agreed with them and under the contracts we have put in place with them.</p>\n<p>This might mean sharing that&nbsp;information with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our partner companies or agencies and their sub-contractors or
