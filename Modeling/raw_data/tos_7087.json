eBook provided by the Platform benefits from the legal guarantee of conformity provided by Articles L.217-4 and following of the French Consumer Code, and the guarantee for hidden defects provided by

existing at the time of delivery.\nThe User is informed that, by virtue of the law, in order to comply with the Order, a product must: \u2022&nbsp;Be fit for the use normally expected of a similar good and, where applicable: - correspond to the description given by the seller and possess the qualities that the seller has presented to the buyer in the form of a sample or model.\n- have the qualities that a buyer can legitimately expect in view of the public statements made by the seller, particularly in advertising or labelling.\n\u2022&nbsp;Or present the characteristics defined by mutual agreement between the parties or be suitable for any special purpose sought by the buyer, brought to the knowledge of the seller and accepted by the latter.\nDefects of conformity that appear within twenty-four months of delivery of the eBook are presumed to exist at the time of delivery, unless proven otherwise.\nThe User who wishes to implement this guarantee of conformity must address a complaint to GLOSE under the conditions of article 11.1 in order to obtain the replacement of the eBook or possibly the cancellation of the sale.\nIn this case, it shall be incumbent upon the User to demonstrate non-compliance.\n5.7.2 Guarantee for hidden defects The User may decide to implement the guarantee against hidden defects of the eBook sold, within the meaning of Article 1641 of the

Content deletion 6.1.\nPersonal account deletion 6.1.1 Cases of Personal account deletion The User may delete his User account at any time at the User\u2019s discretion in the \"Account Settings\" section.\nGLOSE may also delete the User's account in the event that the User has not complied with the Terms of Use.\nUnless the User\u2019s breach is of such gravity that it justifies the immediate deletion of the User's account, GLOSE will notify to the User the upcoming deletion of the User\u2019s account with a seven-day prior notice allowing the User to submit his comments.\n6.1.2 Consequences of Personal account deletion The deletion of the User's account will prevent the User from accessing all of the Services and will result in the deletion of the User's name from all Contributions and Content generated by the User on the Platform.\nGLOSE undertakes to destroy all personal data relating to the User whose account has been deleted within seven (7) days.\n6.2.\nContent deletion GLOSE will remove, without any delay, prior notice or formality, any Content published on the Application and the Website that violates these Terms of Use or contravenes

to the standard \"Glose\" Platform (for example, in the case of a User who graduates and is no longer registered in a school).\nIn this respect, a transfer may be preferable to deletion of the User's account so that the User can retain his or her rights to his or her eBooks, his or her content and his or her data.\nGLOSE will make its best efforts to allow transfers of accounts of Users concerned by such circumstances at the request of the User or the User\u2019s school.\n8.\nIntellectual Property 8.1.\nIntellectual property related to the eBooks The works made available to Users by GLOSE on

Use.\nThe fact of knowingly infringing a technical protection measure is punishable by a fine of 3750 euros under Article L.\n335-4-1 of the French Intellectual Property Code, and the fact of knowingly providing means to infringe a technical protection measure is punishable by a prison term of six months and a fine of 30,000 euros.\n8.2.\nIntellectual property related to the Website, the
