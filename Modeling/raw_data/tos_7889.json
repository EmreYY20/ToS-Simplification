signed-in to your customer account or don\u2019t have a customer account, you will need to opt-out on each browser and device you use.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your browser may save some information in its cookies and cache to maintain your privacy preferences.\nClearing these may remove opt-out preferences, requiring you to opt-out again.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you opt-out, you may still see ads online, but these ads will not be based on your inferred interests.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some automated means may still be used to collect information about your interactions with our online services for the other purposes described in this Privacy Policy (like to remember user preferences or enable specific functionality).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may also choose to control targeted ads you receive within apps by using the settings and choices made available to you by your device manufacturer.\nYour device manufacturer will typically have their own privacy settings to block technologies used for targeted advertising or ask for your permission first.</p>\n<p>You can read more about targeted adverting and take additional steps to control targeted advertising from many ad networks and exchanges by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance (www.optout.aboutads.info) or European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (www.edaa.eu).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As online environments continue to evolve, additional opt-out mechanisms or privacy settings may become available to you.\nWe encourage you to review the information on opt-outs and settings that browser owners, device manufacturers, technology companies, and industry associations make available to you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Reasons a request may be denied and exceptions</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may deny your request if we are unable to verify your identity.\nWe use your confirmation of your email address as one way to verify your identity.\nFor example, we may deny your request, if you don\u2019t timely respond to our request to confirm your email address or provide other requested information necessary for us to verify your identity or process your request.\nWe may deny a request from an authorized agent if the agent does not provide required&nbsp;permissions.</p>\n<p>If you make a request to delete your personal information, we may not be able to delete certain information&nbsp;if the information is required for us to process your purchase payments or fulfill your orders (exchanges or returns) or requested services.</p>\n<p>If you participate in a NFT program (like Gap Threads), smart contracts are employed that collect certain information that is then stored on a blockchain that we do not control.\nYour information will be cryptographically transmitted and stored on that blockchain, and any deletion or modification of that information (to the extent possible on a blockchain) is governed by the terms of the relevant smart contract associated with the NFT and may not be able to be modified or deleted due to the immutable nature of the blockchain.</p>\n<p>We may not be able to honor your request, to the extent it otherwise restricts our ability to comply with applicable law (including cooperating with law enforcement) or our regulatory obligations (like maintaining records of your requests and preferences) or in our good-faith judgment we believe information is necessary to exercise or defend a legal claim or protect our operations and property or the privacy, safety, and property of others.</p>\n<p>If we deny your request, you may appeal our decision by writing to us using the address in your area listed under the \"Contact us\" section of this Privacy Policy.\nIf you have concerns about the results of an appeal, you may contact the supervisory authority where you reside.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Non-discrimination</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We do not discriminate against anyone for exercising their privacy rights or making similar requests.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Automated individual decision making</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We do not make decisions about you based solely on automated processing of your personal information, including profiling, which produces legal effects or similarly significantly affects you, unless necessary for entering or performance of a contract with you based on your explicit consent or as authorized by applicable law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Email marketing</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may opt-out of receiving marketing or promotional emails from us by clicking on the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d link contained in such emails.\nPlease keep in mind that if you opt out of receiving marketing or promotional emails, we may still send you transactional communications, such as those relating to your purchases or Loyalty Rewards Program.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Text message marketing</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may opt out of receiving marketing or promotional&nbsp;texts from us by texting the word STOP in response to a text message or following other instructions provided to you when you elected to receive texts.&nbsp;You may have requested texts from more than one list, so you will need to opt-out&nbsp;from each list you are on.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Direct mail</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may request that we stop sending you postal mail offers through the United States post office by writing to us at: Privacy Requests, Legal Department \u2013 Gap Inc., 2 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94105, United States.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Co-branded, co-sponsored, or cross-promotional offerings</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you choose to participate in a co-branded, co-sponsored, or cross-promotional offering, the brand, sponsor, or other third party involved in that offering may use your information for their&nbsp;own purposes, including advertising and marketing.&nbsp;You must contact the relevant third party directly to exercise your opt-out choices with respect to the third party\u2019s use of your information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Push notifications</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If an online service enables push notifications on your device, you may review and update your push notification preferences by adjusting the notification settings provided by your device manufacturer.\nDeactivation may not apply to our in-app notifications and alerts.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>In-store

have operations and vendors in the United States, Canada, and other countries which means we may transfer your personal information to&nbsp;or store or access it in&nbsp;jurisdictions that may not

such as by obtaining your consent, setting up contractual obligations with our service providers and third parties, relying on the European Commission\u2019s adequacy decisions, or executing Standard Contractual Clauses.&nbsp;As applicable law may provide, you may request a copy of these Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting our representative in the United Kingdom and European Union

click to collapse : click to expand <p>When you provide information to us on sites, apps, and other platforms operated by third parties (like using one of our apps on a third-party platform through

content distribution channels operated by third parties (like video sharing and social network websites and apps).\nThe information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy, and the information these third-party operators collect is subject to their own privacy policies.\nPrivacy choices you make on third-party sites, apps, platforms, or content distribution channels will not apply to our use of the information we have collected directly through our online services.</p>\n<p>Please also keep in mind that our online services may contain links to other sites and platforms that we do not own&nbsp;or control.&nbsp;We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other&nbsp;sites and platforms.&nbsp;We encourage you to be aware when you leave our online services and to read the privacy policies published by relevant third parties that may apply.</p> Close Additional information for California residents Additional information for California residents : click to collapse : click to expand <p>This Privacy Policy covers our information practices for the last 12 months regarding the categories of personal information we have collected (under the \"Types of personal information we collect and sources\" section of this Privacy Policy), sold/shared to third parties (under the \"Your privacy rights and choices\" section of this Privacy Policy), and disclosed for business purposes to third parties (under the \"Disclosure of personal information and recipients\" section of this Privacy Policy).\nFor information about your privacy rights and choices and how to exercise them, please review the&nbsp;\"Your privacy rights and choices\" section of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p> Loyalty Rewards Programs <p>\n<strong>Notice of Financial Incentive.&nbsp;</strong>We provide rewards benefits and special offers to customers who participate in our Gap Inc.\nLoyalty Rewards Programs (like Old Navy Navyist Rewards, Banana Republic Rewards, Athleta Rewards, Gap Good Rewards) (collectively, the \"Loyalty Rewards Programs\").&nbsp;We may also provide other program offerings (such as sweepstakes, contests, or promotional campaigns) to customers who sign up to participate or to receive communications from us via email, text, and social media.&nbsp;Personal information is collected when you participate in Loyalty Rewards Programs and other program offerings and may include your contact and transaction information, information we generate and automatically collect, and other information that allows us to tailor our communications and provide offers and products and services we think may be of interest to you.</p>\n<p>You can sign up to participate in Loyalty Rewards Programs online or in stores.&nbsp.\nPlease review our Loyalty Rewards Program Terms and Conditions presented to you when you sign up.&nbsp;You can withdraw from Loyalty Rewards Programs at any time by contacting a customer service representative at 1-833-244-5556.</p>\n<p>You may choose to opt-out of or end communications related to other program offerings, as explained&nbsp;under the \u201cYour privacy rights and choices\u201d section of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Loyalty Rewards Program benefits and offers and other program offerings are reasonably related to the value of a participant\u2019s data based on our estimate of the value of participant\u2019s data that forms the basis for offering the programs (less expenses to provide such programs).\nMethods used to calculate the value of a participant\u2019s data include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Loyalty Rewards&nbsp;</strong>\n<b>Programs.&nbsp;</b>Participants earn points when they purchase products from participating brands that can be used to discount the price of their future purchases with participating brands.\nWe estimated the value of a participant\u2019s data by comparing the amount spent by participants to similarly situated customers who do not participate in the Loyalty Rewards Programs over a 12-month period.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Other special offers.</strong> Participants receive special offers when they sign up, and the value of a participant's data varies based on: (i) the special offer provided at the time, (ii) the amount a participant purchases using that special offer, and (iii) the value of future special offers a participant receives from us and uses to make purchases.\nFor example, a 20% discount offer will be valued differently depending on the amount of a participant's purchases.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you participate in any of our Loyalty Rewards Programs or other program offerings, you will not be treated differently because you exercise a legal right or make a similar request.</p>\n<p>If you request deletion of your personal information, deletion includes your online accounts&nbsp;and Loyalty Program Memberships (unless an exception applies) and all related&nbsp;rewards, benefits, and available promotions.\nWe are not able to reinstate these after deletion</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Statistics on California consumer privacy requests we receive.</strong>
