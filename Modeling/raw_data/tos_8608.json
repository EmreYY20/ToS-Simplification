have designated will be debited (either via one of the debit card networks by using your debit card or via the Automated Clearing House electronic payment system).\nYou may schedule either one-time or recurring monthly payments for monthly parking plans, in addition to one-time payments for on-demand parking services.\nPursuant to the Authorization, your credit card will be charged or your bank account will be debited to make payment to SP+.\nEach time you use the Online Payment Service you agree that SP+ is authorized to process your payment and facilitate the charging of your credit card

Service, you continue to be responsible under your Parking Contract to pay all amounts due on or before the date they are due, and SP+ may terminate your account and/or seek all remedies available to it under the Parking Contract or applicable law if you fail to pay such amounts when due for any reason.\nIt is your sole responsibility to pay your account on time to avoid late fees, collection activities, or suspension of parking privileges.\nIf, in good faith, you dispute any fees, collection activities or suspension of parking privileges, you must provide us written notice of the dispute
