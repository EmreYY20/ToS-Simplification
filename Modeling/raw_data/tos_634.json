<p>We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us (\u201cService Providers\u201d).\nThe suppliers with which Bumble shares User personal data vary depending on a variety of factors, such as which of our App, Sites and services a User engages with.\nFor example, to provide our services to Users, we typically use the following suppliers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Billing services \u2013 to allow customers to purchase paid features of our App (for example, Google Play)</li>\n<li>Authentication services \u2013 to allow customers to authenticate their account (for example, Twilio)</li>\n<li>Social media providers \u2013 to allow customers to create/connect their Bumble account with their account(s) on such platforms (for example Facebook, Instagram or Spotify)</li>\n<li>Product improvement and market research \u2013 we use third party platforms (such as Typeform) and agencies (such as Kantar) to carry out customer surveys and market research to improve our products and services</li>\n<li>IT services \u2013 some of the third-party software providers used in the operation of our business may process Users\u2019 personal data (for example, if a User contacts us via social media with a support inquiry, their inquiry is processed by our community management software provider Khoros)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We carry out due diligence on all Service Providers we engage to ensure they have adequate data protection and information security measures in place and only provide them with the personal data necessary to the service they are providing.\nMeasures are taken to ensure that the data shared is non-attributable to the greatest extent possible and our suppliers are also subject to extensive obligations under our contractual arrangements, including strict data retention limits.</p>\nMarketing Services Providers <p>We partner with providers of marketing services (such as Facebook for example) (\u2018Marketing Services Providers\u2019) to help us market and advertise our App and services on third party websites and applications and measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.\nFor example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to exclude you from advertising campaigns aimed at finding new users, if you already have a Bumble account;</li>\n<li>to show Bumble adverts to users who have visited the Bumble App/Sites but haven\u2019t yet created a Bumble account;</li>\n<li>to create an audience for our advertisements of other potential users who have similar characteristics to you based on the information the Marketing Service Providers holds about you (also known as a Lookalike Audience).\nor</li>\n<li>to include you in a \u2018custom audience\u2019 that will receive Bumble advertising content (a custom audience is essentially a list of people who we think are most likely to be interested in a particular advertisement).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We share a limited amount of your personal data with these Marketing Services Providers, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the advertising identifier associated with your device (this is a random number assigned by your mobile device manufacturer (for example Apple or Google) to your device to help advertisers (including the manufacturer) know when an ad has been viewed or clicked in an app, and when an ad causes a \u2018conversion\u2019 (for example, downloading the app advertised to you))</li>\n<li>your estimated location (based on your IP address)</li>\n<li>age and gender</li>\n<li>data about your visit to our Sites or App and action taken on those (for example if you downloaded our App or created an account with our App)</li>\n<li>a hashed* version of your email address (to create \u2018custom audiences\u2019).</li>\n<br>\n<p>*Hashing is a way of encrypting information by turning it into a combination of random numbers and letters - this code cannot be traced back to the email address.\nWhen hashed email addresses are sent to a Marketing Service Provider, they\u2019re then matched against the Provider\u2019s own existing list of their own users\u2019 hashed information and our ads are served to those of our users who have successfully been matched with the Provider\u2019s.\nMatched and unmatched hashes are then deleted by the Provider.</p>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information about how we use cookies and other tracking technologies, including how you can set and manage your preferences with regards to such technologies, please see our Cookie Policy.</p>\n<p>In some cases, these third parties will also use the data that they collect for their own purposes, for example they may aggregate your data with other data they hold and use this to inform advertising related services provided to other clients.</p>\nFacebook <p>Where we share data with Facebook as our Marketing Service Provider (including via the Facebook \u201cLike\u201d function), we are Joint Data Controllers with Facebook Ireland for this processing.\nThis arrangement means that Bumble has to provide you this notice, but you should contact Facebook if you wish to exercise your data protection rights.\nFurther information, including how Facebook enables you to exercise your data protection rights, and subsequently processes your information as independent data controller can be found in Facebook Ireland\u2019s Data Policy.\nIf you want more information relating to the nature of the arrangement we have in place with Facebook, please email DPO@team.bumble.com.</p>\n<p>This

Facebook pixel.\nThis allows us to measure the effectiveness of our advertising, improve our marketing practices, and helps us deliver more relevant advertising to you and people like you (including on social media such as Facebook).</p>\n4.\nWHAT OTHERS MAY SEE ABOUT YOU.\n<p>We think our Users are awesome, and we want you to share how awesome you are with the world, so we have built certain features to enable this.\nOur App is designed to make it easier for you to connect with other Users and to interact with them.</p>\n<p>When using the Bumble App, you should assume that <b>anything</b> you post or submit on the App may be publicly-viewable and accessible, both by Users and non-users of the App.\nWe want our Users to be careful about posting information that may eventually be made public.</p>\n<p>Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on your profile such as your religious denomination and health details.\nYou may also choose to add sensitive information about yourself when you add certain Bumble badges to your profile, such as your religion and political leanings.\nWhile you may voluntarily provide this information to us when you create your profile, including your sexual preferences, there is no requirement to do so.\nPlease remember that photographs that you post on Bumble may reveal information about yourself as well.\n<b>Where you do upload and choose to tell us sensitive information about yourself, including through the addition of badges to your profile, you are explicitly consenting to our processing of this information and making it public to other Users.</b>\n</p>\n<p>Your Bumble profile and other information you make available via the App, including certain information added to your profile through third party accounts (such as Facebook, Instagram or Spotify \u2013 see section 7 of this Privacy Policy for more information about this) may be viewed and shared by Users with individuals who may or may not be users of the App.\nFor example, a User may recommend you as a match to his or her Facebook friend(s) by taking a screenshot of your profile picture and sharing it, regardless of whether such friend(s) is also a User of the App.</p>\n<p>Please also note that in certain countries (currently, South Korea only), Users are provided with functionality enabling them to download a copy of their conversation history (as this is required by local laws) and that Bumble has no control over how users may then publish or use that information.</p>\n<p>If you log in to or access the App through your

use the App - sorry kids, we know Bumble is cool, but you\u2019ll have to come back when you\u2019re old enough!</p>\n<p>Bumble does not knowingly collect any information about or market to children, minors or anyone under the age of 18.\nIf you are less than 18 years old, we request that you do not submit information to us.\nIf we become aware that a child, minor or anyone under the age of 18 has

appropriate security measures to help protect your information against loss, misuse and unauthorised access, or disclosure.\nWe use reasonable security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information such as secured servers using firewalls.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, no website or Internet transmission is ever completely 100% secure and even we cannot guarantee that unauthorised access, hacking, data loss or other breaches will never occur, but here are some handy tips to help keep your data secure:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Please make sure you log out of your Account after use as you never know who may stumble onto your Account!</li>\n<li>Please don\u2019t share the password you use to access your Bumble Account with anyone else!</li>\n<li>Change your password periodically.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you ever think someone has had access to your password or Account, please follow the steps set out here.\nWe cannot guarantee the security of your personal data while

accounts to your Bumble account <p>You may link your Bumble account with your Instagram, Facebook or Spotify accounts.\nThis allows you to share some information from those accounts directly to your Bumble account (for example, Instagram photos, or your top Spotify artists).</p>\n<p>We only receive the limited information that Instagram or Spotify permits to be transferred (as detailed by Instagram/Facebook/Spotify and agreed by you when you first connect your account from such platforms with your Bumble account).</p>\n<p>If you no longer want to link your Bumble account to your Instagram, Facebook or Spotify account, please visit the settings in your Instagram, Facebook or Spotify account and follow the instructions to remove the Bumble app access permissions.\nPlease note that any information already added to your Bumble account from those platforms will not be deleted unless you delete it within your Bumble account as well.</p>\n8.\nINFORMATION FOR BFF MEMBERS.\n<p>If you use BFF, you can populate your profile with information (like your beliefs and political leanings).\nYou can provide this information as part of your profile, but there\u2019s no obligation to do so.</p>\n<p>You should assume that whatever information you share in BFF, including which Hives you\u2019ve joined, can be seen by any BFF member.\nPlease note BFF members will not be able to see chat discussions until they join the specific chat and when they join, they\u2019ll see the full chat history.</p>\nHow we process personal data in BFF and our legal bases for processing\n<p>We offer the opportunity in BFF to join Hives built around locations or topics.\nWe\u2019ll automatically recommend Hives you can join based on your location, activity, \u201cmy life\u201d and \u201cmy interests\u201d information.</p>\n<p>The processing of your location data is necessary in order to perform our contract with you and deliver the Hives service to you.</p>\n<p>The processing of your profile and activity information in order to make Hive recommendations is based on our legitimate interests.\nIt is in our legitimate interests to use this information to recommend relevant Hives to you.</p>\n<p>Please note that if you upload and choose to share sensitive information (such as sexuality and beliefs), you are explicitly consenting to sharing that information with other BFF members.</p>\nPublic Spaces <p>Remember that certain areas of BFF are public spaces that are freely open to everyone on BFF.\nYour activity and anything you post in these spaces can be seen by everyone on Bumble BFF.</p>\n9.\nYOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS.\n<p>For Users who are California residents, you have the following rights (in addition to those listed at section 10 below) under the

agreement with us.</p>\n4.\nPRIVACY <p>For information about how the Bumble Group collects, uses, and shares your personal data, please check out our Privacy Policy.\nBy using Bumble, you acknowledge that we may use such data in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>\n5.\nPAYMENT TERMS <p>\n<b>Generally.</b>\n</p>\n<p>Bumble may offer products and services for purchase on the App (\u201cIn-App Purchase\u201d).\nIf you choose to make an In-App Purchase, you acknowledge and agree that additional terms, disclosed to you at the point of purchase, may apply, and that such additional terms are incorporated herein by reference.\n</p>\n<p>You may make an In-App Purchase through the following payment methods (\u201cPayment Method\u201d): (a) making a purchase through a third-party platform such as the Apple App Store and Google Play Store (\u201cThird Party Store\u201d), or (b) paying with your credit card, debit card, or PayPal account, which will be processed by a third-party processor.\nOnce you have made an In-App Purchase, you authorise us to charge your chosen Payment Method.\nIf payment is not received by us from your chosen Payment Method, you agree to promptly pay all amounts due upon demand by us.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Subscriptions and Auto-Renewal:</b> Bumble may offer some services as automatically-renewing subscriptions, e.g., a one-week subscription, one-month subscription, or three-month subscription (\u201cPremium Services\u201d).\n<b>IF YOU PURCHASE AN AUTOMATICALLY RENEWING SUBSCRIPTION, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL RENEW AT THE END OF THE PERIOD, UNLESS YOU CANCEL, AT BUMBLE\u2019S THEN-CURRENT PRICE FOR SUCH SUBSCRIPTIONS.</b> To avoid charges for a new subscription period, you must cancel, as described below, before the end of the then-current subscription period.\nDeleting your account or deleting the application from your device does not cancel your subscription.\nYou will be given notice of changes in the pricing of the Premium Services to which you have subscribed and an opportunity to cancel.\nIf Bumble changes these prices and you do not cancel your subscription, you agree that you will be charged at Bumble\u2019s then-current pricing for subscription.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Cancelling Subscriptions.</b> If you purchased a subscription directly from Bumble, you may cancel or change your Payment Method via the payment settings option under your profile.\nIf you purchased a subscription through a Third Party Store, such as the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store, you will need to access your account with that Third Party Store and follow instructions to change or cancel your subscription.\nIf you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of the period you last paid for, but (i) you will not (except as set forth in the subsection entitled \u201cRefunds\u201d below) be eligible for a prorated refund, (ii) your subscription will not be renewed when that period expires and (iii) you will then no longer be able to use the Premium Services or In-App Purchases enabled by your subscription.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Free Trials.</b> If you sign up for a free trial and do not cancel, your trial may convert into a paid subscription and your Payment Method will be charged at the then-current price for such subscription.\nOnce your free trial converts to a paid subscription, your paid subscription will continue to automatically renew at the end of each period, and your Payment Method will be charged, until you cancel.\nTo avoid charges for a new subscription period, you must cancel before the end of the then-current subscription period or free trial period as described above.\nDeleting your account or deleting the application from your device does not cancel your free trial.\nIf you have signed up for a free trial on Bumble through the Apple Store or Google Play Store previously, you will not be eligible for another free trial and you will then be automatically signed up to a subscription and charged as described in this paragraph.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Refunds.\nGenerally, all charges for purchases are nonrefundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods.\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>For subscribers residing in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin, the terms below apply:</p>\n<p>You may cancel your subscription, without penalty or obligation, at any time prior to midnight of the third business day following the date you subscribed.\nIn the event that you die before the end of your subscription period, your estate shall be entitled to a refund of that portion of any payment you had made for your subscription which is allocable to the period after your death.\nIn the event that you become disabled (such that you are unable to use Bumble) before the end of your subscription period, you shall be entitled to a refund of that portion of any payment you had made for your subscription which is allocable to the period after your disability by providing the company notice in the same manner as you request a refund as described below.</p>\n<p>To request a refund:</p>\n<p>In addition to cancelling, you must request a refund to receive one.\nIf you subscribed using your Apple ID, refunds are handled by Apple, not Bumble.\nTo request a refund, go to iTunes, click on your Apple ID, select \u201cPurchase history,\u201d find the transaction and hit \u201cReport Problem\u201d.\nYou can also submit a request at https://getsupport.apple.com.</p>\n<p>For all other purchases: please contact customer support with your order number (you can find the order number in the order confirmation email, or if you purchased from the Google Play Store by logging in to Google Wallet).\nYou may also mail or deliver a signed and dated notice which states that you, the buyer, are canceling this agreement, or words of similar effect.\nPlease also include the email address or mobile number associated with your account along with your order number.\nThis notice shall be sent to: Bumble, Attn.: Cancellations, P.O.\nBox 300940, Austin, Texas, 78703 (in addition, California and Ohio members may send a facsimile to 512-696-1545).</p>\n<p>\n<b>Taxes.</b>\n</p>\n<p>The payments required under this Section 5 do not include any Sales Tax that may be due in connection with the Premium Services provided under these Terms.\nIf Bumble determines it has a legal obligation to collect a Sales Tax from you in connection with these Terms, Bumble will collect such Sales Tax in addition to the payments required under this Section 5.\nIf any Premium Services, or payments for any Premium Services, under these Terms are subject to any Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax to Bumble, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority.\nAs used herein, \u201cSales Tax\u201d means any sales or use tax and any other tax measured by sales proceeds that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.</p>\n6.\nVIRTUAL ITEMS <p>At times, you may be able to purchase a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable licence to access special limited-use features from Bumble, referred to here as \u201cVirtual Items.\u201d You can only purchase Virtual Items through Bumble or Bumble\u2019s partners.\nVirtual Items represent a limited license right governed by this Agreement, and, except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, no title or ownership in or to Virtual Items is being transferred or assigned to you.\nThis Agreement, and your purchase of Virtual Items, does not constitute the sale of any rights in Virtual Items.</p>\n<p>Any Virtual Item balance shown in your account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead shows the extent of your licence to access Virtual Items.\nVirtual Items do not incur fees for non-use.\nYour licence in Virtual Items will terminate on the earlier of Bumble ceasing provision of services or your account closing or terminating.\nBumble may also at times provide Virtual Items as bonuses to, or parts of, paid subscriptions for its services.\nYour ability to use Virtual Items you have access to in this manner may terminate at the end of each of your subscription periods and your access to Virtual Items may not \u201croll over\u201d or accumulate through additional subscription periods.\nYour access to Virtual Items gained through subscriptions may also end if you cancel your subscription.</p>\n<p>Bumble, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to charge fees for the right to access or use Virtual Items and/or may distribute Virtual Items with or without charge.\nBumble may manage, regulate, control, modify, or eliminate Virtual Items at any time, including taking actions that may impact the perceived value or purchase price, if applicable, of any Virtual Items and Bumble shall have no liability to you for doing so.\nYou shall not sell, redeem, or otherwise transfer Virtual Items to any person or entity.\nVirtual Items may only be redeemed through our Services.</p>\n<p>ALL PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF VIRTUAL ITEMS MADE THROUGH OUR SERVICES ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE.\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BUMBLE IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.</p>\n7.\nPUSH NOTIFICATIONS.\nLOCATION-BASED FEATURES <p>We may provide you with emails, text messages, push notifications, alerts and other messages related to the App and/or the Bumble services, such as enhancements, offers, products, events, and other promotions.\nAfter downloading the App, you will be asked to accept or deny push notifications/alerts.\nIf you deny, you will not receive any push notifications/alerts.\nIf you accept, push notifications/alerts will be automatically sent to you.\nIf you no longer wish to receive push notifications/alerts from the App, you may opt out by changing your notification settings on your mobile device.\nWith respect to other types of messaging or communications, such as emails, text messages, etc., you can unsubscribe or opt out by either following the specific instructions included in such communications, or by emailing us with your request at feedback@team.bumble.com.</p>\n<p>The App may allow access to or make available opportunities for you to view certain content and receive other products, services and/or other materials based on your location.\nTo make these opportunities available to you, the App will determine your location using one or more reference points, such as GPS, Bluetooth and/or software within your mobile device.\nIf you have set your mobile device to disable GPS, Bluetooth or other location determining software or do not authorise the App to access your location data, you will not be able to access such location-specific content, products, services and materials.\nFor more about how the App uses and retains your information, please read the Privacy Policy.</p>\n8.\nDISCLAIMER <p>THE APP, SITE, OUR CONTENT, AND MEMBER CONTENT ARE ALL PROVIDED TO YOU \u201cAS IS\u201d AND \u201cAS AVAILABLE\u201d WITHOUT

OR SITE, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO STOP YOUR USE OF THE APP AND SITE.\n</p>\n<p>YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE APP OR SITE.\nBECAUSE SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES, THESE PROVISIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\nIF ANY PORTION OF THIS LIMITATION ON LIABILITY IS FOUND TO BE INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE FOR ANY REASON, THEN OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100).</p>\n<p>THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY HEREIN IS A FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT OF THE

Store.\nTo the extent that the other terms and conditions of these Terms are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict with, the terms and conditions of this Section, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions in this Section will apply, but solely with respect to the App and the Third Party Store.\nYou acknowledge and agree that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>These Terms are concluded solely between you and the Bumble Group and not with the providers of the Third Party Store, and the Bumble Group (and not the Third Party Store providers) is solely responsible for the App and the content thereof.\nTo the extent that these Terms provide for usage rules for the App which are less restrictive or in conflict with the applicable terms of service of the Third Party Store from which you obtain the App, the more restrictive or conflicting term of the Third Party Store will take precedence and will apply.</li>\n<li>The Third Party Store provider has no obligation whatsoever to provide any maintenance and support services with respect to the App.\nThe Bumble Group is solely responsible for any product warranties, whether express or implied by law, to the extent not effectively disclaimed.\nThe Third Party Store provider will have no warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be the sole responsibility of the Bumble Group.</li>\n<li>The Bumble Group, not the Third Party Store provider, is responsible for

arbitration agreement in this Section (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) carefully.\nUnless you opt out in the manner described in subsection 7 below, this agreement requires you to arbitrate disputes with Bumble Group and limits the manner in which you seek relief from us.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.\nWhen Does This Arbitration Agreement Apply?</b> This Arbitration Agreement applies to any dispute or claim relating to your use of our App or any other aspect of your relationship with Bumble Group.\nIt requires that, and by entering into these Terms you agree, that such claims will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (i) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.\nand (ii) you or Bumble Group may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.\nHow Do You Start The Arbitration Process?</b> To begin the arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent: CT Corporation, 1209 Orange Street, City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, Delaware 19801.</p>\n<p>\n<b>3.\nWhat Are The Rules Of Arbitration?</b> The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.\nThe arbitration will be governed by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider.\nDisputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys\u2019 fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS\u2019 most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at: http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/.\nAll other claims will be subject to JAMS\u2019 most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at: http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.\nJAMS\u2019 rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.\nIf JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.\nIf the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS\u2019 filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Bumble Group will pay them for you.\nIn addition, Bumble Group will reimburse all such JAMS\u2019 filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.</p>\n<p>You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.</p>\n<p>\n<b>4.\nWhat Can The Arbitrator Decide?</b> The arbitrator has the exclusive authority to (i) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, and (ii) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.\nThe arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.\nThe arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum\u2019s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement).\nThe arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.\nThe arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.\nThe award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.</p>\n<p>\n<b>5.\nNo Jury Trials.</b> By agreeing to arbitration, YOU AND BUMBLE GROUP ARE EACH AGREEING TO WAIVE OUR RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL.\nInstead, you and Bumble Group are electing that all claims and disputes will be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as described in Section 13(1) above.\nAn arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would.\nHowever, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p>\n<p>\n<b>6.\nOne At A Time.</b> All claims and disputes within the scope of this Arbitration Agreement MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR ANY OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING.\nOnly individual relief is available, and claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or consolidated with those of any other customer or user.\nThe arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.\nIf a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection\u2019s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then the claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in Travis County, Texas.\nAll other claims shall be arbitrated.</p>\n<p>\n<b>7.\n31-Day Right to Opt.\nThis opt out section does not apply to new members after January 18, 2021.</b> You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: <b>bumbleoptout@team.bumble.com</b>, within 31 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.\nYour notice must include your name and address, your Bumble username (if any), the email address you used to set up your Bumble account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.\nIf you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.\nOpting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.</p>\n<p>\n<b>8.\nSeverability.</b> Except as provided in subsection 13(6), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p>\n<p>\n<b>9.\nSurvival of Agreement.</b> The terms of this Arbitration Agreement will continue, even after your relationship with Bumble Group has ended.</p>\n14.\nUSE OF THIRD PARTY INTEGRATIONS <p>If you use the Snap Lenses feature offered in our App or any other AR features provided by Snap similar to Snap Lenses, you will be subject to the Snap Inc.\nTerms of Service, which contain an arbitration clause including a waiver of any right to participate in a class-action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.\nIf you do not agree to be subject to the Snap Inc.\nTerms of Service, you should not use the Snap-provided AR camera features within our App.</p>\n15.\nTERMINATION AND REMEDIES <p>These Terms commence on the date you accept them (as described in the preamble) and

shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your Account.</p>\n<p>In the event that Bumble Group determines, in its sole discretion, that you have breached any portion of these Terms, or have otherwise demonstrated conducted inappropriate for the App, Bumble Group reserves the right to: (a) warn you via email (to any email addresses you have provided to Bumble Group) that you have violated the Terms.\n(b) delete your User Content.\n(c) discontinue your Account.\n(d) discontinue your subscription(s).\n(e) notify and/or send your User Content to and/or fully cooperate with the proper law enforcement authorities for further action.\nand/or (f) pursue to any other action which Bumble Group deems to be appropriate.</p>\n<p>Termination of these Terms or your Account includes the removal of access to your Account, and all related information and content associated with or inside your Account.</p>\n<p>All provisions of these Terms, which by their nature should survive, shall survive termination of these Terms, including, without limitation, the Arbitration Agreement, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers and limitation of liability.</p>\n16.\nMISCELLANEOUS <p>There are a few more things we need to mention before you can use Bumble.</p>\n<p>These Terms, which we may amend from time to time, constitute the entire agreement between you and the Bumble Group.\nThe Terms supersede all previous agreements, representations and arrangements between us (written or oral), excluding the Privacy Policy.\nNothing in this clause shall limit or exclude any liability for fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p>The Bumble Group has taken reasonable steps to ensure the currency, availability, correctness and completeness of

items: <p>If, for any reason, any of the Terms are declared illegal, invalid or otherwise unenforceable by a court of a competent jurisdiction, then to the extent that term is illegal, invalid or unenforceable, it shall be severed and deleted from the Terms and the remainder of the Terms shall survive, remain in full force and effect and continue to be binding and enforceable.</p>\n<p>No failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege under the Terms shall operate as a waiver of such right or acceptance of any variation of the Terms and nor shall any single or partial
