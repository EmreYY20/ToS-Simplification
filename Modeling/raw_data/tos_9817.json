long as we have a reason to keep it.</li>\n<li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search

products or services that have a separate privacy policy.</p>\n<p>Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.</p> Information We Collect <p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so\u2013for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.</p>\n<p>We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources.\nLet\u2019s go over the information that we collect.</p> Information You Provide to Us <p>It\u2019s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us.\nThe amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information.\nHere are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Basic Account Information:</strong> We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account.\nFor example, we require individuals who sign up for a GGather account to provide a password, a username and email address\u2013and that\u2019s it.\nYou may provide us with more information\u2013like your name\u2013but we don\u2019t require that information to create a GGather.com account.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Public Profile Information:</strong> If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile.\nFor example, if you have a GGather account, your username is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, such as a photo or an \u201cAbout Me\u201d description.\nYour public profile information is just that\u2013public\u2013so please keep that in mind when deciding what

disclose information related to the emergency without delay.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that GGather goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired

<p>Information that you choose to make public is\u2013you guessed it\u2013disclosed publicly.</p>\n<p>That means, of course, that information like your public profile, posts, other content that you make public on your website, and your \u201cLikes\u201d, \"Saves\", \"Favorites\" and comments on other websites, are all available to others\u2013and we hope you get a lot of views!</p>\n<p>Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.</p>\n<p>Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share.</p> How Long We Keep Information <p>We generally discard information about you when we no longer need the information for the purposes for which we collect and use it\u2013which are described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information\u2013and we are not legally required to continue to keep it.</p>\n<p>For example, we keep the web server logs that record information about a visitor to one of GGather\u2019s websites, such as the visitor\u2019s IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 60 days.\nWe retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to GGather\u2019s websites and investigate issues if something goes wrong on one of our websites.</p>\n<p>As another example, sometimes when you delete an item from your GGather account, it may stay in your Trash folder for thirty days just in case you change your mind and would like restore that content\u2013because starting again from scratch is no fun, at all.\nAfter the thirty days are up, the deleted content may remain on our backups and caches until purged.</p> Security <p>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so, such as monitoring our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.</p>\n<p>To enhance the security of your

GGather\u2019s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Close Your Account:</strong> While we\u2019d be very sad to see you go, if you no longer want to use our Services :( :( :( :(, you can close your GGather.com account.\nPlease keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after closing your account, as described in How Long We Keep
