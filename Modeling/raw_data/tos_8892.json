of our Services may be subject to payments now or in the future (the \u201cPaid Services\u201d).\nPlease see our Paid Services page for a description of the current Paid Services.\nPlease note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing up for a Paid Service are deemed part of these Terms.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>b.\nBilling.\nWe use a third-party payment processor (the \u201cPayment Processor\u201d) to bill you through a payment account linked to your account on the Services (your \u201cBilling Account\u201d) for use of the Paid Services.\nThe processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to these Terms.\nWe are not responsible for error by the Payment Processor.\nBy choosing to use Paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your \u201cPayment Method\u201d).\nYou agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method.\nWe reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processor makes even if it has already requested or received payment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>c.\nPayment Method.\nThe terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method.\nIf we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>d.\nRecurring Billing.\nSome of the Paid Services may consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you.\nBy choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such Services have an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation.\nWE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD.\nSUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT.\nTO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, GO TO ACCOUNT SETTINGS.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>e.\nCurrent Information Required.\nYOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT.\nYOU MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD.\nCHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE AT ACCOUNT SETTINGS.\nIF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>f.\nChange in Amount Authorized.\nIf the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction.\nAny agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method.\nYou agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>g.\nReaffirmation of Authorization.\nYour non-termination or continued use of a Paid Service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid Service.\nWe may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges.\nThis does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you.\nYour charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid Service.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Free Trials and Other Promotions.\nAny free trial or other promotion that provides access to a Paid Service must be used within the specified time of the trial.\nYou must stop using a Paid Service before the end of the trial period in order to avoid being charged for that Paid Service.\nIf you cancel prior to the end of the trial period and are inadvertently charged for a Paid Service, please contact us at support@fleek.co.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What if I want to stop using the Services?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You\u2019re free to do that at any time, by contacting us at support@fleek.co.\nplease

Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination.\nBy way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us, including without limitation the arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What else do I need to know?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Warranty Disclaimer.\nNeither Fleek nor its licensors or suppliers make any representations or warranties concerning any content contained in or accessed through the

CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL FLEEK (OR ITS LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS) BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR (B) ANY AMOUNT, IN THE AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF (I) $100 OR (II) THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO FLEEK IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THIS APPLICABLE CLAIM, OR (C) ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL.\nSOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Indemnity.\nTo the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, You agree to indemnify and hold Fleek, its affiliates, officers, agents, employees, and partners harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) arising from or in any way related to any third party claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation of these Terms.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Assignment.\nYou may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without Terminal\u2019s prior written consent.\nWe may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Choice of Law.\nThese Terms are governed by and will be construed under the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Arbitration Agreement.\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH FLEEK AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.\nBoth you and Fleek acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, Terminal\u2019s officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (\u201cPersonnel\u201d) are third party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third party beneficiary hereof.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(a) Arbitration Rules.\nApplicability of Arbitration Agreement.\nAny dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in New York, New York.\nThe arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.\n(\u201cJAMS\u201d) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules.\nJudgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(b) Costs of Arbitration.\nThe JAMS rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.\nFleek will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $75,000.\nFleek will not seek its attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(c) Small Claims Court.\nFurthermore, either you or Fleek may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in New York, New York or any United States county where you live or work.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(d) Waiver of Jury Trial.\nYOU AND FLEEK WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY.\nYou and Fleek are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration.\nArbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.\nIn any litigation between you and Fleek over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND FLEEK WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(e) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.\nALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS.\nCLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.\nIf however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration.\ninstead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(f) Opt-out.\nYou have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: 12-16 Vestry St 4th fl New York, NY 10013 postmarked within 30 days of first accepting these Terms.\nYou must include (1) your name and residence address.\n(2) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account.\nand (3) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms\u2019 arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(g) Exclusive Venue.\nIf you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Fleek to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party and both you and Fleek agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, New York, New York, or the Southern District of New York.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Miscellaneous.\nYou will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that the Fleek may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit.\nThe failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.\nIf any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.\nYou and Fleek agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Fleek, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms,.\nYou hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Fleek, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Fleek in any respect whatsoever.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Except as expressly set forth in the section above regarding the arbitration agreement, you and Fleek agree there are no third party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.</p>\n<p>PRODUCT</p>\n<p>IPFS
