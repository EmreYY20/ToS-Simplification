addresses.</p>\n<p>Data We Collect Automatically: When you interact with us through the Services, we receive and store certain information such as an IP address, device ID, and your activities within the Services.\nWe may store such information or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by affiliates, agents or service providers.\nThe Services may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of messages users have sent, as well as the sites which refer visitors to us.</p>\n<p>We may also conduct research on our customer demographics, interests and behaviour based on the information collected.\nThis research may be compiled and analysed on an aggregate basis, and we may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents and business partners.\nWe may also disclose anonymous aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>\n<p>You may give us permission to collect your information in other services.\nFor example, you may connect a social networking service (\"SNS\") such as Facebook or Twitter to your Dbots account.\nWhen you do this, it allows us to obtain information from those accounts (for example, your friends or contacts).</p>\n<p>We employ cookies and similar technologies to keep track of your local computer\u2019s settings such as which account you have logged into and notification settings.\nCookies are pieces of data that sites and services can set on your browser or device that can be read on future visits.\nWe may expand our use of cookies to save additional data as new features are added to the Service.\nIn

as Google Analytics on our website that employ cookies to collect certain information concerning your use of our Services.\nHowever, you can disable cookies by changing your browser settings.\nFurther

Europe and other countries.</p>\n<p>Use of information</p>\n<p>We use the information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.\nIf you provide information for a certain reason, we may use the information in connection with the reason for which it was provided.\nFor instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the information you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem.\nAlso, if you provide information in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your information to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services.\nThe Company and its affiliates may also use your information collected through the Services to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better understand our users and to improve the Services.\nThe Company and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you.\nIf we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to \"opt-out\" of receiving future marketing communications.\nIn addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.</p>\n<p>Legal</p>\n<p>Our main reason for the processing of personal data is to meet our contractual obligations to our users, or to take steps at users\u2019 request in anticipation of entering into a contract with them.\nFor example, we handle personal data on this basis to create your account and provide our Services.</p>\n<p>We handle personal data on the ground that it furthers our legitimate interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals.\nThis includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Providing a safe and enjoyable user experience;</li>\n<li>Customer service;</li>\n<li>Marketing, e.g.\nsending emails or other communications to let you know about new features;</li>\n<li>Protecting our users, personnel, and property;</li>\n<li>Analysing and improving our business, e.g.\ncollecting information about how you use our Services to optimize the design and placement of certain features;</li>\n<li>Processing job applications;</li>\n<li>Managing legal issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where required by law, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of your implied or express consent.</p>\n<p>Disclosure of information</p>\n<p>The Company is not in the business of selling your information.\nWe consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you.\nThere are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your information with certain third parties, as set forth below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets.\nIn the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, bankruptcy, dissolution or similar event, your information may be part of the transferred assets.</li>\n<li>Consent: We may transfer your information with your consent.</li>\n<li>Related Companies: We may also share your information with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>\n<li>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: Like many businesses, we sometimes hire other companies or individuals to perform certain business-related functions.\nExamples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments.</li>\n<li>Legal Requirements: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of the Company or Related Companies, (iii) protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.</li>\n<li>Aggregated or Non-identifiable Data: We may also share aggregated or non-personally identifiable information with our partners or others for business purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may provide us with ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, \u201cUnsolicited Information\u201d).\nAll Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and we shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited Information to others without limitation or attribution.</p>\n<p>Third parties</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services.\nThe Services may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by us (the \u201cThird Party Sites\u201d).\nThe policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites.\nThe links from the Services do not imply that we endorse or have reviewed the Third Party Sites.\nWe suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.</p>\n<p>Data retention</p>\n<p>We generally retain personal data for so long as it may be relevant to the purposes identified herein.\nTo dispose of personal data, we may anonymize it, delete it or take other appropriate steps.\nData may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for additional time.</p>\n<p>Security</p>\n<p>We take all reasonable steps to protect the information provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.\nHowever, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free.</p>\n<p>Your rights</p>\n<p>We believe that users should be treated equally no matter where they are, and so we are making the following options to control your data available to all users, regardless of their location.\nYou can update certain information by accessing your profile via \u201cSettings.\u201d You can also unsubscribe from certain emails by clicking the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d link they contain.\nYou can also opt out from certain cookie-related processing.\nIndividuals in the European Economic Area, Canada, Costa Rica and some other jurisdictions outside the United States have certain legal rights to obtain confirmation of whether we hold personal data about them, to access personal data we hold about them (including, in some cases, in portable form), and to obtain its correction, update, amendment or deletion in appropriate circumstances.\nThey may also object to our uses or disclosures of personal data, to request a restriction on its processing, or withdraw any consent, though such actions typically will not have retroactive effect.\nThey also will not affect our ability to continue processing data in lawful ways.</p>\n<p>How can I access the personal data you have about me?</p>\n<p>If you would like to submit a data access request, you can do so by sending us an email to privacy@top.gg or from the \u201cSettings\u201d page of the Services (where applicable).\nWe will then start the process and provide you a link to access the personal data that we have on you within 30 days.</p>\n<p>How do I correct, update, amend, or delete the personal data you have about me?</p>\n<p>In addition to the functionality available through the \u201cSettings\u201d of the Services or an email request, in which you can correct, update, amend, or delete certain personal data, you can also request other modifications from us directly.\nPlease write us at privacy@top.gg with an explanation of what data subject right you are seeking to exercise.\nFor your protection, we may take steps to verify identity before responding to your request.</p>\n<p>How do I object or restrict the manner in which Dbots processes my personal data?</p>\n<p>You have a right to ask us to stop using or limit our use of your personal data in certain circumstances\u2014for example, if we have no lawful basis to keep using your data, or if you think your personal data is inaccurate.\nDbots offers you the ability to restrict the processing of your data for specific uses, which you can find in the \u201cSettings\u201d page of the services.\nIndividuals in the European Economic Area have the right to opt out of all of our processing of their personal data for direct marketing purposes.\nTo exercise this right, please see the \u201cSettings\u201d page for your Account (where applicable) or send us an email.\nYou may also click the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d link in any of our marketing emails.\nThe rights and options described above are subject to limitations and exceptions under applicable law.\nIn addition to those rights, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority.\nHowever, we encourage you to contact us first, and we will do our very best to resolve your concern.</p>\n<p>Changes to the Policy</p>\n<p>We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our information practices.\nIf we make any material changes we will notify you by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective.\nWe encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>\n<p>Security</p>\n<p>Dbots takes reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access or against loss, misuse or alteration by third parties.\nAlthough we make good faith efforts to store the information collected on the Service in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of that information during its transmission or its storage on our systems.\nFurther, while we attempt to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party \"hackers\" from illegally obtaining access to this information.\nWe do not warrant or represent that your information will be protected against, loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties.\nNo method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.\nTherefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>\n<p>Our Policy Regarding Children</p>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to use our Service.\nIf you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address.\nNo one under the age of 13 may provide any personal information.\nIn the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.\nIf you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under the age of 13, please contact us at
