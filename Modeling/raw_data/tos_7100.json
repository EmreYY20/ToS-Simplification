non-modified form by other communities without\npermission by the author.\nIts purpose is to ensure a civilised,\ntolerant, compassionate, helpful, pluralistic and peaceful style of\ncommunication.</p>\nDesirable behaviour\n<ol>\n<li>If possible, providing help with issues other users may have.\nIf it suits the topic of the community, answer it in there, if it\ndoes not, try to link to a community where it is more topical.</li>\n<li>Accepting other opinions, even if you disagree.\nThis does not\nexclude the possibility to provide arguments for your own\nopinion.</li>\n<li>Pinging moderators by mentioning their names in chat in the\ncase of rule violations, especially trolling or spamming.\nWhile\ndoing so, do not quote or reply to the violator \u2014 the most valuable\nthing you can give trolls and spammers is extra attention by\nnon-moderators.</li>\n<li>In order to have your questions resolved more quickly and\nefficiently, see also: The XY\nproblem, Don't ask to\nask, No Hello and How to Ask Smart Questions</li>\n</ol>\nUndesirable behaviour\n<ol>\n<li>Talking about things that do not suit the topic of the\ncommunity.\nCommunities exempt from this rule will mention that in\ntheir descriptions.</li>\n<li>Attacking people rather than attacking their arguments (a.k.a.\nad hominem).</li>\n<li>Bringing extra attention by people who are not moderators to\ntrolls and spammers.</li>\n<li>Self-censorship for reasons of politeness or similar.\nAs long\nas you keep it civil and free of insults, it is desirable to\ndiscuss issues you have with people directly, rather than letting\nit build up and later creating drama.\nIt is in the interest of the\nmoderators to make the rooms feel comfortable for a large amount of\npeople, this includes changing their own behaviour where necessary\nand reasonable.\nIf you feel it is better to discuss in a smaller\ngroup, ask the person you have an issue with and/or a moderator\nwhether it is fine to invite them to a private chat.</li>\n<li>Making other users feel uncomfortable, for example by nagging\nthem with questions they have stated they do not want to\nanswer.</li>\n<li>Misgendering, deadnaming and assuming gender.\nUse the singular they and\ninclusive\nlanguage where possible.</li>\n<li>Not liking the community.\nIf you do, why don't you just leave?\nYou would be causing discomfort to everyone else as well if you did\nnot.</li>\n</ol>\nProhibited behaviour\n<ol>\n<li>Spreading hateful, violent or discriminatory ideologies or\nconspiracy theories, via images and other media (including avatars)\nor text (including nicknames), as well as discriminating against\nany group or person.\nThis includes the use of slurs.</li>\n<li>Spamming.\nThis includes adverts, large amounts of repetitive\nmessages, sending invites to users without asking (invite spam),\netc.</li>\n<li>Trolling.\nintentionally derailing conversations or producing\ndiscussions on non-issues.</li>\n<li>Doxing: The disclosure of others' private information without\ntheir consent.</li>\n<li>Posting content that may cause harm or be triggering to other\npeople without using an appropriate warning and the spoiler\nfeature.\nFor example, people with photosensitive epilepsy may\nexperience seizures from animations with rapidly changing or\nflashing colours, and people suffering from certain trauma may have\npainful memories triggered by talk about common triggers, such as\nviolence, sex, abuse, severe mental health issues, or drugs.</li>\n<li>Actively suppressing opinions of other users.</li>\n<li>Being an undesired bot (bots are undesired if not approved by\nmoderation), or adding an undesired bot to a community.</li>\n<li>Ban evasion (creation of additional accounts to join a\ncommunity after having been banned from that room).</li>\n<li>If you are a moderator or otherwise have permissions above\nthose of normal users: abusing your permissions for personal\nmotives not compatible with this code of conduct.</li>\n<li>Continued harrassment of other users.</li>\n<li>Posting explicit imagery (sexual content, displays of violence,\netc.) or unwanted sexual or romantic advances towards other\nusers.</li>\n<li>Posting content that is illegal to publish or illegal to\ndistribute without permission in Germany.\nThe reason is that in\ncertain cases, especially when it comes to copyright, the service\nprovider (who might be me), may be held liable, and I do not wish\nto get into legal trouble.</li>\n<li>Abusing loopholes in this code of conduct, for example doing\nsomething that is not explicitly covered by the prohibited\nbehaviour, yet is in conflict with the general idea of desirable\nbehaviour.</li>\n</ol>\nConsequences of violation\n<ol>\n<li>Undesirable behaviour will lead to warnings, and later on, if\nrepeated too often, kicks or bans.</li>\n<li>Prohibited behaviour will, in most cases, directly lead to a\nkick or ban.</li>\n<li>Any kind of violation can lead to removal of the offending\ncontent.</li>\n<li>When it becomes obvious that an entire server exists for a\npurpose such as violating this code of conduct, or the\nadministrator violates the code of conduct and/or refuses to\ndeactivate spammer accounts, the entire server can be banned.</li>\n<li>Kicks and bans apply to all communities administrated by\nme.</li>\n<li>If a moderator violates the code of conduct, make sure to point\nit out to me.\nThis can lead to warnings and demotion of the\nmoderator.</li>\n<li>If I myself violate the code of conduct, no such possibility of\nwarnings or demotion exists.\nThus, it is important to call me out,\nor make one of my friends or moderators call me out.\nFurther steps\nwill then be discussed ad hoc.</li>\n</ol>\nChanges to this code of conduct\n<p>This code of conduct may be changed in order to enhance clarity\nand precision at any time, typically without notification.</p> ", "created_at": "2022-12-12 07:19:38.18525", "updated_at": "2022-12-12 17:21:11.53744"}, {"id": 13212, "name": "Rimgo Privacy Policy", "url":
