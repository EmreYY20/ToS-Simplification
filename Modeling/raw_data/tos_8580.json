Privacy Policy <em>Last updated: June 18, 2023</em> The privacy of your data \u2014 and it is your data, not ours! \u2014 is a big deal to us.\nIn this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why.\nhow your data is handled.\nand your rights to your data.\nWe promise to never sell your data.\nWhen we say \"company\", \"we\", \"our, \"us\", \"Cassava\", \"application\", \"bot\", \"service\" or \"services\" in this document, we are referring to Cassavarose LLC.\nWhen we say \"platform\" in this document, we are referring to your integrations wtih Cassava which includes Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Webex.\nWhat we collect and why Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need and that we will solely process this information to provide you with the service you signed up for.\nWe use a select number of trusted external service providers for certain service offerings.\nThese service providers are carefully selected and meet high data protection, data privacy and security standards.\nWe only share information with them that is required for the services offered.\nHere\u2019s what all this means in practice: Identity &amp.\nAccess When you register for an account with Cassava, we request access to your platform and identity via OAuth or via direct installation by means of the App directory.\nYour platform provides one or more tokens to facilitate this process.\nAs part of registration, we obtain the bare minimum information regarding your account to allow us to authenticate and authorize your use of Cassava.\nWe collect your platform id, platform name, platform tokens, and scopes during authentication.\nDuring authorization we also collect your name, platform user id, user tokens, scopes, profile photo where available, as well as your locale and timezone when provided.\nAt any time you can invite members of your platform to collaborate on your Cassava Experiences, and in doing so we ask them to identify themselves by signing in to the platform.\nPeople outside your organization can also be invited to collaborate by providing a personal email address in exchange for a Magic Link token.\nThe purpose of self identification in each case is so that we can authenticate and authorize your use of Cassava.\nWe\u2019ll never sell your personal information to third parties, and we won\u2019t use your name or company in marketing statements without your permission.\nBilling Information When you purchase a recurring subscription to Cassava, we ask for your credit card and other billing information, so that we can charge you for service, calculate taxes due, and send you invoices.\nWe use Stripe as our payment processor and as such your credit card is passed directly to them from your browser and never goes through our servers.\nWe store a record of the payment transaction, including the last 4 digits of the credit card number for account history, invoicing, and billing support.\nGeolocation data We log all sign-ins to Cassava by full IP address so that we can verify no unauthorized access has been granted.\nWe keep this login data for as long as your account is active.\nWe also log the IP address at least once a day when an Experience is accessed by the same user to support auditing for unauthorized access.\nThis data is kept for long as your account is active.\nThe IP address of visitors to the blog who participate in conversations by providing their email and other profile information is tracked.\nSee our Terms of Service for how this information is used.\nNo such logging of IP addresses occurs for anonymous user visits to our website.\nWebsite Interactions We use Plausible Analytics, a GDPR, CCPA and cookie law compliant site analytics tool, to measure overall trends in the usage of our website.\nPlausible Analytics only collects aggregated information.\nNo cookies are used for Analytics and no Personal Identifiable Information (PII) such as your IP address or browser user agent is stored.\nYou are encouraged to view Plausible Analytics Data Policy and learn more about their Do Not Track Policy and other privacy tenets.\nAs you build content on Cassava, you may upload attachments to your Experience.\nThese attachments are uploaded directly to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and served from Amazon CloudFront.\nSee the AWS Privacy Policy for more information..\nFrom time to time we may send transactional emails to those users who authenticate with an email address.\nIn these instances we use Mailjet as our provider.\nSee the Mailjet Privacy Policy for more details.\nAs an added measure of privacy we do not track email open and click events in Mailjet.\nThese features are off.\nWe use CAPTCHA service as a means of spam protection on some of our forms.\nhCaptcha is a GDPR-compliant and privacy-friendly captcha.\nSee the hCaptcha Privacy Policy for full details.\nCookies When you sign into Cassava we store persistent first-party cookies in your browser for purpopses of authentication and authorization only.\nThese cookies are removed when they expire or when you sign out of Cassava.\nTo learn more about cookies, including how to view which cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, please visit www.allaboutcookies.org.\nWe also store a cookie when you leave a comment on the blog and select the <b>Remember me</b> option.\nThis cookie remains in place until expiration.\nVoluntary Crrespondence When you write Cassava with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including the email address, so that we have a history of past correspondences to reference if you reach out in the future.\nInformation we do not collect We don\u2019t collect any characteristics of protected classifications including age, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or physical and mental abilities or disabilities.\nWe also do not collect any biometric data.\nWe show whatever profile photo you have provided in your platform and do not extract any information from it.\nWhen we access or share your information Our default practice is to not access your information.\nThe only times we\u2019ll ever access or share your info are: <b>To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug which impacts your use of Cassava</b>.\nWhen you reach out to us for assistance in this matter you implicitly grant us the right to review your account to support debugging the issue.\n<b>To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding restricted uses</b>.\nAccessing a customer\u2019s account when investigating potential abuse is a measure of last resort.\nWe have an obligation to protect the privacy and safety of both our customers and the people reporting issues to us.\nWe do our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the process.\nIf we do discover you are using our products for a restricted purpose, we will report the incident to the appropriate authorities.\n<b>When required under applicable law</b>.\nCassavarose LLC is a US company.\nYour rights with respect to your information At Cassava, we apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location.\nCurrently some of the most privacy-forward regulations in place are the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) and California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) in the US.\nCassava recognizes all of the rights granted in these regulations, except as limited by applicable law.\nThese rights include: <b>Right to Know.</b> You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold.\nWe outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.\n<b>Right of Access.</b> This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.\n<b>Right to Correction.</b> You have the right to request correction of your personal information.\n<b>Right to Erasure / \u201cTo be Forgotten\u201d.</b> This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, all of our service providers.\nFulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using Casava services because our applications may then no longer work.\nIn such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.\n<b>Right to Complain.</b> You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority.\nTo identify your specific authority or find out more about this right, EU individuals should go to https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en.\n<b>Right to Restrict Processing.</b> This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of sale of personal information.\n(Again: we never will sell your personal data.) <b>Right to Object.</b> You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.\n<b>Right to Portability.</b> You have the right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.\n<b>Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making.</b> You have the right to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or similarly significant, effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes.\nThis right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.\n<b>Right to Non-Discrimination.</b> This right stems from the CCPA.\nWe do not and will not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights.\nHowever, the exercise of certain rights (such as the right \u201cto be forgotten\u201d) may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Services.\nIf you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at privacy@gocassava.com.\nFor requests to delete personal information or know what personal information has been collected, we will first verify your identity using a combination of at least two pieces of information already collected.\nIf an authorized agent is corresponding on your behalf, we will first need written consent with a signature from the account holder before proceeding.\nHow we secure your data All data is encrypted via SSL/TLS when transmitted to your browser from our servers hosted on Digital Ocean.\nAny OAuth tokens we received from you that are designated for storage in our database are first encrypted.\nAll live data in our database clusters is encrypted at rest with LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) and in transit with SSL.\nData held in routine backups are also encrypted.\nFurthermore, our database modeling architecture uses a Multitenant strategy to enforce the isolation of data within each account.\nSee Digital Ocean Privacy Policy for more information.\nWhat happens when you delete data in your account Unless otherwise stated, anything you delete in your Cassava Experiences is permanent and irreversible.\nWe prompt you to confirm your intention before performing costly deletions as a measure of precaution.\nWe also delete your data after an account is closed.\nLocation of site and data Cassava operates in the United States and as such the primary data you share with us is stored on servers provided by Digitial Ocean in the United States.\nRefer to the privacy policies of our third party providers for the location and storage of data.\nIf you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the United States, <b>please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to and stored in the United States</b>.\nBy using our Site, participating in any of our services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.\nData Retention We will retain your information as long as your account is active, as necessary to provide you with the services, or as otherwise outlined in this policy.\nWe will also retain and use this information as necessary for the purposes set out in this policy and to the extent required to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements and protect Cassavarose LLC's legal rights.\nYou can choose to delete your Cassava account at any time by making a request to Customer Support at support@gocassava.com.\nWe will review the request and direct you to the steps to proceed.\nUpon approval, we will permanently delete all your data in our live database when you delete your account.\nData in our backups may persist until those backups are purged.\nChanges &amp.\nquestions We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any new practices.\nWhenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will also announce them on our company blog.\nHave any questions, comments, or concerns about this privacy policy, your data, or your rights with respect to your information? Please get in touch by emailing us at privacy@gocassava.com and we\u2019ll be happy to answer them!
