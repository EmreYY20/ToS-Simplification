you, through our interactions with you, and how we use that data.</p>\n<p>Horizon Hobby offers a wide range of websites to assist customers across the globe.\nPlease read the site-specific details in this privacy statement, which provide additional details about some of Horizon Hobby's websites.</p>\n<p>You can freely access much of our websites without providing any personal information.\nBut certain functions of our website, for example purchasing products, entering contests, filling out surveys, and receiving newsletters, emails, or other promotional information from us, require that you submit some personal information.\nWe do not collect any personal information without providing adequate notice and choice.</p> 1.\nYour Rights Concerning Personally Identifiable Information <p>You always have the right to request information about your stored data, its origin, its recipients, and the purpose of its collection at no charge.\nYou also have the right to request that it be corrected, blocked, or deleted.\nYou can contact us at any time if you have further questions about privacy and data protection.</p>\nLearn More Privacy and Data Protection\n\u00d7 <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent.\nYou may revoke consent for these data processing operations at any time to stop future processing.\nAn informal email making this request is sufficient.\nThe data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed depending on the nature of the data and Horizon Hobby's legal requirements or legitimate interest in such data.</p>\n<p>You have the right to have data which we process based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract delivered to yourself or to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format.\nIf you require direct transfer of data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.\nHorizon Hobby may require reasonable actions of the requester, such as the use of confirmation codes, prior to delivery, to protect users' personal information from potential malicious third parties.If there has been a breach of data protection legislation, the person affected may file a complaint with the competent regulatory authorities.\nThe competent regulatory authority for matters related to data protection in the European Union is the data protection officer of the German state in which our subsidiary, Horizon Hobby GmbH, is headquartered, Schleswig-Holstein.\n</p> Close 2.\nNotice Concerning the Data Protection Officers and Party Responsible for Horizon Hobby Websites <p>The party responsible for processing data on our US-based websites intended for American and other non-European users, such as horizonhobby.com, towerhobbies.com, spektrumrc.com, axialracing.com, etc., is:</p> Horizon Hobby LLC<br>\n2904 Research Road<br>\nChampaign, IL<br>\n61822<br>\nContact <p>Our Data Protection Officer for these US-based sites is Ben Ambrose, who can be reached through the site contact form.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The part responsible for processing data on our EU-based websites intended for European users, such as horizonhobby.eu, horizonhobby.de, arrmarc.com etc., is:</p> Horizon Hobby GmbH<br>\nHanskampring 9<br>\nD-22885 Barsb\u00fcttel, Germany<br>\nPhone: +49-40-822167800 Contact <p>Our Data Protection Officer for these EU-based sites is Ben Ambrose, who can be reached through&nbsp;the site contact form.&nbsp;</p> 3.\nTypes of Data We Collect <p>Our goal is to provide you with the best and most efficient service as possible so you can get back to your hobbies.\nHorizon Hobby collects data to help us provide this service.\nWe use the data that we collect about you to fulfill your product and service purchases and to create a personalized online experience.\nIn order to better provide you with these products and services, our websites collect two types of information about users: Personally Identifiable and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</p>\nLearn More Personally Identifiable and Non-Personally Identifiable Information\n\u00d7 <p>We gather certain information about you based upon where you shop on our site in several ways.\nThis information is compiled and analyzed on both an individual and aggregated basis.\nFor example, this information may include the Uniform Resource Locator (\"URL\") of the website you came from, the URL you go to next, the browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address.\nA URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web.\nAn IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (\"TCP/IP\") network, such as the World Wide Web.\nNetworks like the Web use TCP/IP to route information based on the IP address of the destination.\nIn other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web and allows web servers to locate and identify your computer.\nComputers require IP addresses for users to communicate on the Internet, browse, and shop.</p> Personal Data We Collect <p>Personal information is requested when you order a product, register for a Wish List, enter contests or sweepstakes, fill out surveys, send us feedback, and send us mailings.\nFor example, this information might include but is not limited to your name, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, email address, credit card or other payment information, and product details.\nWith this information, our online catalog can fill your orders and better provide you with personalized services.</p>\n<p>Most personal information collected by Horizon Hobby is necessary for completion of purchase orders.\nOther personal data is collected with your consent.\nHorizon Hobby works to provide users with as much relevant information as possible prior to collecting any personal data.</p>\n<p>Under certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose your personal information in response to valid requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p> Close 4.\nHow We Collect and Use Data Cookies <p>Some of our web pages include cookies.\nYou can configure your browser to selectively or always reject cookies.\nBut

text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.\nCookies do not harm your computer and do not contain any viruses.\nMost of the cookies we use are session cookies that are automatically deleted after your visit.\nOther cookies make it possible to recognize your browser when you next visit the site.</p>\n<p>You can configure your browser or browser plug-ins to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie.\nAlso, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain

privacy policy.</p> Server Log Files <p>The website provider automatically collects and stores information that your browser automatically transmits to us in server log files.\nThese include the type and version of your browser, operating system used, referrer URL, the hostname of the accessing computer, time of the server request, and IP address.\nThese data are not combined with data from other sources.\nThe basis for data processing is GDPR Art.\n6(1)(b), which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract.</p> Contact Forms <p>Should you send us questions via the contact form, we will collect the data entered on the form, including the contact details you provide to answer your question and any follow-up questions.\nWe do not share this information without your permission.\nTherefore, we will process data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent under GDPR Art.\n6(1)(a).\nYou may revoke your consent at any time by sending an informal request via the site contact form.\nWe will retain the data you provide on the contact form until you request its deletion, revoke your consent for its storage, or the purpose of its storage ceases to exist.\nMandatory provisions, especially mandatory data retention periods, remain unaffected by this provision.</p> Registration on Horizon Hobby Websites <p>Some Horizon Hobby

site contact form.\nWe will continue to store the data collected during registration for as long as you remain registered on our website.\nMandatory provisions, especially mandatory data retention periods, remain unaffected by this provision.</p>\nLearn More Registration Data\n\u00d7 <p>The mandatory information requested during registration must be provided in full.\nOtherwise, we will reject

your email address will be stored along with your comment, as well as your username, unless you are posting anonymously.\nOur comment or review function may store the IP address of those users who posted.\nWe need this information to be able to pursue actions for illegal or slanderous content.\nThe comments and reviews are stored based on your consent under GDPR Art.\n6(1)(a).\nYou may revoke your consent at any time by sending an informal email request via the site contact form.\nMandatory provisions, especially mandatory data retention periods or obligations to maintain records</p>\nLearn More Comment Data\n\u00d7 <p>On some Horizon Hobby websites, you may be able to sign up to receive the comment feed after registering or commenting.\nYour email address may be checked with a confirmation email.\nYou can unsubscribe from this function at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in the emails.\nThe data provided by subscribing to the comments feed will be deleted.\nBut if you have submitted comments or provided the data to us for another purpose or elsewhere, those comments or data will not be deleted.\nYou may request deletion of this data by sending an informal email request request via the site contact form</p> Close Plugins <p>Some Horizon Hobby websites have social media or other types of plugins to improve our customer's online

or plugins.\nGeneral information about how cookies, web beacons, and plugins work can be found above in the sections titled Cookies, Web beacons, and Social Media Plugins, respectively.\nHorizon Hobby has a legitimate interest in providing an optimized user experience from our websites and their advertising.\nThus, the basis for data processing under the GDPR is Art.\n6(1)(f).\nInformation about each of the analytics and advertising services used on Horizon Hobby websites can be found under the Learn More section of this provision.</p>\nLearn More Analytics and Advertising Services\n\u00d7 Google Analytics <p>Some Horizon Hobby websites may use Google Analytics, a web analytics service.\nIt is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>\n<p>Google Analytics uses cookies.\nThese are text files that are stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of your use of the website.\nThe information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p>\n<p>Google Analytics cookies are stored based on GDPR Art.\n6(1)(f).\nThe website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p> IP anonymization <p>We have activated the IP anonymization feature on this website.\nYour IP address will be shortened by Google within the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area prior to transmission to the United States.\nOnly in exceptional cases is the full IP address sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there.\nGoogle will use this information on behalf of the operator of this website to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide other services regarding website activity and Internet usage for the website operator.\nThe IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with any other data held by Google.</p> Browser plugin <p>You can prevent these cookies being stored by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser.\nHowever, we

privacy policy: www.support.google.com/analytics/.</p> Outsourced data processing <p>We have entered into an agreement with Google for the outsourcing of our data processing and fully implement the strict requirements of the German data protection authorities when using Google Analytics.</p> Demographic data collection by Google Analytics <p>This website uses Google Analytics' demographic features.\nThis allows reports to be generated containing statements about the age, gender, and interests of site visitors.\nThis data comes from interest-based advertising from Google and third-party visitor data.\nThis collected data cannot be attributed to any specific individual person.\nYou can disable this feature at any time by adjusting the ads settings in your Google account or you can forbid the collection of your data by Google Analytics as described in the section \"Refusal of data collection.\"</p> Google Analytics Remarketing <p>Some Horizon Hobby websites may use the features of Google Analytics Remarketing to combine with the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and DoubleClick.\nThis service is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>\n<p>This feature makes it possible to link target audiences for promotional marketing created with Google Analytics Remarketing to the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick.\nThis allows advertising to be displayed based on your personal interests, based on your previous usage and surfing behavior on one device (e.g.\nyour mobile phone), and based on your usage on other devices (such as a tablet or computer).</p>\n<p>Once you have given your consent, Google will associate your web and app browsing history with your Google Account for this purpose.\nThat way, any device that signs in to your Google Account can use the same personalized promotional messaging.</p>\n<p>To support this feature, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated IDs of users that are temporarily linked to our Google Analytics data to define and create audiences for cross-device ad promotion.</p>\n<p>You can permanently opt out of cross-device remarketing/targeting by turning off personalized advertising in your Google Account.\nfollow this link: www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/.</p>\n<p>The aggregation of the data collected in your Google Account data is based solely on your consent, which you may give or withdraw from Google under GDPR Art.\n6(1)(a).\nFor data collection operations not merged into your Google Account (for example, because you do not have a Google Account or have objected to the merge), the collection of data is based on GDPR Art.\n6(1)(f).\nHorizon Hobby has a legitimate interest in analyzing anonymous user behavior for promotional purposes.</p>\n<p>For more information and the Google Privacy Policy, go to: www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/.</p> Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking <p>Some Horizon Hobby websites may use Google AdWords.\nAdWords is an online advertising program from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States (\"Google\").</p>\n<p>As part of Google AdWords, we use so-called conversion tracking.\nWhen you click on an ad served by Google, a conversion tracking cookie is set.\nCookies are small text files that your internet browser stores on your computer.\nThese cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification of the user.\nShould the user visit certain pages of the website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the website can tell that the user clicked on the ad and proceeded to that page.</p>\n<p>Each Google AdWords advertiser has a different cookie.\nThus, cookies cannot be tracked using the website of an AdWords advertiser.\nThe information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for the AdWords advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking.\nCustomers are told the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page.\nHowever, advertisers do not obtain any information that can be used to personally identify users.\nIf you do not want to participate in tracking, you can opt-out of this by disabling the Google Conversion Tracking cookie in your browser settings.\nBy doing so, you will not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.</p>\n<p>Conversion cookies are stored based on GDPR Art.\n6(1)(f).\nThe website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p>\n<p>For more information about Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking, see the Google Privacy Policy: www.google.com/policies/privacy/.</p>\n<p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie.\nAlternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your

1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (\"Google\").</p>\n<p>reCAPTCHA is used to check whether the data entered on our website (such as on a contact form) has been entered by a human or by an automated program.\nTo do this, reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of the website visitor based on various characteristics.\nThis analysis starts automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the website.\nFor the analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various information (e.g.\nIP address, how long the visitor has been on the website, or mouse movements made by the user).\nThe data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to Google.</p>\n<p>The reCAPTCHA analyses take place completely in the background.\nWebsite visitors are not advised that such an analysis is taking place.</p>\n<p>Data processing is based on GDPR Art.\n6(1)(f).\nThe website operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its site from abusive automated crawling and spam.</p>\n<p>For more

of Facebook advertisements for statistical and market research purposes and their future optimization.</p>\n<p>The data collected is anonymous to us as operators of this website and we cannot use it to draw any conclusions about our users' identities.\nHowever, the data are stored and processed by Facebook, which may make a connection to your Facebook profile and which may use the data for its own advertising purposes, as stipulated in the Facebook privacy policy.\nThis will allow Facebook to display ads both on Facebook and on third-party sites.\nWe have no control over how this data is used.<br>\nConversion web beacons are used based on GDPR Art.\n6(1)(f).\nThe website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p>\n<p>Check out Facebook's privacy policy to learn more about protecting your privacy: www.facebook.com/about/privacy/.</p>\n<p>You can also deactivate the custom audiences remarketing feature in the Ads Settings section at www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/.\nYou will first need to log into Facebook.</p>\n<p>If you do not have a Facebook account, you can opt out of usage-based advertising from Facebook on the website of the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance: www.youronlinechoices.com.</p> BazaarVoice Web Beacon <p>Some Horizon Hobby webpages may measure conversions using visitor action web beacons from BazaarVoice, which is located at BazaarVoice, Inc., 10901 Stonelake Blvd., Austin, TX 78759, USA (\"BazaarVoice\").</p>\n<p>The data collected is anonymous to us as operators of this website and we cannot use it to draw any conclusions about our users' identities.\nHowever, the data are stored and processed by BazaarVoice, which may make a

interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p>\n<p>You can also opt out of data use by BazaarVoice by visiting their privacy policy webpage and selecting the \"Opt Out\" button in the Opting Out section.</p>\n<p>If located in the European Union, you can also opt out of usage-based advertising from BazaarVoice on the website of the European Interactive

opened and which links you click on.\nWe can thus find out how often various links are clicked.</p>\n<p>In addition, we can see if certain actions take place after clicking on said links (conversion rate).\nWe can thus determine whether the clicking of a link in a newsletter has led to a purchase, for example.</p>\n<p>Our newsletter system also allows us to classify newsletter recipients into different categories (clustering).\nFor example, newsletter recipients can be subdivided according to gender, personal preference (e.g.\nRC planes or RC cars), or customer relationship (e.g.\nexisting or potential customer).\nThis allows us to adapt the newsletters to the respective target groups.</p>\n<p>Data processing is based on GDPR Art.\n6 (1)(a).\nYou may revoke your consent at any time.\nThe data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>\n<p>The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used to distribute the newsletter until
