INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nYOU FURTHER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Generally</strong>.\nArbitration is a method of resolving a Claim without filing a lawsuit.\n\u201cClaim\u201d means any dispute between you, Laravel, and/or any involved third party relating to your account, Your use, your relationship with Laravel, or these Terms of Use.\nThis includes any and all claims that relate in any way to Your use of the products, your attempted use of the products, and any act or omission by Laravel or any third party related to Your use or attempted use of the products.\nYou, Laravel, or any involved third party may pursue a Claim.\nLaravel agrees to binding arbitration should it have any Claims against you.\nLikewise, you agree to binding arbitration should you have any Claims against Laravel.\nBy agreeing to arbitrate, you waive the right to go to court and agree instead to submit any Claims to binding arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to binding arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (the \u201cFAA\u201d), 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1-16, as amended.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Exceptions to Binding Arbitration</strong>.\nAs an exception to binding arbitration, you and Laravel both retain the right to pursue, in a small claims court, any claim that is within that court\u2019s jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual (non-class) basis.\nLaravel will not demand arbitration in connection with any individual claim that you properly file and pursue in a small claims court, so long as the claim is pending only in that court.\nBinding arbitration also does not apply to disputes concerning trade secret misappropriation, patent infringement, copyright infringement or misuse, or trademark infringement or dilution.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Mandatory Pre-Dispute Procedures</strong>.\nYou acknowledge and agree that before initiating any Claim (subject to the exceptions above) against Laravel, you will first give us an opportunity to resolve your problem or dispute.\nThis includes sending a written description of your problem or dispute to us, including, but not limited to, information or representations related to our products and upon which you rely.\nYou may send the written description by U.S.\nMail to Laravel, Attn: Legal, Green, LLC, 954 Ponce de Leon, #203-A, San Juan, PR 00907.\nYou agree to negotiate with Laravel in good faith about your problem or dispute.\nIf for some reason your problem or dispute is not resolved to your satisfaction within 60 days after Laravel\u2019 receipt of your written dispute, you agree to the dispute resolution provisions below.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Commencement of Arbitration</strong>.\nYou and Laravel agree to commence any arbitration proceeding within 1 year after the Claim arises (including the mandatory pre-dispute procedures outlined above) and that any proceeding commenced after 1 year shall be barred.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Location</strong>.\nFor your convenience, the arbitration may be conducted in the federal district where you reside.\nIt may be held by telephone or through written submissions if both you and Laravel agree.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sponsoring Organization, Rules and the Arbitrator</strong>.\nYou agree that any Claims shall be resolved by submitting the dispute to final and binding confidential arbitration before a single arbitrator who is a retired judge or an experienced attorney with experience in the subject(s) of the Claim.\nThe arbitrator shall be chosen from JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and the arbitration rules of the selected tribunal shall apply, which can be obtained by calling the selected tribunal.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms of Use and this arbitration provision.\nThe arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you or Laravel.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Fees</strong>.\nLaravel shall pay for all filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees for an arbitration initiated by either party.\nThe parties shall each pay their own additional fees, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and witnesses.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Award</strong>.\nThe arbitrator shall follow substantive law and may order any relief if permitted by law.\nThe arbitrator may award any form of individual relief, including injunctions and punitive damages, so long as they are in accordance with applicable law.\nThe arbitrator may award costs or fees to a prevailing party, but only if the law expressly allows it.\nAlthough Laravel may have a right to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses under some laws if it prevails, Laravel agrees that it will not seek such an award, unless your Claims are determined by the arbitrator to be frivolous.\nNothing herein shall be construed to limit the arbitrator\u2019s ability to award remedies provided by applicable law.\nAny award rendered shall include a written opinion and shall be final, subject to appeal under the FAA.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Enforceability</strong>.\nThis provision survives termination of your account or relationship with Laravel, bankruptcy, assignment or transfer.\nIf the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable (i.e., unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or representative action), then this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply.\nIf a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Miscellaneous</strong>.\nFailure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any Claims will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other Claims.\nThis provision is the entire arbitration agreement between you and Laravel and shall not be modified except in writing by Laravel.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Amendments</strong>.\nLaravel reserves the right to amend this arbitration provision at any time.\nYour continued use of any Laravel Website, purchase of a Laravel product, or use or attempted use of a Laravel product, is affirmation of your consent to such changes.\nShould the changes to this arbitration provision be material, Laravel will provide you notice and an opportunity to opt-out.\nYour continued use of any Laravel Website, purchase of a Laravel product, or use or attempted use of a Laravel product, is affirmation of your consent to such material changes.</p>\n<p>YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE YOU FIRST ACCESS THE WEBSITE BY WRITING TO Laravel, ATTN: LEGAL, GREEN, LLC, 954 PONCE DE LEON, #203-A, SAN JUAN, PR 00907.\nFOR YOUR OPT-OUT TO BE EFFECTIVE, YOU MUST SUBMIT A SIGNED WRITTEN NOTICE IDENTIFYING ANY Laravel YOU ENTERED WITHIN THE 30 DAYS AND THE DATE YOU FIRST ENTERED OT ATTEMPTED TO ENTER.\nUNTIMELY OPT-OUTS WILL NOT BE VALID AND YOU MUST THEN PURSUE YOUR CLAIM THROUGH ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THESE TERMS.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.\nTermination of Website </strong>\n</p>\n<p>You agree that Laravel may, in its sole discretion, and at any time, terminate or suspend its operation of the Website or Your use of the Website, without prior notice to you, for any reason that Laravel, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.\nYou further agree that Laravel will not be liable to you or to any third party for the consequences of such termination or suspension.\nIn the event of any termination of Your use of or access to the Website, you agree that the provisions of the Agreement regarding protection of Intellectual Property Rights and license, indemnification, disclaimer regarding information provided on the website, disclaimer of warranties with respect to use of the website, limitation on Laravel\u2019 liability, and pre-dispute, mandatory binding arbitration, and class action waiver shall survive any such termination.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.\nExclusive Venue for Other Controversies </strong>\n</p>\n<p>You agree that any controversy excluded from the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions in this Agreement (other than an individual action filed in small claims court) shall be filed only in the Supreme Court of New York County, New York, or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for any such controversy.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.\nRemedies for Laravel </strong>\n</p>\n<p>In order to avoid irreparable injury to Laravel, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by you of the provisions of this Agreement, we shall be entitled to seek an injunction and/or other equitable relief restraining such breach.\nNothing in this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting Laravel from pursuing any other remedies available to it for such breach or threatened breach, including the recovery of monetary damages from you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.\nModifications to the Agreement </strong>\n</p>\n<p>Laravel may make changes to these Terms of Use, from time to time, in its sole discretion, by updating this posting on the Website without notice to you.\nYour continued use of the Website following the posting of a new version of the Terms of Use constitutes your acceptance of any such changes.\nAccordingly, whenever
