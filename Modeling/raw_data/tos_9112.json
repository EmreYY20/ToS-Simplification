07004.</p>\n<p> B.\nFORMAL RESOLUTION BY ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER:</p>\n<p>READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY, IT LIMITS YOUR RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION.\nIf you and BulbHead cannot resolve a Claim informally, any Claim asserted by either you or BulbHead will be resolved only by binding Arbitration subject to the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>\n<p>By agreeing to Arbitration, you are waiving your rights to maintain other available resolution processes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle disputes.\nInstead of suing in court, both you and BulbHead agree to settle disputes only by Arbitration.\nARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.\nThe rules in Arbitration are different.\nThere is no judge or jury, and review is limited, but an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief, and must honor the same limitations stated in these Terms and Conditions as a court would.</p>\n<p>The Arbitration will be conducted under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp.\nProcedures (referred to as the \u201cJAMS Rules\u201d) and under the rules set forth in these Terms and Conditions.\nIf there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms and Conditions, the rules set forth in these Terms and Conditions will govern.\nYou may, in Arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to the law of the governing state.\nIf you decide to initiate Arbitration, BulbHead agrees to pay the Arbitration initiation fee and any additional required deposit required by JAMS to initiate your Arbitration.\nYou and BulbHead agree to pay the costs of the Arbitration proceeding provided however that if you are a consumer you shall not be required to pay more than $250.00 of the fees or such amount as the JAMS Rules may later prescribe.\nAll other fees, such as attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses of travel to the Arbitration, will be paid in accordance with JAMS Rules.\nThe Arbitration will be held at a location in your home town area if possible, unless you and BulbHead both agree to another location or telephonic Arbitration.\nTo initiate Arbitration, you or BulbHead must do the following things:</p>\n<p> (1) Write a demand for Arbitration.\nThe demand must include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered.</p>\n<p> You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com.</p>\n<p> (2) Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to: </p>\n<p> JAMS [to your local JAMS office or to JAMS, 620 Eighth Ave., 34th Floor, New York, NY 10018].</p>\n<p> (3) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the last known physical address of the other party.</p>\n<p>Special Rules in the Arbitration Proceeding.\n(i) The arbitrator has no authority to make errors of law and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator does so.\nOtherwise, the arbitrator\u2019s decision is final and binding on all parties and may be enforced in any Federal or State court that has jurisdiction.\n(ii) Neither you nor BulbHead shall be entitled to join or consolidate claims in Arbitration by or against other individuals or entities, or arbitrate any claim as a representative member of a class or in a private attorney general capacity.\nTHIS MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO INITIATE OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION WHATSOEVER.\nAccordingly, you and BulbHead agree that the JAMS Class Action Procedures do not apply to our Arbitration.</p>\n<p>A court may sever any portion of this dispute resolution provision if it finds such unenforceable, except for the prohibition on class, representative and private attorney general arbitrations.\nNotwithstanding the obligation to arbitrate all Claims under these Terms and Conditions, you may assert an individual Claim in small claims court in lieu of Arbitration.</p>\n<p>20.\nLimited Time to File Claims <br>You must assert any Claim relating to use of this Site or the purchase of any products from BulbHead within one (1) year after the Claim

IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS ON THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION 21.</p>\n<p>22.\nSeverability\n<br>In the event that a provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful or otherwise unenforceable, the Agreement will remain in force as though it had been entered into without that unenforceable provision being included in it.</p>\n<p>23.\nNon-Waiver\n<br>BulbHead reserves all rights under this Agreement as well as under the provisions of any applicable law.\nOur non-enforcement of any particular provision or provisions of this Agreement or any applicable law should not be construed as our waiver of the right to enforce that same provision under the same or different circumstances at any time in the future.</p>\n<p>24.\nTermination &amp.\nCancellation\n<br>We may terminate your access to our Site and Service at our discretion without explanation, though we will strive to provide a timely explanation in most cases.\nOur liability for refunding you, if you have paid anything to us, will be limited to the amount you paid for goods or services which have not yet been and will not be delivered, except in cases where the termination or cancellation was due to your breach of this Agreement, in which case we are not required to provide any refund or other compensation whatsoever.</p>\n<p>Under no circumstances, including termination or cancellation of our Service to you, will we be liable for any losses related to actions of other Users.</p>\n<p>SEE SECTION 27 BELOW FOR IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS ON THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION 24.</p>\n<p>25.\nAssignment of Rights\n<br>You may not assign your rights and/or obligations under this Agreement to any other party without our prior written consent.\nWe may assign our rights and/or obligations under this Agreement to any other party at our discretion.</p>\n<p>26.\nAmendments\n<br>We reserve the right to amend these Terms and Conditions from time to time by posting updated Terms and Conditions and/or an updated Privacy Policy on the Site.\nYour continued use of our Service shall constitute your acceptance of any such amendments.</p>\n<p>27.\nEXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS.\nCONSUMER PROTECTION NOTICE\n<br>Nothing in this Section shall modify Subsection 20(B) (\u201cFormal Resolution by Arbitration/Class Action Waiver\u201d).</p>\n<p>For Jurisdictions that do not allow us to limit our liability: If you are a consumer, the provisions in these Terms and Conditions are intended to be only as broad and inclusive as is permitted by the laws of your State of residence.\nNotwithstanding any provision of these Terms, if your jurisdiction has provisions specific to waiver or liability that conflict with the above then our liability is limited to the smallest extent possible by law.\nSpecifically, in those jurisdictions not allowed, we do not disclaim liability for: (a) death or personal injury caused by our negligence or that of any of our officers, employees or agents.\nor (b) fraudulent misrepresentation.\nor (c) any liability which it is not lawful to exclude either now or in the future.</p>\n<p>IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION THAT REQUIRES A SPECIFIC STATEMENT REGARDING RELEASE THEN THE FOLLOWING
