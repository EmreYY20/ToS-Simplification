as well as ourselves.\nIf we detect any kind of activity that breaks any of these terms, you will be permanently banned.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Banned TrafficThe appKarma Android app may not be used in the following countries: Vietnam, Morocco, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, UAE, Yemen, Saudi Arabia<p>\n</p>\n<p>Traffic from certain countries are no longer allowed on the appKarma system.\nIf we detect traffic sources from the above stated countries, the system will automatically block and/or suspend the account from further activities.\nWe reserve the right to add countries on our blacklist as we continue to analyze any fraudulent activities.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Karma PointsKarma Points is a virtual currency that has no real world value.\nYou can earn Karma Points in exchange for rewards within the appKarma app (rewards and their exchange rates are determined by the Company).\nShould your account be suspended, deleted, or should appKarma cease operations, you agree that you will forfeit all KARMA POINTS in your account.\nReward issuance is not guaranteed even if offer requirements are made<p>\n</p>\n<p>Karma Points aren't real.\nYou can't ask us to give you real money in exchange for cold hard cash.\nYou will not have access to your Karma Points if we restrict access to your account or delete your account.\nIf appKarma shuts down, you will not be compensated or have any access to the Karma Points in your account.\nWe cannot guarantee that you will receive rewards even if you complete the offer requirements stated.</p>\n<p>\n</p>PrivacyAny information you provide to appKarma is subject to appKarma's Privacy Policy, which governs our collection and use of your information.\nYou understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information.<p>\n</p>\n<p>Please check it out.\nWe collect information primarly to identify that you are really you, not someone who is trying to impersonate you or some robot or virtual being.\nSince this is a rewards app, it's important we attribute the rewards to the right person so it's fair to all users, to us, and to the advertisers.\nIf we don't do this, we will be out of business really quickly.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Limitation on Account Creation and Account Sign In.Only one appKarma account can be associated per device.<p>\n</p>\n<p>(1) If you create an appKarma account on a device, then that is the only account you can use for that device.</p>\n<p>(2) If you sign-in to a new device, then that account you signed in with is the only account that can be used with that device.</p>\n<p>(3) You are limited to a number of devices you can sign into within a certain time period.</p>\n<p>Because of the security and reward tracking implementation we have in place, we can only allow a single account to be created per device.\nThere really isn't any reason for anyone to have multiple accounts (it's like someone applying to two frequent flier accounts from the same airline).\nIf you are sharing a device with another user, we're sorry, you'll have to buy another device to register your account on.\nThe only time this clause can become an issue is if you obtain a device from another person who has already registered an account on your device.\nIf this is the case you can email us, but we reserve the right to decide whether an account can be created.\nAdditionally, we realize people have multiple devices (tablet, phone) and that people change devices all the time and may want to use our app on different device.\nWe allow a reasonable number sign-ins within a fixed time period.</p>\n<p>\n</p>PasswordsYou are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Services and for any activities or actions under your password.\nWe encourage you to use \"strong\" passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account.\nappKarma cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above.<p>\n</p>\n<p>Tip: \"abcd\", \"1234\", are not strong passwords, \"iHeArTmil3yCyRU5\" is a strong password.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Deleting AccountYou have the right to delete your account anytime you want.\nTo delete your account, please send us an email to support@appkarma.io specifying that you want to delete your account.\nWe will contact you to confirm your request, and your account will be deleted within a few days.<p>\n</p>\n<p>Not everyone will like us.\nLet us know and we'll close out your account.\nThanks for trying us out and we'll really appreciate it if you can tell us where we need to improve.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Intellectual PropertyAll Services and its original content, features and functionality are owned by Darkfield Software LLC and are protected by international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws.<p>\n</p>\n<p>Everything we create is ours.\nPlease don't steal.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Account Suspension and TerminationAppKarma may terminate or suspend your access to or ability to use any and all Services immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason or no reason, including but not limited to if you breach any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement.\nIn particular, appKarma may immediately terminate or suspend Accounts that have been flagged for suspected fraudulent activities.<p>\n</p>\n<p>Upon termination of your access to or ability to use a Service, including but not limited to suspension of your Account on a Service, your right to use or access that Service and any information associated with you will immediately cease and may result in forfeiture and destruction.\nAll provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.\nTermination of your access to and use of the Services shall not relieve you of any obligations arising or accruing prior to such termination or limit any liability which you otherwise may have to appKarma or any third party.</p>\n<p>If you attempt or engage in any fraudulent activities or break any of the terms as outlined in this page, your account will be suspended and you will lose everything associated with your account.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Links To Other SitesThe Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources.\nYou acknowledge and agree that the appKarma is not responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such websites or resources.\nor (ii) the content, products, or services on or available from such websites or resources.\nLinks to such websites or resources do not imply any endorsement by appKarma of such websites or resources or the content, products, or services available from such websites or resources.\nYou acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of any such websites or resources.<p>\n</p>\n<p>We aren't responsible for stuff that other people write or create on their sites</p>\n<p>\n</p>Gift Card DisclaimersWe do not issue refunds on gift card rewards redeemed with Karma Points virtual currency.\nAlthough we will make every effort to correct any issues (in the form of crediting a Subscriber's account the proper amount of credits) due to invalid, inactive, or otherwise unusable gift cards, we reserve the right to determine on a case by case basis which accounts are eligible for the correction.\nGift card companies are not affiliated with or are sponsors of appKarma.<p>\n</p>\n<p>We can't issue refunds for gift cards because there is no way for us to know whether a gift card has been used.\nThe only exception we make is if there is an issue with the gift card number, which in rare cases do happen.\nIn such instances, it does require some time to investigate and we reserve the right to decide whether you are eligible for a refund.\nNone of the companies that we have gift cards for are sponsors of appKarma.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Disclaimer of WarrantiesYour access to and use of the Services or any Content is at your own risk.\nYOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" BASIS.\nWITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, APPKARMA DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A

create any warranty not expressly made herein.\nAdditionally, while we work to protect the security of your content and account, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security measures.<p>\n</p>\n<p>You agree that we are not responsible for the loss of your Karma Points virtual currency, other points, credits, achievements, rewards, gift cards, regardless of monetary value, in the event there is any data or server error, computer and/or network system error or failure, criminal act, vandalism, or cyber attack.</p>\n<p>We're not perfect.\nSometimes bad things happen.\nAlthough we try to do everything to prevent bad things from happening, there are times when it's beyond our control or ability.\nWith regards to reward issuance, we work with partners to provide offers for users to complete to earn rewards and issue rewards based on these partner's system notifying us.\nThere isn't much we can do if our partner fails to signal us when you've completed your task resulting in you not receiving your reward.\nFurthermore, app developers and ad networks often have measures in place to prevent users who have already completed an offer (or have installed an app or watched a video) from getting credited more than once.\nPlease accept that we may not be able to fix everything and make everyone happy should these bad things happen.</p>\n<p>\n</p>IndemnificationYou agree to indemnify and hold the Company, and each of its directors, managers, officers, agents, contractors, partners and employees, harmless from and against any loss, liability, claim, action, cause of action, application, demand, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, arising out of or in connection with (i) your use
