Section (Dispute Resolution, Arbitration, and Class Action Waiver), \u201cRBI\u201d shall include its subsidiaries, affiliates, and their respective shareholders, directors, officers, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns.\nExcept where prohibited by applicable law, which may include the Province of Quebec (to the extent applicable), the following terms apply to all legal disputes between you and RBI.Most issues can be resolved quickly and amicably by contacting Firehouse Subs customer support at guestservices@firehousesubs.com.&nbsp;We understand, however, that sometimes disputes cannot be easily resolved by customer support.\nThis section explains how you and RBI agree to resolve those disputes, including (where applicable) through binding, individual arbitration.\nArbitration is an alternative dispute resolution procedure that allows us to resolve issues without going to court.\nAny dispute between you and RBI is submitted to a neutral arbitrator (not a judge or jury) for fair and fast resolution.\nThe right to appeal from an arbitrator\u2019s decision is very limited.You and RBI agree to arbitrate all \u201cDisputes\u201d between us arising out of or relating to the Services or to these Terms (including without limitation the Privacy Policy), regardless of whether the Dispute is based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory.\n\u201cDispute\u201d means any claim or controversy between you and RBI, including claims that arose before this or any prior agreement or that arise after the termination of the Terms, and will be given the broadest possible meaning permitted by law.\nAny question about whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration, including any Dispute about the interpretation, applicability, meaning or enforceability of any provision of the Terms (except for whether or not the agreement to arbitrate was validly formed) will be decided by the arbitrator, not a court.\nThis requirement for binding individual arbitration survives any termination of the Terms or the cessation of RBI\u2019s provision of services to you.Only the following Disputes are exempt from the arbitration requirement: (1) complaints you wish to make to a government agency.\n(2) small claims court actions (as discussed below).\n(3) claims related to intellectual property infringement.\n(4) claims related to the enforceability of the requirement that arbitrations must be conducted on an individual basis only.\nand (5) actions to compel arbitration or to uphold or enforce any prior arbitration decision.\nFurther, you or RBI may seek an injunction in court on an individual (non-class) basis to preserve the status quo between us for the entire period until we resolve the Dispute in arbitration.If you have an issue that our customer support cannot resolve, or if RBI has a claim against you, before you, or we, can commence an arbitration, we first agree to make a good-faith effort to negotiate a resolution.\nThose informal negotiations will start on the day that you or RBI sends a written Notice of Dispute as set forth in this section, and you and RBI agree not to start an arbitration until we have engaged in at least sixty (60) days of informal negotiations.\nThis is called the \u201cInformal Resolution Period.\n\u201dThe Notice of Dispute must include your name and contact information (address, telephone number, and email address), and a detailed description of (1) the Dispute, (2) the nature and basis of your claims, and (3) the nature and basis of the relief sought, with a detailed calculation.\nThe Notice shall be sent by mail to: Restaurant Brands International US Services LLC, Attn: Legal (DMCA Copyright Infringement), 5707 Blue Lagoon Drive, Miami, Florida 33126.\nYou must personally sign the Notice.\nIf requested by RBI, you must personally appear at and participate in a telephone settlement conference (if you are represented by counsel, your counsel may also participate) to discuss the Dispute.\nIf the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Notice (which period can be extended by written agreement of the parties), you or RBI may commence a formal demand for arbitration.\nCompliance with and completing this informal dispute resolution process is a condition precedent to filing any formal demand for arbitration.\nThe statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process.As an alternative, if you are seeking only monetary damages for your personal Dispute with RBI and not seeking relief on behalf of any other person, and if your claim fails within the jurisdiction of the small claims court in the county where you reside, you may bring your Dispute in that small claims court.\nWe hope you will try the informal resolution process described herein first and send a Notice of Dispute to start that process, but you do not have to go through such process before going to small claims court.TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND RBI AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT.\nAny Dispute brought in small claims court must remain in such court and may not be removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction and may advance only on an individual (non-class, non-representative basis).If you and RBI do not resolve any Dispute by informal negotiation, any other effort to resolve the Dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration as described in this section.\nBY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE (OR PARTICIPATE IN AS A PARTY OR CLASS MEMBER) ANY DISPUTES WITH RBI IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.\nInstead, all disputes will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration by a single American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) arbitrator, according to the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (the \u201cAAA Rules\u201d), effective as of the date you send a Notice of Dispute.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nThe arbitration will be subject to and governed by the FAA and other federal arbitration law.\nYou and RBI both agree that the arbitration will be conducted in the English language and that the arbitrator will be bound by the Terms.\nAlthough RBI may revise the Terms in its discretion, including the way in which Disputes are resolved, RBI does not have the right to alter this agreement to arbitrate or the rules specified herein with respect to any Dispute with respect to which a Notice of Dispute already has been sent.You or RBI may commence an arbitration only after the conclusion of the Informal Resolution Period.\nIf either you or RBI commences an arbitration without having previously provided a valid and compliant Notice of Dispute, you and RBI agree that the AAA (or the arbitrator, if one has been appointed) must (i) suspend the arbitration until the party that initiated it complies with this requirement, and (ii) order the party that commenced the arbitration without having complied with this requirement to reimburse any arbitration fees paid by the other party prior to the suspension.\nYou and RBI authorize the AAA or the arbitrator to decide summarily whether the party that commenced an arbitration complied with pre-filing requirements, relying solely on the Terms and the Notice of Dispute (if any) that the claimant provided before commencing arbitration.RBI DOES NOT CONSENT TO HAVING ANY DISPUTE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS BASIS, EVEN TO THE EXTENT THE ARBITRATION PROVIDER\u2019S RULES MAY ALLOW FOR IT.\nAny arbitration will be conducted on an individual basis only.\nTo the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, you and RBI agree only to bring Disputes in an individual capacity and shall not seek to bring, join, or participate in any class or representative action, collective or class-wide arbitration, or any other action where one person or entity acts in a representative capacity (e.g., private attorney general actions), and the arbitrator may not issue relief to any person who is not a claimant in arbitration.To start an arbitration, if you have already complied with the Informal Resolution Period requirements, you should follow the instructions on the AAA website.\nYou also may call AAA at 800-778-7879.The party starting an arbitration must send AAA a \u201cDemand for Arbitration,\u201d pay a filing fee, and mail a copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the opposing party.\nIf you commence an arbitration, you must send a copy sent by mail to: Restaurant Brands International US Services LLC, Attn: Legal (DMCA Copyright Infringement), 5707 Blue Lagoon Drive, Miami, Florida 33126.If RBI commences the arbitration, RBI must send your copy to your registered email address and to the current mailing or billing address(es) you have provided us (if any).If you are or RBI is demanding recovery of $10,000 or less, the arbitrator may resolve the Dispute based upon the parties\u2019 written submissions alone, without a live hearing, unless the arbitrator believes a hearing is required.\nFor matters where the arbitrator believes a hearing is required, or for Disputes involving more than $10,000 but less than $25,000 in controversy, hearings will be conducted by teleconference or video conference, unless the arbitrator believes an in-person hearing is necessary.\nIn such instances, or for Disputes with $25,000 or more in controversy, the location of an arbitration hearing will be decided pursuant to the AAA Rules.An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court, in favor or against only the parties to the arbitration and only to the extent necessary to provide the relief warranted by the party\u2019s individual claim, including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages.\nThe arbitrator may not award relief to any person or entity other than a party to the arbitration proceeding.\nThe arbitrator must follow these Terms as a court would.\nThe arbitrator may not consider any prior settlement offers in making the decision.\nThe arbitrator shall issue a reasoned, written decision sufficient to explain the arbitrator\u2019s essential findings and conclusions.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision will be final and binding, except for the limited judicial review provided by the FAA, and may be enforced as a final judgment by any court of competent jurisdiction.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision shall have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or other proceeding involving a different party, provided that the arbitrator may consider rulings in other arbitrations involving different individuals.\nIf either party unsuccessfully challenges the validity or enforcement of an award, the unsuccessful party shall pay the opposing party\u2019s costs and attorneys\u2019 fees associated with the unsuccessful challenge.If any provision of this section is found invalid or unenforceable, You and RBI agree that the provision will be severed and the rest of the Terms shall remain in effect and be construed as if any severed provision had not been included.\nThe sole exception is that if the preclusion on class arbitration is found invalid or unenforceable, this entire section will be void and any affected Dispute will be resolved in court.\nIn the event a dispute cannot, by applicable law, be subject to binding arbitration, you and RBI irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the state and/or federal courts in the Southern District of Florida, except where prohibited by applicable law, which may include the Province of Quebec.\nNothing in this paragraph shall preclude either you or RBI from removing to federal court a case filed in state court, if federal jurisdiction exists.In a dispute between a consumer and a business, no matter which side starts the arbitration process, the AAA Rules require the business to pay most of the filing and hearing fees for the arbitration, but also require the consumer to pay a filing fee.\nRBI will pay all fees and costs that we are required by law to pay.\nThe parties shall be responsible for their own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration, unless they are authorized by law or the arbitrator determines that a claim was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or in bad faith.IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.\nIf a court determines that any of the prohibitions on non-individualized relief.\nclass, representative, and private attorney general claims.\nand consolidation are unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief), and all appeals from that decision have been exhausted (or the decision is otherwise final), then the parties agree that that particular claim or request for relief may proceed in court but shall be stayed pending arbitration of the remaining claims.\nSpecifically, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, the arbitrator may not issue a \u201cpublic injunction\u201d and any such \u201cpublic injunction,\u201d if permitted, may be awarded only by a federal or state court.\nIf either party is permitted to seek a \u201cpublic injunction,\u201d all other claims and prayers for relief must be adjudicated in arbitration first and any such prayer or claim for a \u201cpublic injunction\u201d in federal or state court stayed until the arbitration is completed, after which the federal or state court can adjudicate the party\u2019s claim or prayer for \u201cpublic injunctive relief.\u201d In doing so, the federal or state court is bound under principles of claim or issue preclusion by the decision of the arbitrator.Special Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration: If twenty-five (25) or more similar claims are asserted against RBI by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated, you understand and agree that the resolution of your Dispute might be delayed.\nYou also agree to the following coordinated bellwether process and application of the AAA Multiple Consumer Case Filing Fee Schedule.\nCounsel for the claimants and counsel for RBI shall each select ten (10) cases (per side) to proceed first in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a bellwether process, which shall be completed within 180 days from the selection of cases.\nThe remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any AAA fees be assessed in connection with those cases until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a bellwether process.\nIf the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the initial twenty (20) proceedings, each side shall select another ten (10) cases (per side) to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a second bellwether process, which shall be completed within 180 days from the selection of cases.\nThe remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any AAA fees be assessed in connection with those cases until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a bellwether process.\nA single arbitrator shall preside over each case.\nOnly one case may be assigned to each arbitrator as part of a bellwether process unless the parties agree otherwise.\nThis staged process shall continue,

any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled for claims subject to this section from the time the first cases are selected for a bellwether process until the time your case is selected for a bellwether process, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved.\nA court shall have authority to enforce this paragraph and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing or prosecution of arbitration demands against RBI.To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, regardless of whether a Dispute must be arbitrated or is exempt from the arbitration requirement, you or RBI must provide a Notice of Dispute\u2014or, for exempt Disputes, commence litigation\u2014within three (3) years from when the claimant first knew or reasonably should have known that the Dispute existed.\nIf applicable law provides a shorter
