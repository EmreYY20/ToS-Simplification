liable, and you shall not seek to hold Nextdoor liable, for any damages related to your use of the text notification service.\nIf you use certain additional Services, you may receive additional

our lawful business purposes, including to analyze and improve our Services and promote Nextdoor.</p>\n<br>\n<u>3.\nHow Is My Personal Information Shared with Others?</u>\n<p>We share personal

other.\nTo that end, the Content you post on Nextdoor, such as posts, replies, recommendations, messages, and your profile information, may be visible to other Members, businesses, governments and agencies, or the public, including Visitors (people who have not registered for our Services but may still access parts of our Services, as defined in the Member Agreement) and search engines and this Content may include personal information.\nYou can adjust the visibility of your posts in the preferences in your settings, the preferences on the Content you provide, and as described in Section 5

advertising to those Members or to similar audiences.\nOur advertising partners may be able to associate this information with you based on your advertising identifiers or other personal information

measure the effectiveness of the ads.</p>\n<br>3.5 Third party partners.\n<p>Nextdoor may partner with third parties such as Pros though the Hire a Pro Service, which gives Members the ability to book

Hire a Pro Service, or Nextdoor may provide links to other websites or apps featuring the offers.\nIn order to tailor offers for services to you, we may share personal information with these third parties, such as your neighborhood or zip code, the business topic of the content you are viewing, or a business search query (for example, a search for \u201cplumber\u201d).\nWhen you engage with one of these offers or request a booking with a Pro, you or Nextdoor may share additional information (such as contact information) directly with the third party partner or their representative.\nIf you engage with third party partners through Nextdoor, the third parties may share with us certain personal information about you to allow us to monitor, coordinate, assess, and improve our Services provided to you.\nThis may include information about a booking you make with the third party, including type of service, name and address of provider, the time of booking, and your communications with

apps.</p>\n<br>3.6 Service providers.\n<p>We may also share personal information with service providers and/or data processors to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services.\nThese service providers and data processors are contractually obligated to use personal information only to provide their service to us, and are contractually prohibited from using it for their own purposes.\nThey provide a variety of services, including payment processing, information technology, generative artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, fraud prevention, hosting, customer relationship management and support, communications delivery, marketing, advertising, and website and mobile application analytics.</p>\n<br>3.7&nbsp;Social media.\n<p>Our Services include certain social media features, including a social media share button.\nIf you choose to share Content with personal information using this button, information about that Content will be shared

family within which we share personal information by establishing local subsidiaries or other affiliates in these countries as needed to help us provide our Services there.<br>\n<br>For more information about cross-border transfers of personal information, see Section 7 below titled \u201cInternational Transfers of Personal Information\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\n<br>3.9 Business

proceedings).</p>\n<br>3.10 Professional advisors.\n<p>We may share personal information with our professional advisors, such as lawyers, auditors, bankers and insurers, where necessary in the course of the professional services that they render to Nextdoor.</p>\n<br>3.11 Payment processors.\n<p>Any payment card information you use to make a purchase on our Services is collected and processed directly by our payment processors, such as Stripe.\nThe use of any payment information that you choose to share with Stripe is governed by its privacy policy, at

can read more here about the choices you have regarding the sharing and visibility of your posts.\nSome of these choices may not be available for our Business Services, such as our Business Pages.<br>\n<br>You can opt out of third party personalized advertising by adjusting your cookie settings or changing the privacy settings on your mobile device.\nFor more information about third party use of cookies, mobile advertising identifiers, and similar technologies and how to adjust your settings, see our Advertising and Cookie Policy.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>Our systems are not currently configured to accept browsers\u2019 \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signals, as no industry-wide standard for handling them has been adopted.<br>\n<br>See our jurisdiction-specific disclosures in Section 11 below for more information about legal rights you have if you live in a listed jurisdiction.</p>\n<br>\n<u>5.\nHow Long Is My Personal Information Kept?</u>\n<p>We retain personal information in our server logs, our databases, and our records for as long as necessary to provide our Services.\nWe may need to retain some of your information for a longer period, such as in order to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, to resolve disputes or defend against legal claims, or to enforce our Member Agreement.</p>\n<br>\n<u>6.\nInternational Transfers of Personal Information.</u>\n<p>Nextdoor operates internationally, and your personal information may be transferred to and processed on servers outside the jurisdiction where you live.\nWe typically transfer personal information to the United States, which is where Nextdoor is headquartered and where many of our Services are based.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>Depending on where you live, your personal information may be transferred to jurisdictions other than your home country, including the United States, and those other jurisdictions may have different or less protective data protection laws than the jurisdiction where you live.\nIn addition, the rights of authorities to access your personal information in other jurisdictions may not be the same as in your home jurisdiction.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>By continuing to use Nextdoor, you understand and consent to the transfer and processing of your personal information outside your home country, which may have data protection rules that are different or less protective from those of your home country, including the United States.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>Nextdoor will only transfer personal data as permitted by law, and Nextdoor will only process personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWe will take steps designed to ensure appropriate protection of your personal information.\nIf you have questions about international transfers of personal information, please contact us.<br>\n<br>For residents of Europe or countries with aligned data protection laws, additional information is provided in the jurisdiction-specific disclosures required under European data protection laws.&nbsp;</p>\n<br>\n<u>7.\nHow Is My Personal Information Protected?</u>\n<br>7.1 Account security.\n<p>Nextdoor uses technical and organizational measures intended to keep your data secure, including using https on our web pages to reduce the risk of unauthorized interception of your communications during your visits to the website and two-factor authentication where appropriate.\nHowever, the internet is not a fully secure environment and we cannot guarantee that personal information won\u2019t be intercepted or improperly accessed.\nPlease ensure that you keep your password safe and do not share it with anyone.</p>\n<br>7.2 Other services and websites.\n<p>When using Nextdoor, you may come across links to websites and services operated by third parties that are not owned or controlled by Nextdoor (for example, if a Member shares a link to a video on YouTube, or if an advertiser provides a link to a contest or sweepstakes).\nThis Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected on any third party website or application that may link to or be accessible from our Services.\nThese third parties have their own privacy policies, which govern any personal information they collect.\nWe do not accept any responsibility or liability for such external websites\u2019 privacy and security practices.</p>\n<br>\n<u>8.\nPersonal Information Relating to Children.</u>\n<p>Children are not allowed to use our Services if they are under 13 years old or not old enough for Nextdoor to process their personal information without parental or age-specific consent in the place where they live.\nIf you believe we might have collected personal information from a child in one of these categories, please contact us at privacy@nextdoor.com for us to investigate and delete as appropriate.</p>\n<br>\n<u>9.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy.</u>\n<p>We may make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please review it periodically.\nIf we materially change this Privacy Policy, we will take steps to notify you in advance of the change as required by applicable law, for example by emailing you or by posting a notice in your neighborhood feed.\nIf you object to any changes, you may delete your account.\nYou acknowledge that your continued use of our Services after we publish or

"//*[@id=\"articlecontent\"]", "text": "<p>Effective January 1, 2023.<br>\n<br>This policy explains how cookies, mobile advertising identifiers, and similar technologies are used on our website and apps (together, \u201cNextdoor\u201d or our \u201cServices\u201d).</p> 1.\nWhat is a cookie?\nA cookie is a small file containing a unique identifier that is placed in the web browser of your computer or mobile device when you visit a site.\nCookies and similar technologies (which include pixels, tags, web beacons, software development kits (\u201cSDKs\u201d) and local browser storage technologies) (together \u201ccookies\u201d) enable operators of sites/apps to recognize your device and collect information from it when you interact with them.\nThey use this information to understand how the site/app is being used, remember user preferences and improve user browsing experience.\nCookies are also used to make the advertising you see online more relevant to your interests.\n<br>2.\nWhat is a mobile advertising identifier?\nMost major phones and tablets include a mobile advertising identifier (e.g., an IDFA on iOS and an ADID on Android) that is a unique device identifier that enables third parties to connect you to your activities across apps and websites, including Nextdoor.\nThis is generally used for personalizing advertising and measurement of advertising campaigns.\nEven without a mobile advertising identifier, you\u2019d still see advertising but those ads may be less relevant to you.\n<br>3.\nWho places cookies on my device?\nCookies set by the site you visit are called \u201c<em>\n<u>first party cookies</u>\n</em>.\u201d Here, first party cookies are cookies placed by Nextdoor).&nbsp;<br>\n<br>Cookies set by other parties are called \u201c<em>\n<u>third party cookies</u>\n</em>.\u201d Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality within the site, such as site analytics, advertising and social media features.\nThe parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer or device both when it visits the site/app in question and also when it visits certain other sites/apps.\nWe do not control how these third parties use your information, which is subject to their own privacy policies.\nSee the table below for details of the use of third party cookies and similar technologies on Nextdoor.\n<br>4.\nWhat cookies does Nextdoor use, and why?\nThe cookies used on our Services are categorized as follows: <ul>\n<li>Strictly necessary cookies</li>\n<li>Functional cookies</li>\n<li>Targeting cookies</li>\n<li>Performance cookies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<br>\n<em>Strictly necessary</em> cookies are necessary for our Services to function.\nYou can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of our Services will not work and we will not be able to guarantee how our Services will perform during your visit.<br>\n<br>\n<em>Functional cookies </em>enable us to provide you with enhanced functionality and personalization.\nIf you do not add these cookies then some of our Services may not function properly.<br>\n<br>\n<em>Targeting cookies</em> are used to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant information and advertisements.\nIf you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.<br>\n<br>\n<em>Performance cookies</em> collect information about how you use our Services (e.g., which pages you visit and if you experience any errors).\nThese cookies are used to help us improve how our Services work, understand what interests our users, and measure how effective our content is.\nIf you do not allow these cookies, we will not know when you have visited our site.<br>\n<br>Nextdoor uses both session cookies and persistent cookies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We use <u>\n<em>session cookies</em>\n</u> to identify you during a particular visit to Nextdoor.\nSession cookies expire after a short time, or when you close your web browser or app after using Nextdoor.</li>\n<li>We use <em>\n<u>persistent cookies</u>\n</em> to identify you over a long period of time.\nFor example, if you asked us to keep you signed in, we would use a persistent cookie for that purpose.\nPersistent cookies remain on your device for a set period of time specified in the cookie.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<br>We use both first and third party cookies to operate, understand, and improve Nextdoor, specifically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<u>\n<em>To authenticate you and secure our Services</em>\n</u>\n<em>.&nbsp;</em>We use cookies to monitor login, session and status data.\nThis allows us to know, for example, whether you are logged in.</li>\n<li>\n<u>\n<em>To remember your settings and preferences.</em>\n</u> We use cookies to recognize your browser and remember your preferences.\nFor example, we use cookies to remember your language preferences.</li>\n<li>\n<u>\n<em>To carry out analytics and research.</em>\n</u> We use cookies to understand your use of Nextdoor and how we can improve our offerings.\nFor example, we use cookies to track what pages you visit and whether you open emails we send you.</li>\n<li>\n<u>\n<em>To personalize your experience.</em>\n</u>\n<em>\n</em>We use cookies to personalize your use of Nextdoor, including to serve you personalized advertising that may better suit your needs.</li>\n<li>\n<u>\n<em>For fraud, trust and safety, and investigations.</em>\n</u> We use cookies to keep our Services safe, including to detect and prevent fraud and conduct investigations.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>5.\nWhat third-party cookies are used on Nextdoor?\nA number of third party cookies are set on Nextdoor, some of which depend on how you use our Services.\nIn general, the following types of third party cookies may be set when you use Nextdoor: <ul>\n<li>\n<u>\n<em>Social media login cookies.</em>\n</u> If you register or sign in using a social media login, that social media site may set a cookie.</li>\n<li>\n<u>\n<em>Analytics cookies.</em>\n</u> We use analytics cookies to collect traffic data to help us analyze how Members and Visitors access and use Nextdoor, and for other analytics services relating to website activity and internet usage.</li>\n<li>\n<u>\n<em>Advertising cookies</em>\n</u>.\nOur Services allow third party advertising companies that we work with to use cookies to collect information about how you use Nextdoor as well as other sites and services over time.\nThese companies use the information they collect to show you ads they believe will be relevant to you on Nextdoor and elsewhere, and to measure how the ads perform.</li>\n<li>\n<em>\n<u>Third-party cookies from content shared by Members.</u>\n</em> Members may share content on Nextdoor that originates from a third-party website or service, and that third-party website or service may set its own cookies when you interact with that content.\nFor example, if a Member posts a video from YouTube on Nextdoor, YouTube may set a cookie when you click to watch the video.</li>\n<li>\n<u>\n<em>Pixels.</em>\n</u> Our advertising partners may use pixels or similar technology to measure the success of the sponsored posts or other advertising products they use.\nA \u201cpixel\u201d (also sometimes called web beacon, or clear GIF) is a tiny piece of code, invisible to the user, placed on a webpage or in an email and used in combination with a cookie, to link a given activity or impression back to the user.\nthe advertiser includes the pixel in its content so the advertiser can measure whether our Members interact with that content (for example, by clicking to view an offer).\nWe may set our own pixel on an advertiser\u2019s website so we can measure whether our Members found the advertiser\u2019s content effective or interesting, by determining whether the sponsored post prompted Members to take advantage of the advertised offer.\nThis information helps us assess whether sponsored posts and other advertising offers are relevant and interesting to our Members and successful for the advertiser.</li>\n<li>\n<em>\n<u>SDKs.</u>\n</em> We and our partners and service providers include SDKs in the Nextdoor apps.\nSDKs include third party code and allow us to understand how our app is used and what actions occur in relation to the app, including when a Member signs up or logs in.\nSDKs are also used for advertising purposes including for measurement, personalization and to create similar audiences to advertise to.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>These cookies, the third parties that set them, the purposes of such cookies and the means by which you can opt out, are listed in the table further below.\n<p>\n<strong>Third Party</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Privacy

for third party personalized advertising?\nYes, here is how: <ul>\n<li>\n<u>\n<em>Browsers.</em>\n</u> You may refuse or restrict the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser.\nHowever, limiting or refusing cookies may affect your ability to use Nextdoor.\nFor more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your computer or mobile

information.\nThe Digital Advertising Alliance also provides a mobile app called AppChoices that lets you opt-out of interest based advertising from participating advertisers.</li>\n<li>\n<u>\n<em>Third parties.</em>\n</u> Some of the third party advertising partners that we work with offer opt-out mechanisms, as listed in the table above.\nSince we do not control any of these opt-out links, we are not responsible for the availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using these opt-out services will not prevent you from seeing all ads, but they may make the ads you do see less relevant to you.\nYou may also need to set these opt-out preferences on each browser or device that you use.</p>\n<br>7.\nChanges to this policy.\nOur business changes constantly and our cookie policy will also change, so please review it frequently.\nWe will notify you of any changes by posting the updated policy on this page with its effective date.\nIf the change is material, we will take reasonable steps to notify you in advance as required by applicable law.\n<br>8.\nQuestions.\nFor more information about how we collect, use and share
