10.&nbsp;<strong>Disclaimers</strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n<p> Our Service and all content on EPAL.GG are provided on an \u201cas is\u201d basis without warranty of any kind, whether express or implied.\n</p>\n<p> EPAL.GG SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.\n</p>\n<p> EPAL.GG takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other user or third-party posts or sends using our

11.&nbsp;<strong>Limitation </strong>\n<strong>of</strong>\n<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>Liability</strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n<p> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EPAL.GG SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL EPAL.GG\u2019S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATED TO THE SERVICE EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED US DOLLARS (US $100.00) OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO EPAL.GG FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS FOR THE SERVICE.\n</p>\n<p> To the extent that any claim, dispute or controversy regarding EPAL.GG or our Service isn\u2019t arbitrable under applicable laws or otherwise: you and EPAL.GG both agree that any claim or dispute regarding EPAL.GG will be resolved exclusively in accordance with Section 13 of these Terms.\n</p> 12.&nbsp;<strong>Arbitration</strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n<p> For any dispute you have with EPAL.GG, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.\nIf we need to contact you, we will do so at the email address associated with your Account.\nIf EPAL.GG has not been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms through binding arbitration or (for qualifying claims) in small claims court.\n</p>\n<p> Arbitration is a more informal way to resolve our disagreements than a lawsuit in court.\nFor instance, arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, involves more limited discovery, and is subject to very limited review by courts.\nAlthough the process is more informal, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\nYou agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Use, the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision and that you and EPAL.GG are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.\nThe arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.\nThis arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your Business&nbsp;Account.\n</p>\n<p> Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) under the Consumer Arbitration Rules then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein.\nYou can find their forms at www.adr.org.\nUnless you and EPAL.GG agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in Los Angeles County.\nEach party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules.\nIf your claim is for $10,000&nbsp;or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.\nIf your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision explaining the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, and any judgement on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nNothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts, including for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the Service.\n</p>\n<p> ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES\u2019 INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON\u2019S CLAIMS.\nYOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND EPAL.GG ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.\n</p>\n<p> NOTHING IN THESE TERMS OF USE SHALL AFFECT ANY NON-WAIVABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS THAT APPLY TO YOU.\nTo the extent any claim, dispute or controversy regarding EPAL.GG or our Service isn\u2019t arbitrable under applicable laws or otherwise, you and EPAL.GG both agree that any claim or dispute regarding EPAL.GG will be resolved exclusively in accordance with Section 13 of these Terms.\n</p> 13.&nbsp;<strong>Governing </strong>\n<strong>Law and</strong>\n<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>Jurisdiction</strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n<p> These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.\nThe exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from or in connection with this agreement is Los Angeles County, California or the United States District Court for the Central District of California and our dispute will be determined under California law.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.\nCookie Policy</strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p> EPAL.GG uses certain
