the Covercraft website, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.\nThis Privacy Policy applies only to the information collected through this Website and not any information collected or obtained through other methods or sources.<p>\"Public\" information will include that information such as your demographic information such as gender, name, age, birth date, purchase history information, browsing history information, zip code, and geographical location or any other information deemed necessary by Covercraft.</p>\n<p>\"Private\" information is information that can personally identify you such as your full name, email address, or credit card number.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What information do we collect?</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> We collect information from you when you register on the site, place an order, enter a contest or sweepstakes, respond to a survey or communication such as e-mail, or participate in another site feature.</li>\n<li>When ordering or registering, we may ask you for your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, credit card information or other information.\nYou may, however, visit our site anonymously.</li>\n<li>We also collect information about gift recipients so that we can fulfill the gift purchase.\nThe information we collect about gift recipients is not used for marketing purposes.</li>\n<li>Like many websites,

herein.</p>\n<p>Covercraft may use demographic information to tailor the Website and communications to your interests, and we may share demographic information with advertisers or other third parties on an anonymous and aggregated basis such that individual private information or behavior may not be determined (i.e., without telling the advertisers your identity).\nOur sharing of demographic information is anonymous (i.e., we do not tell which particular users are members of which demographic groups), subject to the rest of this Privacy Policy.\nIf you respond to an advertisement and give the advertiser your personal information, then the advertiser may be able to identify you as being a member of that demographic group.</p>\n<p>We also may disclose your personal information or financial information to our subsidiary and parent companies and businesses, and other affiliated legal entities and businesses with whom we are under common corporate control.\nWhenever personal information or financial information is disclosed under this paragraph we may also disclose your demographic information, on a non-anonymous basis.\nAll of our parent, subsidiary and affiliated legal entities and businesses that receive your personal information, financial information, or non-anonymous demographic information from us will comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy with respect to their use and disclosure of such information.</p>\n<p>To operate the Website, including processing your transactions and supporting your activities on the Website, we may share your personal information with our agents, representatives, contractors and service providers so they can provide us with support services such as authorization of credit card transactions, email origination, receipt or support services, customer relationship management services, order fulfillment and sweepstakes and promotional fulfillment.\nBy purchasing, or registering or making reservations for, products or services offered or sponsored by third parties on the Website, or electing to receive communications (such as emails or magazine subscriptions) or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes or other programs (such as discount or rewards programs), offered or sponsored by third parties on the Website, you consent to our providing your personal information to those third parties.\nThose third parties may use your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies.\nYou will need to contact those third parties to instruct them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them.\nAdditionally, you agree that we may use and disclose all such information so submitted to such third parties in the same manner in which we are entitled to use and disclose any other information you submit to us.</p>\n<p>We may also use the information we collect from you when you register, purchase products, enter a contest or

browser activity, and browser settings.\nWe use your IP and/or Mac address to avoid fraudulent registrations, and monitor site usage demographics and dynamics.\nInformation that we may obtain regarding your browser and browser settings may be used to ensure that our site's technical features are available to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>How do we protect visitor information?</strong>\n<br>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information.\nYour personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.\nWhen you place orders or access your personal information, we offer the use of a secure server.\nAll sensitive/credit information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our databases to be only accessed as stated above.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Do we use \"cookies\"?</strong>\n<br>Yes.\nCookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.\nFor instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart.\nThey are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services.\nWe also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>\n<p>We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors.\nThese service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.</p>\n<p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies.\nYou do this through your browser (like Firefox or Internet Explorer) settings.\nEach browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.\nIf you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your site experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly.\nHowever, you can still place orders over the telephone by contacting customer service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Single-Pixel Gifs</strong>\n<br>Covercraft and its advertisers may use single-pixel gifs (also known as web bugs, web beacons, or tracking pixels) on the Website.\nThe purpose of these single-pixel gifs is to verify and count web page accesses and gather some statistical information.\nThese single-pixel gifs gather usage and demographic information, but do not gather any personal information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Email</strong>\n<br>To enhance your experience, we may send out message notifications, newsletters and site announcements, and from time to time third party offers from companies that we feel may have something that will benefit you.\nOur Website provides you with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving different types of communications (except system communications, or communications required for account maintenance), and each e-mail that we send out has a method for opting-out located at the bottom of the message.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Opt-Out and CAN-SPAM Act</strong>\n<br>At any time, you may choose not to receive promotional e-mails from Covercraft by following the \"unsubscribe\" instructions in the applicable e-mail.\nNote that unsubscribing from one e-mail list does not automatically unsubscribe you from any other e-mail list that you may be on.\nPlease read the e-mail carefully to find out which list you are unsubscribing from.\nTo delete all of your online account information from our database, sign into the \"My Account\" section of our site and remove your shipping addresses, billing addresses &amp.\npayment information.\nPlease note that we may maintain information about an individual sales transaction in order to service that transaction and for record keeping.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Children Under Eighteen</strong>\n<br>Covercraft does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of eighteen.\nIf you are under
