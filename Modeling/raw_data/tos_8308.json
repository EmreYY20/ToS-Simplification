COPYRIGHT MATERIAL AND PROOF OF OWNERSHIP OF CONTENT</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Sites must not contain Warez, copyright or other illegal material including links or redirects to copyright material hosted on 3rd party websites / resources.\nThe onus is on you the customer to prove that you own the rights to publish material, not for iFastNet to prove that you do not.\niFastNet does not allow the propagation or distribution of copyright material, files or warez under any circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>ACCEPTABLE SERVER RESOURCE USE</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Sites must not use excessive amounts of server resources.\nThese include bandwidth, processor utilization and / or disk space.\nPlease see the 'High Resource Use Policy' in the General Terms and Conditions.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>SCRIPT USAGE TERMS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Scripts on the site must be designed to produce web-based content, and not to use the server as an application server.\nUsing the server to generate large volumes of email from a database is an example of activity that is not allowed.\nScripts should not attempt to manipulate the timeouts on servers.\nThese are set at the present values to ensure the reliability of the server.\nSites that reset these do so because they are resource intensive, and adversely affect server performance and are therefore not allowed.\nScripts that are designed to provide proxy services, anonymous or otherwise, are not allowed.</p>\n<p>The primary purpose of any script must be to produce a web page.\nScripts that send a single email based upon user entered information, or update a database are acceptable.\nScripts that send bulk email or perform processor intensive database processes are not allowed.\nAll outgoing mail is monitored and filtered and must be sent to or from a iFastNet-hosted domain.</p>\n<p>Sites must not contain scripts that attempt to access privileged server resources, or other sites on the same server.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>USAGE OF DISK SPACE TERMS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>iFastNet offers large web space and bandwidth with hosting accounts.\nBy this, we mean space for legitimate web site content and bandwidth for visitors to view it.\nAll files on a domain must be part of the active website and linked to the site.\nSites should not contain any backups, downloads, or other non-web based content.\nWe will treat all password protected archive (e.g.\nzip and rar) files as unacceptable.\nMultimedia content such as audio and video is acceptable provided it is streamed to the user, links to HTTP download of this content is not acceptable.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>INODE USAGE</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In computing, an inode is a data structure on a traditional Unix-style file system such as UFS.\nAn inode stores basic information about a regular file, directory, or other file system object.\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode</p>\n<p>iFastNet reserves the right to limit INODEs usage on premium hosting plans to 180,000 and unlimited inodes on Business hosting plans subject to acceptable usage.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Right to suspend / terminate hosting services</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate any hosting services if a website/hosting service consumes excessive server resources or effects other websites / hosting services on a shared or clustered hosting server.\nExcessive resource usage can constitute any form of server usage calculated and determined at the discretion of iFastNet.\niFastNet reserves the right to suspend service at any time without prior notice if or when the health or normal running / performance of a service is effected / degraded by a website or hosting service.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge that iFastNet may or may not pre-screen Content, but that iFastNet and its designees shall have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse, or remove any Content that is available via the Service.\nWithout limiting the foregoing, iFastNet and its designees

without limitation information in iFastNet Message Boards and in all other parts of the Service.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge, consent and agree that iFastNet may access, preserve and disclose your account information and Content if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to:</p>\n<p>(a) comply with legal process;</p>\n<p>(b) enforce the TOS;</p>\n<p>(c) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third parties;</p>\n<p>(d) respond to your requests for customer service.\nor (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of iFastNet, its users and the public.</p>\n<p>You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the Service, including your Content, may involve</p>\n<p>(a) transmissions over various networks.\nand</p>\n<p>(b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.</p>\n<p>You understand that the Service and software embodied within the Service may include security components that permit digital materials to be protected, and that use of these materials is subject to usage rules set by iFastNet and/or content providers who provide content to the Service.\nYou may not attempt to override or circumvent any of the usage rules embedded into the Service.\nAny unauthorized reproduction, publication, further distribution or public exhibition of the materials provided on the Service, in whole or in part, is strictly prohibited.</p>\n<strong>7.\nINTERSTATE NATURE OF COMMUNICATIONS ON iFastNet NETWORK</strong>\n<p>When you register with iFastNet, you acknowledge that in using iFastNet services to send electronic communications (including but not limited to email, uploading photos and files and other Internet activities), you will be causing communications to be sent through iFastNet's computer networks, portions of which are located in California, Ohio, UK, and other locations in the

Ltd.\ncares about and respects your privacy.\nFor this reason, we collect and use personal data only as it might be needed for us to deliver to you our products, services and websites (collectively, our \"Services\").\nYour personal data includes information such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name</li>\n<li>Address</li>\n<li>Telephone number</li>\n<li>Date of birth</li>\n<li>Email address</li>\n<li>Other data collected that could directly or indirectly identify you</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our Privacy Policy is intended to describe to you how and what data we collect, and how and why we use your personal data.\nIt also describes options we provide for you to access, update or otherwise take control of your personal data that we process.</p>\n<p>If at any time you have questions about our practices or any of your rights described below, you may reach our Data Protection Officer (\"DPO\") and our dedicated team by contacting us at support.ifastnet.com.\nThis inbox is actively monitored and managed so that we can provide you with information you can confidently trust.</p>\n<p>We have also have a ticket system to provide answers to your most common questions, additional instructions on how to exercise rights that might be available to you, documentation you may need, and definitions to key terms and concepts in this Privacy Policy.</p> What information do we collect?\n<p>We collect information to provide the best possible experience when you use our Services.\nMuch of what you consider personal data is collected directly from you when you:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> create an account or purchase any of our Services (e.g.: billing information, including name, address, and credit card number);</li>\n<li>request assistance from our Customer Services team (e.g.: telephone number);</li>\n<li>complete contact forms or request newsletters or other information from us (e.g.: email courses, e-books, or emails).\nor</li>\n<li>participate in contests and surveys, apply for a job, or otherwise participate in activities we promote that might require information about you.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>However, we also collect additional information when delivering our Services to you to ensure necessary and optimal performance.\nThese methods of collection may not be as obvious, so we wanted to explain what these might be (as they vary from time to time) and how they work:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Account related information</strong> is collected in association with your use of our Services, such as account number, products you have purchased, when products renew or expire, information requests, support requests, and notes or details on our interactions.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies and similar technologies</strong> on our websites allow us to track your browsing behaviour, links clicked, items purchased, and your device types.\nThey also allow us to collect data (including analytics) about how you use and interact with our Services.\nThis allows us to provide you with more relevant product offerings, a better experience on our sites and mobile applications, and to collect, analyse, and improve the performance of our Services.\nWe may also collect your location via Internet Protocol (IP) address, so that we can personalise our Services.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data about Usage of Services</strong> is automatically collected when you use and interact with our Services, including metadata, log files, cookie/device IDs, and location information.\nThis information includes specific data about your interactions with the features, content, and links (including third-parties, such as social media plugins) contained within the Services, IP address, browser type and settings (including configuration and plug-ins), the date and time the Services were used, language preferences and cookie data, and information about devices accessing the Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers, and error data.\nSome of this data collected might be capable of and be used to approximate your location.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Supplemented Data</strong> may be received about you from other sources, including publicly available databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data, in which case we may combine this data with information we already have about you so that we can update, expand, and analyse the accuracy of our records, identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you.\nIf you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.</p>\nHow we use information.\n<p>We strongly believe in both reducing the amount of data we collect and limiting the use and purpose of that data to only:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Data for which we have been given permission</li>\n<li>Data necessary to deliver the Services you purchase or interact with</li>\n<li>Data we might be required or permitted to keep for legal compliance or other lawful purposes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These uses include: <strong>Delivering, improving, updating, and enhancing the Services we provide to you</strong>.\nWe collect information relating to your purchase, use, and/or interactions with our Services.\nWe utilise this information to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve and optimise the operation and performance of our Services (again, including our websites and mobile applications)</li>\n<li>Diagnose problems with and identify any security risks, errors, or needed enhancements to the Services</li>\n<li>Detect and prevent fraud and abuse of our Services and systems</li>\n<li>Collecting aggregate statistics about use of the Services</li>\n<li>Understand and analyse how you use our Services and what products and services are most relevant to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Often, much of the data we collect is aggregated or statistical data about how individuals use our Services, and is not linked to any personal data., But as it is itself personal data, or it can be linked or linkable to personal data, we treat it accordingly.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sharing with trusted third parties</strong>.\nWe may share your personal data with affiliated companies within our corporate family, with third parties with which we have partnered to allow you to integrate their services into our own Services, and with trusted third-party service providers as necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Processing credit card payments</li>\n<li>Serving advertisements</li>\n<li>Conducting contests or surveys</li>\n<li>Performing analysis of our Services and customer demographics</li>\n<li>Communicating with you, such as by way email or survey delivery</li>\n<li>Customer relationship management.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We only share your personal data as necessary for any third party to provide the services as requested or as needed on our behalf.\nThese third parties (and any subcontractors) are subject to strict data processing terms and conditions and are prohibited from utilising, sharing or retaining your personal data for any purpose other than as they have been specifically contracted for (or without your consent).\nFor further information on our

your control panel.\n</p>\n<p>If we collect information from you in connection with a co-branded offer, it will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the information and whose privacy policy applies.\nIn addition, it will describe any options you have in regards to the use and/or sharing of your personal data with a co-branded partner, as well as how to exercise those options.</p>\n<p>If you make use of a service that allows you to import contacts (e.g.\nusing email marketing services to send emails on your behalf), we will only use the contacts and any other personal information needed for the requested service.\nIf you believe that anyone has provided us with your personal information and you would like to request that it be removed from our database,

or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.</p>\n<p>To the extent we are legally permitted to do so, we will take reasonable steps to notify you in the event that we are required to provide your personal information to third parties as part of legal process.\nWe will also share your information to the extent necessary to comply with ICANN or any ccTLD rules, regulations, and policies when you register a domain name with us.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Website analytics.</strong> We use multiple web analytics tools provided by service partners such as Google Analytics and
