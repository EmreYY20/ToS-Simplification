law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Right to request disclosure of personal information we collect and share about you</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You can request the following information about how we have collected and used your personal information during the past 12 months:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The categories of personal information we have collected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The categories of sources from which we

Services, and you desire to have your personal information deleted from Paysafe, you must contact Paysafe directly to make such a request.\nPlease note that due to applicable laws and regulations, you will be unable to use some of our Services if your personal information is deleted, including, but not limited to, ordering lottery tickets.\nAs noted above, your deletion request is subject to certain exceptions which we may rely on where it is necessary for us to:<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Complete the transaction for which the personal information was collected, provide a good or service requested by you, or reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform a contract between you and us;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Detect

you provided the information.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Right to ask us not to sell your personal information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We do not sell your personal information.\nHowever, like many companies, we may use advertising services that try to tailor online ads to your interests based on information collected via cookies and similar technologies about your online activity.\nThis is called interest-based advertising.\nThe CCPA\u2019s statutory definition of the term \u201csale\u201d is broad and may include interest-based advertising.\nYou can get more information and opt-out of the use of cookies on our Services for interest-based advertising purposes by setting your preferences on the App or our website.\nYou will need to set your preferences from each device and each web browser from which you wish to opt-out.\nThis feature may use a cookie to remember your preference, so if you clear all cookies from your browser, you may need to re-set your

CCPA.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How to exercise your rights</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may submit requests to exercise your California privacy rights described above as

also exercise these access and deletion rights by emailing privacyrequests@jackpocket.com.\nYou may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice in a 12-month period.\nThe verifiable consumer request must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative of that person;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These rights are not absolute, and in some instances, we may decline your request as permitted by law.\nWe will need to verify your identity to process your disclosure and deletion rights and reserve the right to confirm your California residency.\nTo verify your identity, we may require you to log into your Jackpocket account (if applicable), provide government identification, give a declaration as to your identity under penalty of perjury, and/or provide additional information.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your authorized agent may make a request on your behalf upon our verification of the agent\u2019s identity and our receipt of a copy of the valid power of attorney given to your authorized agent pursuant to California Probate Code Sections 4000-4465.\nIf you have not provided your agent with such a power of attorney, you must provide your agent with written and signed permission to exercise your CCPA rights on your behalf, provide the information we request to verify your identity and provide us with written confirmation that you have given the authorized agent permission to submit the request.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Shine the Light</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the State of California have the right to request from companies conducting business in California certain information regarding Jackpocket\u2019s disclosure within the immediately preceding calendar year of that California resident\u2019s personal information to third parties (and in some cases affiliates) for their direct marketing purposes.\nAlternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, by disclosing in its privacy policy that it provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing personal information with third parties and affiliates for those third parties\u2019 and affiliates\u2019 direct marketing purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice.\nWe do not currently share personal information with third parties or affiliates for those third parties\u2019 or affiliates\u2019 direct marketing purposes.\nHowever, if we do so in the future, we intend to provide you with a choice prior to sharing your personal information with third parties and affiliates for their direct marketing purposes.\nIf you do not opt-in or if you do not choose to opt-out at the time Jackpocket offers that choice, Jackpocket will not share your information with that identified third party or affiliate for its direct marketing purposes.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing information with third parties and affiliates for their direct marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please send your request to the following email address: support@jackpocket.com.&nbsp.\nYou must put the statement \u201cYour California Privacy Rights\u201d in the subject field of your e-mail.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How we respond to Do Not Track signals&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>California Business &amp.\nProfessions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how companies respond to \"Do Not Track\" browser settings.\nJackpocket does not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed.\nWe continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nChildren Under the Age of 13\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.\nIf you are under 13, do not use or provide any information on or through our App or our Services.\nIf it is discovered that we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13, this information will be deleted.\nIf you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at&nbsp;support@jackpocket.com.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Transactions through our App and our Services are limited to those meeting the age requirements in the applicable jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nInformation Security\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The security of your personal information is extremely important.\nWe maintain commercially reasonable technical, administrative, physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of personal information provided to us.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>However, no communication over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure.\nAlthough we take care to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you provide to us, so you do so at your own risk.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The security of your information and account with us is also dependent on you.\nPlease
