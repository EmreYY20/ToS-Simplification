store on the user\u2019s local computer, and then later their browser presents this information to the web server.\nIn its simplest form, a cookie is an identifying number.</p>\n<p>\n<b>5.2 What type of cookies do we use?</b>\n</p>\n<p>We use two types of cookies on Forum Sites: persistent cookies and session cookies.\nA persistent cookie helps us recognize you as an existing user, so it's easier to return to Forum Sites or interact with our services without signing in again.\nIn the event you sign up to one of our platforms, a persistent cookie stays in your browser and will be read by the service when you return to one of our sites.\nSession cookies only last as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).\n</p>\n<p>We use cookies for anonymous user tracking.\nThe Forum web server assigns each user a unique numerical ID (\u201c<b>ID</b>\u201d).\nAll requests for pages are tagged with that ID, and by analyzing the log files, the Forum can determine how many unique users use Forum Sites.</p>\n<p>\n<b>5.3 How do we use cookies?</b>\n</p>\n<p>The Forum does not know the identity of a person based on the ID.\nThe cookies used by the Forum do not contain any personal data about you nor are they used to look up your personal data.\nEven if you have entered personal data about yourself in one of the Forum\u2019s registration forms, the Forum does not relate that information to the cookie data.</p>\n<p>The Forum Sites may use cookies for analytics and to improve your user experience.\nForum Sites will usually not natively use cookies but our analytics providers do use these cookies to improve user experience.\n</p>\n<p>Our analytics providers include: </p>\n<p>- Google [Privacy Policy]</p>\n<p>- parse.ly [Privacy Policy]</p>\n<p>- mix panel [Privacy Policy]</p>\n<p>These providers use cookies to tailor your user experience, gather statistics on usage and engagement and help better inform the Forum\u2019s efforts to deliver world-class engagement, knowledge and events.\n</p>\n<p>You are free to decline the cookies if your browser or browser add-on allows, except if the cookies are required to prevent fraud or ensure the security of Forum Sites that the Forum controls.\nHowever, disabling the use of cookies will result in a less user-friendly experience of the Forum Sites or can fully prevent you from using the Forum Sites.</p>\n<p>\n<b>6.\nHow do we store or transfer your data?</b>\n</p>\n<p>The Forum has offices and facilities in Switzerland, the United States, Japan and China.\nThe hosting facilities for our websites and Forum Custom Platforms are situated in Switzerland and the EU, the Chinese website is hosted in Singapore.\n</p>\n<p>When transferring personal data internationally, we make sure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations, for example, by entering into agreements that will ensure that the recipients of your information maintain an adequate level of data protection.</p>\n<p>Information collected within the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) may, for example, be transferred to countries outside of the EEA for the purposes as described in this Policy.\nWe utilize standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission, adopt other means under Swiss and European Union law and/or obtain your consent to legitimize data transfers from the EEA to the United States and other countries.</p>\n<p>\n<b>7.\nSecurity of personal data</b>\n</p>\n<p>The Forum is committed to protecting the security of your personal data.\nAny information provided to the Forum by you is handled with due care and security, and will not be used in ways other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy, or in any site/area-specific policies, or in ways to which users have not explicitly consented.\nThe Forum employs a range of technologies and security measures to protect the information maintained on Forum systems from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction.\n</p>\n<p>However, since the internet is not a 100% secure environment, the Forum cannot ensure nor guarantee the security of any information that the user may transmit to Forum Sites.\nThere is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of any of the Forum\u2019s physical, technical or managerial safeguards.</p>\n<p>All Forum employees who have access to and are associated with the processing of personal data are obliged to respect the confidentiality of all such personal data.</p>\n<p>\n<b>8.\nHow long do we retain personal data?</b>\n</p>\n<p>The Forum will retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and/or as long we require the personal data to provide you with the Forum services or products you requested, unless a longer retention period is required to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</p>\n<p>\n<b>9.\nHow can you access your data or contact us?</b>\n</p>\n<p>You have a right to request access to your personal data.\nYou may send us a request for access, provision of such information will be subject to the supply of appropriate evidence of your identity.\nYou also have the right to request that the Forum corrects any inaccuracies in your personal data.\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to opt out of receiving marketing communications or any other information from the Forum or about Forum events and can do so by (a) following the
