{"id": 14143, "name": "Privacy Policy", "url": "https://www.ip2location.com/privacy-policy", "xpath": "/html/body/div[2]", "text": " IP2Location Privacy Policy <p>Effective on: January 1, 2020</p>\n<p>Last updated on January 1, 2023</p> Introduction and Scope <p> Hexasoft Development Sdn.\nBhd.\n(\u201cHexasoft\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour\u201d) takes the protection of your personally identifiable information (\u201cPersonal Data\u201d) very seriously.\nThis privacy policy (the \u201cNotice\u201d) addresses data subjects whose Personal Data we may process in three separate ways: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, it addresses Personal Data we process in our IP2Location application (the \u201cApp\u201d) or in our IP2Location database (the \u201cDatabase\u201d) or in our IP geolocation solution located at https://www.ip2location.com and accompanying API (collectively, with the App and the Database, the \u201cService\u201d).</li>\n<li>Second, it explains our privacy practices in connection with Personal Data we may collect about you when you contact us or access our IP2Location website located at https://www.ip2location.com (the \u201cWebsite\u201d).</li>\n<li>Third, it addresses Personal Data we collect or store from current, prospective, and former customers of our Service.</li>\n</ul> Unless clearly stated otherwise, the contents of this policy apply to the processing of all three types of Personal Data.\n<p>\n</p> Who Are We? <p> We collect IP Address information, coupled with some high-level geolocation data which we store in the Service.\nMany of our customers use this information to provide the right services to the right people.\nFor example, the data we provide might help a streaming service provide the right content to international users or an e-commerce website to show only the clothing options that ship to a particular region.\n</p>\n<p> We work very hard to protect the Personal Data we do collect and to ensure that the Personal Data we collect is appropriate for the services we provide.\nYou can view the information we typically collect about your device and location for use in the Service by visiting this demo page of our Website.\nYou can request that we delete or not sell the Personal Data we have about you at any time via the process described below.\n</p>\n<p> With respect to all three categories of Personal Data we collect (Personal Data we collect directly for the Service, Personal Data we receive from users of our Website, and Personal Data we are provided by business contacts and prospects of Hexasoft), we decide the purposes and means of processing your Personal Data.\nConsequently, we act as a data controller or \u201cbusiness\u201d under the relevant Privacy Laws like the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) (together with other privacy laws, \u201cthe Applicable Laws\u201d).\n</p> What Data Do We Collect About You? <p>\n<strong>Data Used In The Service:</strong> The Personal Data we collect for use in our Service is described in detail in the Table below.\nWith respect to the Personal Data used in the Service we only collect IP Addresses and certain coarse geolocation and Internet Service Provider information associated with that IP Address.\n</p>\n<p> Most of the IP Address and geolocation Personal Data we collect is publicly accessible by anyone using networking diagnostic commands such as ping or traceroute.\nIt is also coarse geolocation data, meaning that we collect your postal or ZIP code and city-level GPS coordinates, but not your street, name, or mailing address.\n</p>\n<p> Because we only collect your IP Address coupled with coarse, high-level geolocation information, we do not think the information we collect is reasonably capable of being associated with or could be reasonably linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.\nAs a result, it is possible a court would decide this information would not constitute Personal Data as defined under some or all of the Applicable Laws.\nBy disclosing this information, we do not waive any rights to argue that this information should be understood as de-identified or otherwise not Personal Data.\n</p>\n<p> Because we cannot associate the data in the Service with any person except to identify unique IP Addresses, exercising some of your data subject rights could be complicated, as discussed below, and in some cases, we may require additional information from your Internet Service Provider to do so.\nThis is especially true if you have a dynamic IP Address as opposed to a static one.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Collected Via Website or Customers:</strong> When you visit our Website, contact us directly, or are a current, prospective, or former customer of our Service, we may collect and process the following categories of Personal Data about you: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identifiers: first and last name, user name, email address, mailing address, company name, phone number, IP Address.</li>\n<li>Special Categories of Personal Data (as defined in the CCPA): Bank account numbers, credit card numbers, or other financial account information.</li>\n<li>Commercial Information: records of products or services purchased from us, or considered.</li>\n<li>Internet or other similar network activity: Information about your interaction with our website and our advertising for the Service.\nwhether you are using a proxy server.\ninformation about which Internet Service provider you are using and their location.\ninternet connection speed, ISP domain name.\nmobile carrier and usage type information.</li>\n<li>Geolocation data: your address, country, region, city, ZIP code, time zone, weather station, and other geolocation data.</li>\n<li>Other Personal Data: Feedback you may provide through our website, or exercise your Data Subject Rights Requests, to the extent it contains Personal Data not already described above.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p> What This Policy Doesn\u2019t Cover: <p> This Notice does not apply to the Personal Data of our employees, job applicants, contractors, business owners, directors, officers, and other staff.\n</p> Lawful Bases for Processing <p> We must have a valid reason to use your Personal Data.\nIt's called the \"lawful basis for processing\".\nWithin the scope of this Notice, we may rely on one or more of the following lawful grounds for processing of your Personal Data: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>to perform our obligations to you in cases where you have purchased the Service from us, or in order to help you make a purchase, upon your request;</li>\n<li>our legitimate interests and the legitimate interests of our customers for the purpose of facilitating the fulfillment of their business needs, which may include the detection and prevention of credit card fraud, password sharing or abuse of service, compliance with export control and sanctions, content localization, digital rights management, spam filtering, etc..\nand</li>\n<li>any other ground, as required or permitted by law in the specific respective context.</li>\n</ul> Where we receive your Personal Data as part of providing our Services to you based on a contract, we require such Personal Data to be able to carry out the contract.\nWithout that necessary Personal Data, we will not be able to provide the Services to you.\n<p>\n</p> Processing of Personal Data <p>\n<strong>Data Used In The Service:</strong> We process certain categories of Personal Data in our Service for the purposes of identifying the geographical location of an individual or an IT system and providing this information to our customers.\nOur customers then decide how to use this information.\nWe understand our customers often use this information for geo-fencing.\nThat is, they may use this information to limit the content they show or services they provide based on the location of the individual or IT system trying to access it.\nThey may also use the Personal Data we process to identify whether you are using a proxy server, to comply with export control laws and sanctions, web traffic analysis, digital rights management, geographical targeting for advertising or other purposes, and spam-filtering by location.\n</p>\n<p> The Table below contains more information about how we collect Personal Data for the Service and the categories of third parties with whom we share Personal Data used in the Service.\n</p>\n<p> Data Collected Via Website or Customers: Additionally, if you access our website, contact us, or sign up as a customer for our Service, we process Personal Data: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>to respond to your inquiries, and/or other requests or questions;</li>\n<li>to sell our services to you, including processing your payments;</li>\n<li>to pay commissions to our affiliates;</li>\n<li>to identify how you interact with our Website;</li>\n<li>to improve our Website;</li>\n<li>to enable us to send you our newsletter.\nand</li>\n<li>for logging and statistical purposes.</li>\n</ul> We don\u2019t collect additional categories of Personal Data without informing you.\n<p>\n</p> Sharing Personal Data with Third Parties <p> We may use third-party vendors to perform certain services on our behalf.\nWe may share your Personal Data with these third-party vendors solely to enable them to perform the services for us.\nIn providing them with your Personal Data, we require that these third-party vendors maintain at least the same level of data protection that we maintain for your Personal Data.\nWe do not provide your Personal Data to parties unconnected with the services we provide.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Collected Via Website or Customers:</strong> For visitors to our website, individuals who contact us directly or who are current, prospective, or former clients, we share the Personal Data we collect about you with certain third-party vendors who perform services on our behalf.\nThese third-party vendors include those providing: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>infrastructure services;</li>\n<li>payment processing services;</li>\n<li>service desk and bug tracking software services.\nand

legal proceedings initiated by governmental and/or law enforcement officials, or private parties, including but not limited to: in response to subpoenas, search warrants, or court orders.\nIf we have to disclose your Personal Data to governmental/law enforcement officials, we may not be able to ensure that those officials will maintain the privacy and security of your Personal Data.;</li>\n<li>if we sell or transfer all or some of our company\u2019s business interests, assets, or both, or in connection with a corporate restructuring.\nor</li>\n<li>to our subsidiaries or affiliates only if

respect to Personal Data that we process about you when we act as a \u201cdata controller\u201d under the GDPR or as a \u201cbusiness\u201d under the CCPA.\nThis is when Hexasoft decides why and how your Personal Data will be processed, and not our Customers.\nTo exercise your rights with respect to information processed by us on behalf of one of our Customers, please read the privacy policy of our Customer.\n</p>\n<p> In this section, we first describe your privacy rights and then we explain how you can exercise those rights.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Please note:</strong> with respect to data stored in our Service, there are significant limitations on our ability to respond to requests to exercise these rights.\nThese limitations relate to our ability to verify your identity.\n</p>\n<p> In part to protect your privacy, we purposefully collect only \u201ccoarse\u201d level information associated with your IP Address.\nFor example, we collect your ZIP or postal code, but we do not have your street address.\nIt is this lack of identifying information that presents a challenge in verifying your identity for purposes of exercising your rights.\nWe need to reliably verify your identity to prevent malicious or fraudulent attempts to alter or delete data in our Service.\n</p>\n<p> We must rely on your IP Address to verify your identity.\nWe will automatically detect your IP Address when you make a request to exercise any of the rights below.\nIf you would like us to reveal, edit, delete or otherwise manipulate our stored data associated with an IP Address that does not match the one you are contacting us from, we will need to take additional steps to verify your identity.\nThis may include requiring you to acquire an attestation from your Internet Service Provider.\nThis is particularly likely to be true if you are seeking to exercise rights regarding a dynamic IP Address, as opposed to a static one.\n</p> Right to Know What Happens to Your Personal Data <p> This is called the \u201cright to be informed\u201d.\nIt means that you have the right to obtain from us all information regarding our data processing activities that concern you such as how we collect and use your Personal Data, how long we will keep it and who it will be shared with, among other things.\n</p>\n<p> We are informing you of how we process your Personal Data with this Notice.\n</p>\n<p>

allows you to ask for full details of the Personal Data we have about you.\n</p>\n<p> You have the right to obtain from us confirmation as to whether or not we process Personal Data concerning you, and, where that is the case, a copy of or access to the Personal Data and certain related information.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Used In The Service:</strong> With respect to the Personal Data processed as part of the Service, you can access and view the information we collect at any time at this demo feature.\nPlease see the Section \u201cHow Can You Exercise Your Privacy Rights,\u201d

22(1) and (4) of the GDPR meaningful information about the logic </li>involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for you.\n<li>The specific pieces of

disclosing: <ul>\n<li>sales, identifying the Personal Data categories that each category of recipient purchased.\nand</li>disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the Personal Data categories

third party;</li>\n<li>The appropriate safeguards for transferring your Personal Data from the EU to a third country, if applicable.</li>\n</ul> Please take into account that the GDPR allows us not to

information is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing.\nand</li>\n<li>That Personal Data must remain confidential subject to an obligation of professional secrecy regulated by Union or Member State law, including a statutory obligation of secrecy.</li>\n</ul> Please know that the CCPA does not allow us to disclose Social Security

it directly, please follow the steps described below and we will do our best to change the Personal Data for you.\n</p> Right to Delete Your Personal Data <p> This is called the right to erasure, right to deletion or the \"right to be forgotten\".\nThis right means you can ask for your Personal Data to be deleted.\n</p>\n<p> Sometimes we can delete your information, but other times it is just not possible, like when the law tells us we cannot do that.\nIf that's the case, we will consider if we can limit how we use it.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Occasions Where We Cannot Fulfil a Deletion Request Under the GDPR or the CCPA: The GDPR and the CCPA</strong> allow us to deny a request to erase your Personal Data if we or our service providers need to retain the Personal Data to: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Data;</li>\n<li>Fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law;</li>\n<li>Provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract

right provided for by law.</li>\n<li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, provided that you previously provided informed consent;</li>\n<li>Enable solely internal uses reasonably aligned with your expectations based on your relationship with us;</li>\n<li>Comply with a legal obligation, including (but not limited to) obligations from the California

\u201cright to object\u201d.\nThis is your right to tell us to stop using your Personal Data.\nYou have this right where we rely on a legitimate interest of ours (or of a third party) to support our processing of your Personal Data, as we do in this Privacy Policy.\nAlso, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes.\n</p>\n<p> We will stop processing the relevant Personal Data unless: (i) we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights, or freedoms.\nor (ii) we need to continue processing your Personal Data to establish, exercise, or defend a legal claim.\n</p> Right to Port or Move Your Personal Data <p> This is called the \u201cright to data portability\u201d.\nIt's the right to ask for and download Personal Data about you that you have given us or that you have generated by virtue of the use of our Services, so that you can: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Move it;</li>\n<li>Copy it;</li>\n<li>Keep it for yourself.\nor</li>\n<li>Transfer it to another organization.</li>\n</ul> We will provide your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.\nWhen you request electronically to know what data we have about you, we will provide you with a copy of your Personal Data in electronic format.\n<p>\n</p> Right Related to Automated Decision Making <p> We sometimes use computers to study your Personal Data.\nWe might use this Personal Data so we know how you use our services.\nFor decisions that may seriously impact you, you have \"the right not to be

penalties;</li>\n<li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.\nor</li>\n<li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or

obtain an attestation from your Internet Service Provider that you own or use the IP Address you are contacting us about.\n</p> Authorized Agents <p> Data Collected Via Website or Customers: You may appoint an authorized agent to exercise your rights on your behalf.\nYou should appoint such agent via written permission or a power of attorney pursuant to Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465 (if you

information, including certain Personal Data.\nWe will only use the Personal Data you provide us in a request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.\n</p>\n<p> Please note that you may only make a consumer request to know or data portability twice within a 12-month period.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Used in the Service:</strong> As discussed above, we will verify

response to that account.\nIf you do not have an account with us, we will send our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.\n</p>\n<p> Consider that we will only cover the

90 days from the receipt of your request.\n</p>\n<p> If we cannot satisfy a request, we will also explain why in our response.\nFor data portability requests, we will choose a format to provide your Personal Data that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without difficulty.\n</p>\n<p> We promise we will not charge a fee for processing or responding to your requests.\nExceptionally, we may charge a fee if we determine that your request is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.\nIn those cases, we will tell you
