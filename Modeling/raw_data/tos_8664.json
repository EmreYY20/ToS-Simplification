and Security Policy\nPrivacy\n<p>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) complies with requirements for privacy and security established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\nThis page outlines our privacy and security policy as they apply to our sites as well as third party sites and applications that NLM uses (for example, Facebook and YouTube).</p>\nYour Visit to the NLM Websites\n<p>Your visit to the NLM websites is private and secure.\nWhen you visit the NLM websites, we do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) about you, unless you choose to explicitly provide it to us.\nWe do, however, collect some data about your visit to our website to help us better understand public use of the site and to make it more useful to visitors.\nThis page describes the information that is automatically collected and stored.\nNLM never collects information for commercial marketing or any purpose not related to&nbsp;NLM's functions.</p>\nWhat Type of Information NLM Collects\n<p>When you visit any website, certain information about your visit can be collected.\nNLM automatically collects and stores the following type of information about your visit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The name of the domain you use to access the Internet (for example, verizon.com, if you are using a Verizon online account, or stanford.edu, if you are connecting from Stanford University's domain)</li>\n<li>The date and time of your visit to our website</li>\n<li>The pages and documents you viewed on our website from an external search engine such as Bing or Google</li>\n<li>The URL of the website you visited prior to ours</li>\n<li>The words you searched for on our website</li>\n<li>The type and version of your Web browser and operating system, and</li>\n<li>Your location at the time of your visit, down to the city-level</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This information is used to measure the number of visitors to the various sections of our site and improve organization, coverage, system performance or other problem areas.\nThis information is not used for associating search terms or patterns of site navigation with individual users.\nWhen search features offer suggested terms, these suggestions are based on aggregated data only.\nNLM periodically deletes its web logs.\nOn occasion, NLM may provide aggregated information to third party entities it contracts with for the purposes of research analysis.\nAggregated data cannot be linked back to an individual user.</p>\n<p>If your electronic medical record (EMR), patient health record (PHR) or other system links you to MedlinePlus, your diagnosis codes or other information, such as medications or procedures names, are sent to our site in order to link you to the most appropriate information.\nNo personally identifiable information is collected in this process.</p>\nHow NLM Uses Cookies\n<p>When you visit any web site, it may place a small text file, known as a \"cookie,\" on your computer.\nThe cookie allows the website to \"remember\" specific information about your visit while you are connected or when you return to that site.\nThe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memo&nbsp;M-10-22, Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies&nbsp;allows Federal agencies to use session and persistent cookies.</p>\n<p>The cookie makes it easier for you to use the dynamic features of web pages.\nCookies from NLM web pages only collect information about your browser's visit to the site.\nthey do not collect personal information about you.\nWhile visiting certain NLM websites, you may occasionally encounter a web page that automatically employs cookies to make it easier to use the web page\u2019s dynamic features.</p>\n<p>NLM websites may use either single session (temporary) or multi-session (persistent) cookies.\nSession cookies last only as long as your web browser is open.\nOnce you close your browser, the cookie disappears.\nPersistent cookies are stored on your computer for longer periods.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Session Cookies:</strong> We use session cookies for technical purposes such as to enable better navigation through our site.\nThe OMB Memo 10-22 Guidance defines our use of session cookies as \"Usage Tier 1 \u2013 Single Session.\" This tier encompasses any use of single session web measurement and customization technologies.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Persistent Cookies:</strong> We use persistent cookies to enhance the web experience for our users.\nPersistent cookies remain on your computer between visits to NLM until they expire.\nThe OMB Memo 10-22 Guidance defines our use of persistent cookies as \"Usage Tier 2 \u2013 Multi-session without Personally Identifiable Information (PII).\" This tier encompasses any use of multi-session web measurement and customization technologies when no PII is collected.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, NLM uses persistent cookies to enable PubMed\u2019s My NCBI feature.\nThe persistent cookie retains user preferences such as search result filters, LinkOut displays, institutional icon links, document delivery services, etc.\nacross user sessions.\nUsers may opt out of the persistent cookie selection in their My NCBI settings at any time.\nNLM also uses persistent cookies to avoid repeated invitations to&nbsp;take our ForeSee customer satisfaction survey.\nThe persistent cookies that block repeated survey invitations expire in 90 days.\nNLM may employ persistent cookies in other ways consistent with our mission and the OMB guidelines to analyze use patterns and improve our users' experience on NLM websites.</p>\nHow to Opt Out or Disable Cookies\n<p>If you do not wish to have session or persistent cookies placed on your computer, you can disable them at any time from your web browser.\nIf you opt out of cookies, you will still have access to all information and resources at NLM, but you may not be able to use cookie-dependent features.</p>\n<p>See USA.gov\u2019s Web Measurement and Customization Opt-Out page for instructions on disabling or opting out of cookies in the most popular browsers.\n&nbsp;Please note when you disable cookies from your web browser, you will disable cookies from all sources, not just those from NLM.</p>\nPersonally Identifiable Information (PII)\n<p>You do not have to give us personal information to visit the NLM website.</p>\n<p>If you choose to send us personal information by email, or by filling out a form on our web site, we use this information to respond to your message and to help us provide you with the information or material you requested.\nIf provided, personally identifiable information is maintained in a database that is regularly purged after 410 days.</p>\n<p>Third-party contractors employed by NLM may have access to this information in order to provide a response to your question or comment.\nThese contractors are held to strict policies to safeguard the information and provide the same level of privacy protection as guaranteed by NLM.</p>\n<p>On occasion, we may conduct a study concerning the types of questions sent to us.\nThese studies help us to improve our websites in order to make them more responsive to the needs of our users.</p>\nDisclosure\n<p>NLM does not give, share, sell, or transfer any personal information about our visitors, unless required by law enforcement or statute.</p>\n<p>For further information about the NIH privacy policy, please contact the NIH Senior Official listed below, or visit
