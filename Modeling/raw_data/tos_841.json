owner, I believe it is important and helpful to know my audience, understand where they come from, what they are reading and how much time they spend on my website.</p>\n<p>However, like many people nowadays, I do not like being tracked on the Internet.\nBig Internet companies collect your personal data across millions of websites, some of which you visit everyday.\nWith this data, they build a precise profile of who you are, what your interests are, what you buy, what you believe in\u2026 They use these profiles to provide advertisement or search results that is more relevant to you.\nOr sell these to third-parties.</p>\n<p>As an individual, I am strongly against theses privacy-invasive practices, and I make sure to use tools to protect my privacy, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DuckDuckGo as my search engine.</li>\n<li>uBlock Origin, as an privacy safeguard (blocks ads, tracking scripts, malware programs\u2026).\nIt\u2019s free, open source and works on all browsers.</li>\n<li>Firefox, as my main browser.\nIt\u2019s free, open source, and more privacy oriented than closed source browsers like Google Chrome.</li>\n<li>Quad9, as my DNS provider.\nToo many people use Google\u2019s 8.8.8.8 DNS service\u2026 which is another way for Google to know the websites you visit.</li>\n</ul>Does SpaceOddities.eu track you?<p>\n<strong>Yes</strong>.\nThis website uses a tracking tool called Matomo (formerly known as Piwik).\nIt is an open-source software that provide website analytics for this blog.\nI selected this tool because it is privacy oriented, unlike Google Analytics and similar software.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>However </strong>(and that\u2019s very important to me!):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Matomo runs locally</strong>, which means that all the data is hosted and stored on my server only.\n<strong>It is not shared with third-parties</strong>.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Your IP address is stored and used anonymously</strong>: only the first 3 bytes are visible, e.g.\n123.45.67.XXX.\nThis allows me to know the country of origin of my visitors.</li>\n<li>Matomo does not track you if you activated the <strong>Do Not Track</strong> option of your browser.\nI respect your wish not to be tracked.\nYou\u2019re the boss!</li>\n</ul>How to delete my data?<p>If you don\u2019t want SpaceOddities.eu to track you, you can activate&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>Do Not Track</strong>&nbsp;option in your browser.\nAdditionally, you can delete any data gathered by SpaceOddities.eu with this formular:</p>\n<p>\n</p>Third-party tools<p>Generally speaking, I do not use any third-party script that could&nbsp;<em>in fine</em>&nbsp;track you through SpaceOddities.eu.</p>\n<p>One exception: the comments posted on this website are processed by Akismet antispam solution.\nThis tool prevents bots from spamming this website.&nbsp;You can review Akismet\u2019s privacy policy here.</p>\n<p>If you have any question, please contact me!</p>", "created_at":
