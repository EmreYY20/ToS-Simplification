mind before you decide to terminate your account.\nWe will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account so that you are able to retrieve any important User Submissions you may have stored in your account (to the extent allowed by law and these Terms), but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone\u2019s safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the rights or property of Woebot.</p>\n<p>If you have deleted your account by mistake, contact us immediately via our&nbsp;Help Center&nbsp;\u2013 we will try to
