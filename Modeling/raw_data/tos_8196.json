how we collect, use and safeguard your information when you use our websites, software and services (\"Service\").\nIt describes the sources of personal information we may collect about you, the purposes for which we use information, the circumstances in which we may share information, and the steps that we take to safeguard information to protect your privacy.\n</p>\n<p> There are three categories of data which we store: basic data, general data, and usage data.\n</p> Basic Data <p> We collect, and associate with your account, information like your name, email address, phone number, payment details, and physical address.\nWe use this information to deliver StayPrivate, to bill for your use of StayPrivate, and also to allow us to communicate directly with you.\nWe do not, outside of specific exceptions described below, share this information with third parties.\n</p>\n<p> We may disclose your personal information to fulfil your instructions, to protect our rights and interests or pursuant to your express consent.\nUnder limited circumstances, your personal information may be disclosed to third parties under our Privacy Policy and as permitted by, or to comply with, applicable laws and regulations, for instance, to protect against fraud or to co-operate with law enforcement or regulatory authorities.\n</p> General Data <p> When you use StayPrivate, we store, process and transmit your files and information (including emails, messages, documents and photos) and information related to them (for example, time of last change).\nOther than the restricted rights described in our Privacy Policy, we do not have access nor any other rights to this data.\nAll communication remains your property and is encrypted both in transfer and in storage.\n</p> Usage Data <p> We collect information from and about the devices you use to access StayPrivate.\nThis includes things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use and identifiers associated with your devices.\nThis information is only used to help us keep your StayPrivate secure and we do not share it with anyone other than yourself.\n</p> Cookies and Similar Technologies <p> We occasionally use cookies and similar technologies (such as HTML5 local storage) to provide, improve and protect our Services.\nFor example, cookies can be used to remember your username for your next visit.\n</p>\n<p> You can set your browser to not accept cookies, and this should not make any difference to your ability to use StayPrivate.\nThe Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether.\nTo learn more about what cookies are set on your computer as you browse the web and how to manage or delete them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.\n</p> Outsourcing <p> StayPrivate uses certain trusted third parties to help us provide and protect StayPrivate.\nUnencrypted information is not available to any third parties.\nAnd third parties may access your information only to perform tasks on our behalf and only in compliance with this Privacy Policy.\n</p> organizations That Can Access Your Data <p> If you use StayPrivate as an employee, agent, client, potential client, or similar, of an organization, that organization may be able to access the data you provide to StayPrivate.\n</p> Compliance Exception <p> As described in our Privacy Policy, we may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with the law.\n(b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury.\n(c) prevent fraud or abuse of StayPrivate or our users.\nor (d) protect StayPrivate\u2019s property rights.\n</p> Security <p> We have a team dedicated to keeping your information secure and testing for vulnerabilities.\nWe also continue to work on features to keep your information safe.\n</p>\n<p> StayPrivate is committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of your personal information.\nWe limit access to your personal information as much as possible and, as described above, providers are held to stringent standards of privacy.\nWe also maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect information against loss, misuse, damage or modification and unauthorized access or disclosure.\n</p> Retention <p> We will retain information you store on StayPrivate for as long as we need it to provide you StayPrivate.\nIf you delete your account, we will also delete this information.\nBut please note: (1) there might be some latency in deleting this information from our servers and back-up storage.\nand (2) we may retain this information if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.\n</p>\n<p> If your relationship with StayPrivate ends and we retain any of your personal information we will continue to treat it as described in this policy.\n</p> Locations <p> Depending on your choice of location, we store all your information within secure data centres in one of either the United Kingdom, the United States or the European Union (Germany).\nHowever, you may access StayPrivate from anywhere in the world and information may be stored on the devices you use to access StayPrivate.\n</p> Government Access Rights <p> StayPrivate believes that individuals have the right to know who can access their data and what terms.\nWe also believe that this should apply to governments and companies alike.\n</p>\n<p> StayPrivate will only release information to governments or other authorities on the presentation of a valid search warrant issued under due legal process.\nSuch a warrant should show probable cause in order to justify the disclosure of the stored contents and communication of any account.\n</p>\n<p> It is our policy to notify users and provide them with a copy of any civil or government legal process regarding their account (including formal requests for private information), unless we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so.\nIf that is the case, we will notify users and provide them with a copy of the legal process when the prohibition expires.\n</p>\n<p> If a request for information is valid, we will preserve the necessary information before informing the user.\nIn most cases, upon notification to the user, that user will be provided with either 7 days or the amount of time before the information is due, whichever is later, during which time the user may legally challenge the request.\nIf, prior to the deadline, we receive notice that the user intends to challenge a request, no information will be delivered until that process concludes.\nWe also review information requests and may lodge our own challenge to the scope or validity of legal process received, on behalf of a user, whether or not the user pursues their own legal challenge.\n</p>\n<p> StayPrivate is not designed to enable surveillance of users.\nIn order to deliver StayPrivate, we may use third parties.\nIf such a third party has access to data about our customers this would normally be anonymised.\nNevertheless we expect all third parties to handle all data as StayPrivate would, meaning that they should not share the information with any other company or individual, use it any way other than to deliver the necessary service, nor assist governments in widespread surveillance of users.\n</p>\n<p> StayPrivate is a UK-based company and adheres to UK privacy laws and standards.\nIf it were to receive a National Security Letter (NSL) or its equivalent originating from the US government, and was advised that this letter was legally applicable in the UK, it would notify the US government that it would like the court to review the non-disclosure provision of the NSL pursuant to USA Freedom.\nThe US government would have 30 days to let the court know why the non-disclosure should remain in effect.\nIf we receive notice that the non-disclosure no longer applies, we will notify the affected customer.\n</p> Changes <p> If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition or sale of our assets, the way your information is managed may change as part of that deal.\nWe will notify you (for example, via a message to the email address associated with your account) of any such deal and outline your choices in that event.\n</p>\n<p> We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will post the most current version on our website.\nIf a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you.\n</p> Contact <p> If you have questions or concerns about StayPrivate and privacy, contact us at privacy@stayprivate.com.\n</p> Compliance Policy Effective: 18th September 2022 Privacy Framework <p> StayPrivate respects all organizations' and individuals' rights to privacy, however, StayPrivate respects the law foremost and also recognizes that organizations and individuals only retain their rights to privacy while they are not seriously disrespecting the rights of others.\nStayPrivate will resist any unlawful requests from governments and other third parties to access your data.\n</p>\n<p> Although the StayPrivate Software is able to access your data and information because it needs to in order to be able to deliver its Service to Clients and to allow Clients to access their own information, you can have total confidence that, in the normal course of events, StayPrivate itself will not access your information.\nStayPrivate operates 'Chinese walls' within its organization so that no individual employee has sufficient access to the various encryption keys, programs and databases to be able to circumvent our controls and access any Client data.\n</p> Acceptable Use Effective: 18th September 2022 <p> StayPrivate is used by many organizations and individuals around the world, and we appreciate the trust you have placed and continue to place in us to protect your information.\nIn return, we trust you to use StayPrivate responsibly.\n</p>\n<p> You agree not to misuse the StayPrivate (\"Service\").\nFor example, you must not, and must not attempt to do the following: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network.\n</li>\n<li> breach or otherwise circumvent any security or authentication measures.\n</li>\n<li> access, tamper with, or use non-public areas or parts of StayPrivate, or shared areas of StayPrivate you have not been invited to.\n</li>\n<li> interfere with or disrupt any user, host, or network, for example by sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, or mail-bombing any part of StayPrivate.\n</li>\n<li>

phishing.\n</li>\n<li> promote or advertise products or services other than your own without appropriate authorization.\n</li>\n<li> abuse StayPrivate in a manner that circumvents storage space limits.\n</li>\n<li> sell StayPrivate accounts via unauthorized channels.\n</li>\n<li> impersonate or misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity.\n</li>\n<li> use automated or other means to create accounts in bulk or to access StayPrivate other than by using our official interface and/or apps.\n</li>\n<li> store or share materials that are unlawfully pornographic or indecent, or that advocate bigotry, religious, racial or ethnic hatred.\n</li>\n<li> violate the law in any way including storing, publishing or sharing material that is fraudulent, defamatory, misleading, or that violates the privacy or infringes the rights of others.\n</li>\n</ul> Company About<br> Contact Us<br> Blog<br> Terms of Service<br> Product Pricing<br> How StayPrivate Works<br> How We Stop

third parties.\n</p>\n<p> We may disclose your personal information to fulfil your instructions, to protect our rights and interests or pursuant to your express consent.\nUnder limited circumstances,

or to co-operate with law enforcement or regulatory authorities.\n</p> General Data <p> When you use StayPrivateMail, we store, process and transmit your files and information (including emails,

to help us if you request StayPrivateMail to remember your username for your next visit.\n</p>\n<p> You can set your browser to not accept cookies, and this should not make any difference to your ability to use StayPrivateMail.\nThe Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether.\nTo learn more about what cookies are set on your computer as you browse the web and how to manage or delete them, visit

tasks on our behalf and only in compliance with this Privacy Policy.\n</p> Organisations That Can Access Your Data <p> If you use StayPrivateMail as an employee, agent, client, potential client, or similar, of an organisation, that organisation may be able to access the data you provide to StayPrivateMail.\n</p> Compliance Exception <p> As described in our Compliance Policy, we may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with the law.\n(b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury.\n(c) prevent fraud or abuse of StayPrivateMail or our users.\nor (d) protect StayPrivate\u2019s property rights.\n</p> Security <p> We have a team dedicated to keeping your information secure and testing for vulnerabilities.\nWe also continue to work on features to keep your information safe in addition to features such as two-factor authentication, encryption of files at rest, and alerts when new devices and apps are linked to your account.\n</p>\n<p> StayPrivate is committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of your personal information.\nWe limit access to your personal information as much as possible and, as described above, providers are held to stringent standards of privacy.\nWe also maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect information against loss, misuse, damage or modification and unauthorised access or disclosure.\n</p> Retention <p> We will retain information you store on StayPrivateMail for as long as we need it to provide you StayPrivateMail.\nIf you delete your account, we will also delete this information.\nBut please note: (1) there might be some latency in deleting this information from our servers and back-up storage.\nand (2) we may retain this information if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.\n</p>\n<p> If your relationship with StayPrivate ends and we retain any of your personal information we will continue to treat it as described in this policy.\n</p> Locations <p> We store all your information within the European Union.\nOur servers operate from secure data centres across the UK.\nHowever, you may access StayPrivateMail from anywhere in the world and information may be stored on the devices you use to access StayPrivateMail.\n</p> Government Access Rights <p> StayPrivate believes that individuals have the right to know who can access their data and what terms.\nWe also believe that this should apply to governments and companies alike.\n</p>\n<p> StayPrivate will only release information to governments or other authorities on the presentation of a valid search warrant issued under due legal process.\nSuch a warrant should show probable cause in order to justify the disclosure of the stored contents and communication of any account.\n</p>\n<p> It is our policy to notify users and provide them with a copy of any civil or government legal process regarding their account (including formal requests for private information), unless we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so.\nIf that is the case, we will notify users and provide them with a copy of the legal process when the prohibition expires.\n</p>\n<p> If a request for information is valid, we will preserve the necessary information before informing the user.\nIn most cases, upon notification to the user, that user will be provided with either 7 days or the amount of time before the information is due, whichever is later, during which time the user may legally challenge the request.\nIf, prior to the deadline, we receive notice that the user intends to challenge a request, no information will be delivered until that process concludes.\nWe also review information requests and may lodge our own challenge to the scope or validity of legal process received, on behalf of a user, whether or not the user pursues their own legal challenge.\n</p>\n<p> StayPrivateMail is not designed to enable surveillance of users.\nIn order to deliver StayPrivateMail, we may use third parties.\nIf such a third party has access to data about our customers this would normally be anonymised.\nNevertheless we expect all third parties to handle all data as StayPrivate would, meaning that they should not share the information with any other company or individual, use it any way other than to deliver the necessary service, nor assist governments in widespread surveillance of users.\n</p>\n<p> StayPrivate is a UK-based company and adheres to European Union privacy laws and standards.\nIf it were to receive a National Security Letter (NSL) or its equivalent originating from the US government, and was advised that this letter was legally applicable in the UK, it would notify the US government that it would like the court to review the non-disclosure provision of the NSL pursuant to USA FREEDOM.\nThe US government would have 30 days to let the court know why the non-disclosure should remain in effect.\nIf we receive notice that the non-disclosure no longer applies, we will notify the affected customer.\n</p> Changes <p> If we are involved in a reorganisation, merger, acquisition or sale of our assets, the way your information is managed may change as part of that deal.\nWe will notify you (for example, via a message to the email address associated with your account) of any such deal and outline your choices in that event.\n</p>\n<p> We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will post the most current version on our website.\nIf a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you.\n</p> Contact <p> If you have questions or concerns about StayPrivate and privacy, contact us at privacy@stayprivate.com.\n</p> COMPLIANCE POLICY Effective: 2nd January 2019 Privacy Framework <p> StayPrivate respects all organisations' and individuals' rights to privacy, however, StayPrivate respects the law foremost and also recognises that organisations and individuals only retain their rights to privacy while they are not seriously disrespecting the rights of others.\nStayPrivate will resist any unlawful requests from governments and other third parties to access your data.\nStayPrivate's annual Compliance and Transparency Report contains a section summarising all requests for information received and whether information was provided.\n</p>\n<p> Although StayPrivate, as a whole, is able to access your data and information because it needs to in order to be able to deliver its Service to Clients and to allow Clients to access their own information, StayPrivate\u2019s clients should have total confidence that, in the normal course of events, StayPrivate will not access your information.\nStayPrivate operates Chinese walls within its organisation so that no individual has sufficient access to the various encryption keys and database to be able to circumvent our controls and access any Client data.\n</p> Compliance Oversight <p> StayPrivate accepts no responsibility for the actions of any of its Clients.\nHowever, at its discretion, and where it believes that it can do so without compromising users\u2019 rights to privacy, StayPrivate does adopt processes designed to uncover seriously unacceptable behaviour, for example, child abuse.\nThe StayPrivate Compliance Team, subject to Senior Management approval, can run certain automated scripts over the StayPrivate client database.\nThese scripts are carefully targeted and designed to uncover specific types of seriously unacceptable behaviour, and the results are entirely anonymised.\nIf the StayPrivate Compliance Team uncovers evidence of what it believes is seriously unacceptable behaviour then, subject to Senior Management approval, it may be allowed further access in order to gather further evidence.\nIf the outcome of its further investigations provides strong evidence of seriously unacceptable behaviour then, subject to Senior Management approval, the StayPrivate Compliance team may be able to gain full read access to individual Client accounts.\nIf it uncovers criminal activity, the StayPrivate Compliance team, at its discretion, may share such information with the relevant authorities.\n</p>\n<p> StayPrivate accepts no responsibility for the failure of its Compliance Team to uncover seriously unacceptable behaviour.\n</p> Annual Compliance and Transparency Report <p> StayPrivate\u2019s Annual Compliance and Transparency Report was first published in December 2017.\nThe report contains a summary of all the various activities of the StayPrivate Compliance Team as well as all government information access requests.\n</p> ACCEPTABLE USE
