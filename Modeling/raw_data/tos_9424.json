Moonpig.</p>\n<p>Where Moonpig transfers your personal data outside the EEA, we make sure that there are rules in place to protect your data.\nThis means that Moonpig either has contractual clauses approved by the European Commission in our contracts with parties outside the EEA, or Moonpig will rely on European Commission adequacy decisions.<b>&nbsp;</b>\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<b>8.\nYour rights</b>\n<p>You have personal data rights.\nThese are the right to:</p>\n<p>\n<b>Request access </b>to your personal data (commonly known as a \"data subject access request\").\nThis enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Request correction </b>of the personal data that we hold about you.\nThis enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Request erasure </b>of your personal data.\nThis enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process, when you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.\nNote, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request for erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, when you make your request.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>Object to processing </b>of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.\nYou also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.\nIn some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Request restriction of processing </b>of your personal data.\nThis enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Where our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>Request the transfer </b>of your personal data to you or to a third party.\nWe will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.\nNote that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>Withdraw consent at any time </b>where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.\nHowever, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.\nIf you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.\nWe will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>\n<b>No fee usually required</b>\n<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).\nHowever, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive.\nAlternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>\n<b>What we may need from you</b>\n<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights).\nThis is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.\nWe may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>\n<b>Time limit to respond</b>\n<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.\nOccasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made several requests.\nIn this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.&nbsp;</p>\n<b>9.\nContacting us</b>\n<p>We have appointed a data protection officer (DPO) who is responsible for overseeing questions in relation to this privacy policy.\nIf you have any questions about this privacy policy, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, please contact the DPO using the details set out below.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>Moonpig.com

be entitled to compensation.\nThe reasons are:</p>\n<p>(a) We have told you about an upcoming change to the product or these Terms which you do not agree to (see section \u200e7.2);</p>\n<p>(b) we have told you about an error in the price or description of the product you have ordered and you do not wish to proceed;</p>\n<p>(c)&nbsp;there is a risk that supply of the products may be significantly delayed because of events outside our control;</p>\n<p>(d)&nbsp;we have suspended supply of the products for technical reasons, or notify you we are going to suspend them for technical reasons, in each case for a period of more than 48 hours.\nor</p>\n<p>(e)&nbsp;you have a legal right to end the contract because of something we have done wrong.</p>\n<p>8.3&nbsp;<b>Exercising your right to change your mind (Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013)</b>\n</p>\n<p>For most products bought online you have a legal right to change your mind within 14&nbsp;days and receive a refund.</p>\n<p>How long you have depends on what you have ordered and how it is delivered:</p>\n<p>(a)&nbsp;<b>Have you bought digital content for download (for example, an eCard)?</b> if so, you have 14 days after the day we email you to confirm we accept your order, or, if earlier, until the email containing the eCard has been opened.\nIf we delivered the digital content to you immediately, and you agreed to this when ordering, you will not have a right to change your mind.</p>\n<p>(b)&nbsp;<b>Have you bought goods (for example, a Non-Personalised Product)?</b> if so\nyou have 14 days after the day you (or the recipient) receives the goods, unless your goods are split into several deliveries over different days.\nIn this case you have until 14 days after the day you (or the recipient) receives the last delivery to change your mind about the goods.\n</p>\n<p>8.4&nbsp;<b>When you don't have the right to change your mind</b>\n</p>\n<p>You do not have a right to change your mind in respect of </p>\n<p>(a) Personalised Products.\n</p>\n<p>(b)&nbsp;digital products such as eCards after the recipient has opened the email containing the eCard.\n</p>\n<p>(c)&nbsp;products which are sealed for health protection or hygiene purposes, once these have been unsealed after you receive them.\n</p>\n<p>(d)&nbsp;perishable goods, such as food, drink and flowers, which deteriorate rapidly.\nand </p>\n<p>(e)&nbsp;services, once these have been completed, even if the cancellation period is still running.\n</p>\n<p>8.5 <b>Ending the contract where we are not at fault and there is no right to change your mind</b>\n</p>\n<p>Even if we are not at fault and you do not have a right to change your mind (see clause 8.1) you can still end the contract before it is completed, but you may have to pay us compensation.\nA contract for goods or digital content is completed when the product is delivered, downloaded or streamed and paid for.\n&nbsp;If you want to end a contract before it is completed where we are not at fault and you have not changed your mind, just contact us to let us know.\nThe contract will end immediately and we will refund any sums paid by you for products not provided but we may deduct from that refund reasonable compensation for the net costs we will incur as a result of your ending the contract.</p>\n<p>8.6&nbsp;<b>Summary of your

to return your item.</p>\n<p>We offer 5 days of freshness guarantee for flowers.\nPlease note, because flowers are perishable, we need to be informed of any problem with your order within five days of delivery to give us the best chance of resolving the issue.\nWe reserve the right to refuse a refund or replacement.</p>\n<p>If you receive a product from us in error, you must inform our Customer Service Team immediately.\nOur Customer Service Team will then provide you with instructions on how to return or securely destroy the product.\n</p>\n<p>9.2&nbsp;<b>Your legal obligation to return rejected products</b>\n</p>\n<p>If you wish to exercise your legal rights to reject products you must return them back to us.\nIf you have ordered a gift, please return the product to the return

cases.</p>\n<p>Where an item is faulty, &nbsp;please contact our Customer Service Team via Webchat.\nWe will either ask you to return the item to us within three days of receipt or to take a photo of the item before returning it back to us.\nYou can speak to our Customer Service Team for a Freepost returns address if you do not have one.\nYour right to return items to us in accordance with these Terms is in addition to any other statutory rights you may have.</p>\n<p>If you are eligible for a refund, we will reimburse the price you have paid for the product(s) onto the credit or debit card that you paid with or to your PayPal account.\nAlternatively, we may offer to reprint (if applicable) and resend the item free of charge.\nPlease note it is not our policy to offer both a refund <i>and</i> a resend.</p>\n<p>Refunds cannot be given if the fault is a result of your own actions such as product misuse or if personalisation is mis-spelt or if you have uploaded an image of a low resolution or size.\nPlease see section \u200e3.3 on Personalised Products for more information.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Flowers</b>\n</p>\n<p>If the recipient receives damaged flowers or they fail to arrive, please contact us immediately so that we can arrange to resend the flowers on the next available delivery date or offer a full or partial refund.\nThe amount of partial refund will depend on the specific circumstances surrounding the flowers.</p>\n<p>As is the case with other gifts, it is not our policy to offer both a refund and a resend.\nWhere flowers have been damaged we will normally ask for photographs clearly showing the problem so we can use them to determine what is going wrong with our system or our couriers.\nRefunds cannot be given for flowers that have died quickly, unless we understand there to be a genuine problem.\nIt is important that flowers are cared for correctly and in line with the instructions provided.\nPutting them by heat sources or draughts, or failing to change the water will damage them.\nWe include instructions and flower-food with all our arrangements.\nAll flowers should normally last five days or longer, although this varies by variety.\nIn some circumstances, flowers are sent in bud and will not be fully open when they arrive.\nHowever, they should open once they have settled at room temperature.</p>\n<p>It is important that we are contacted as soon as possible regarding issues with your order or the product(s) you have ordered.\nWe need to be informed of any issues within three days of the delivery to give us the best chance of

via Webchat.\nWe will either ask you to return the item to us within three days of receipt or to take a photo of the item before returning it back to us.\nYou can speak to our Customer Service Team for a Freepost returns address if you do not have one.\nYour right to return items to us in accordance with these Terms is in addition to any other statutory rights you may have.</p>\n<p>If you are eligible for a refund, we will reimburse the price you have paid for the product(s) onto the credit or debit card that you paid with or to your PayPal account.\nAlternatively, we may offer to reprint (if applicable) and resend the item free of charge.\nPlease note it is not our policy to offer both a refund <i>and</i> a resend.</p>\n<p>Please note that if the value of the product has been reduced by any handling of it beyond what is necessary to check whether the product is as expected, we may deduct an amount to reflect that reduction in value from the sum we refund to you.\nNote that the value of a product may be reduced to nothing if its seal (or similar) is broken.\n</p>\n<p>9.4&nbsp;<b>When we will pay the costs of return</b>\n</p>\n<p>We will pay the costs of return if: </p>\n<p>(a)&nbsp;the products are faulty or misdescribed.\n</p>\n<p>(b) if you are ending the contract because we have told you of an upcoming change to the product or these terms, an error in pricing or description, a delay in delivery due to events outside our control or because you have a legal right to do so as a result of something we have done wrong;</p>\n<p>(c) if we, or on behalf of our suppliers, have requested a return of the product due to a product recall.</p>\n<p>9.5<b> Deductions from refunds if you are exercising your right to change your mind</b>\n</p>\n<p>We may reduce your refund of the price (excluding delivery costs) to reflect any reduction in the value of the goods, if this has been caused by your handling them in a way which would not be permitted in a shop.\nIf we refund you the price paid before we are able to inspect the goods and later discover you have handled them in an unacceptable way, you must pay us an appropriate amount.</p>\n<p>The maximum refund for delivery costs will be the costs of delivery by the least expensive delivery method we offer.\nFor example, if we offer delivery of a product within 3-5 days at one cost but you choose to have the product delivered within 24 hours at a higher cost, then we will only refund what you would have paid for the cheaper delivery option.</p>\n<p>10 <b>OUR RIGHTS TO END THE CONTRACT</b>\n</p>\n<p>10.1 <b>We may end the contract if you break it</b>\n</p>\n<p>We may end the contract for a product at any time by writing to you if:</p>\n<p>(a)&nbsp;you do not, within a reasonable time, allow us to deliver the products to you or the recipient or collect them from us/your local depot.\n</p>\n<p>10.2&nbsp;<b>You must compensate us if you break the
