real-time social platform and work tool that provides fast and fun ways to express yourself, communicate with others and have fun together!</p>\n<p>When you use these services, you\u2019ll share some information with us.\nSo we want to be upfront about the information we collect, how we use it, whom we share it with, and the controls we give you to access, update, and delete your information.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why we\u2019ve written this Privacy Policy.\nAnd it\u2019s why we\u2019ve tried to write it in a way that\u2019s blissfully free of the legalese that often clouds these documents.\nOf course, if you still have questions about anything in our Privacy Policy, just contact us at weare @ here.fm</p>Information We Collect<p>There are three basic categories of information we collect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Information you provide.</li>\n<li>Information we get when you use our services.</li>\n<li>Information we get from third parties.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here\u2019s a little more detail on each of these categories.</p>Information You Provide<p>When you interact with our services, we collect information that you provide to us.\nFor example, most of our services require you to set up a Here account, so we need to collect a few important details about you, such as your name, username, password, email address, phone number, and date of birth.\nWe may also ask you to provide us with some additional information that will be publicly visible on our services, such as a profile picture or avatar.\nOther services, such as commerce products, may require you to provide us with a debit or credit card number and its associated account information.</p>\n<p>Of course, you\u2019ll also provide us whatever information you send through our services, such as image uploads, files, links and chat messages.\nKeep in mind that the users in shared rooms with you are able to see whatever content you post, and those users can always save that content or copy it outside the app.\nSo, the same common sense that applies to the internet at large applies to Here as well: Don\u2019t send messages or share content that you wouldn\u2019t want someone to save or share.</p>\n<p>When you contact customer support or communicate with us in any other way, we\u2019ll collect whatever information you volunteer or that we need to resolve your question.</p>Information We Get When You Use Our Services<p>When you use our services, we collect information about which of those services you\u2019ve used and how you\u2019ve used them.\nWe might know, for instance, that you selected a particular GIF, enabled video for 21 minutes with a specific group of users, or just wrote a message.\n&nbsp;Here\u2019s a fuller explanation of the types of information we collect when you use our services:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Usage Information.\nWe collect information about your activity through our services.\nFor example, we may collect information about:</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>how you interact with our services, such as which backgrounds you prefer for Rooms, or how long your Here sessions typically are.</li>\n<li>how you communicate with other Users, such as their names, the time and date of your communications, and the length of your video chats</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Content Information.\nWe collect content you create on our services, such as custom stickers, and information about the content you create or provide, such as if the recipient has viewed the content and the metadata that is provided with the content.</li>\n<li>Device Information.\nWe collect information from and about the devices you use.\nFor example, we collect:</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>information about your hardware and software, such as the hardware model, operating system version, device memory, advertising identifiers, unique application identifiers, apps installed, unique device identifiers, browser type, language, battery level, and time zone;</li>\n<li>information from device sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, compasses, microphones, and whether you have headphones connected.\nand</li>\n<li>information about your wireless and mobile network connections, such as mobile phone number, service provider, IP address, and signal strength.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Device Addressbook.\nBecause Here is all about communicating with friends and coworkers, we may\u2014with your permission\u2014collect information from your device\u2019s addressbook or contact list.</li>\n<li>Camera, Mic, Photos and Files.\nMany of our services require us to access your device camera and microphone to enable video chats.\n&nbsp;We also may need to access your image files and other files on your device so you can share them with other Users on the Service.</li>\n<li>Location Information.\nWhen you use our services we may collect information about your location.\nWith your permission, we may also collect information about your precise location using methods that include GPS, wireless networks, cell towers, Wi-Fi access points, and other sensors, such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses.</li>\n<li>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies.\nLike most online services and mobile applications, we uses cookies and similar technologies like single-pixel gifs and web beacons, to record log data.\nWe use both session-based and persistent cookies.\n&nbsp;Cookies are small text files sent by us to your computer and from your computer or mobile device to us each time you visit our website or use our desktop application.\nThey are unique to your account or your browser.\nSession-based cookies last only while your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser.\nPersistent cookies last until you or your browser delete them or until they expire.\n&nbsp;Some cookies are associated with your account and personal information in order to remember that you are logged in and which teams you are logged into.\nOther cookies are not tied to your account but are unique and allow us to carry out site analytics and customization, among other similar things.\nIf you access the Services through your browser, you can manage your cookie settings there but if you disable some or all cookies you may not be able to use the Services.\n&nbsp;Here sets and accesses our own cookies on the domains operated by Here and its corporate affiliates.\nIn addition, we use third parties like Google Analytics for website analytics.\nYou may opt-out of third party cookies from Google Analytics on its website.\nWe do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals as there is no consistent industry standard for compliance.</li>\n<li>Log Information.\nWe also collect log information when you use our website, such as:</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>details about how you\u2019ve used our services;</li>\n<li>device information, such as your web browser type and language;</li>\n<li>access times;</li>\n<li>pages viewed;</li>\n<li>IP address;</li>\n<li>identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser.\nand</li>\n<li>pages you visited before or after navigating to our website.</li>\n</ul>Information We Collect from Third Parties<p>We may collect information about you from other users, our affiliates, and third parties.\nThis might be aggregate level information, such as which IP addresses go with which zip codes, or it might be more specific information, such as about how well an online marketing or email campaign performed.</p>\n<p>To provide YouTube functionality for search and playback within Here, Here uses YouTube's API Services.\nBy using this functionality, you are subject to YouTube's Privacy Policy.</p>How We Use Information<p>What do we do with the information we collect? We use it to provide you with an amazing set of products and services that we relentlessly improve.\nHere are the ways we do that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>develop, operate, improve, deliver, maintain, and protect our products and services.</li>\n<li>send you communications, including by email.\nFor example, we may use email to respond to support inquiries or to share information about our products, services, and promotional offers that we think may interest you.</li>\n<li>monitor and analyze trends and usage.</li>\n<li>enhance the safety and security of our products and services.</li>\n<li>verify your identity and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity.</li>\n<li>use information we\u2019ve collected from cookies and other technology to enhance our services and your experience with them.</li>\n<li>enforce our Terms of Service and other usage policies and comply with legal requirements.</li>\n</ul>How We Share Information<p>We may share information about you in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>With other Here users potentially including:</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>information about you, such as your username, name, and avatar image.</li>\n<li>information about how you have interacted with our services</li>\n<li>any additional information you have directed us to share.\nFor example, Here will share your information when you connect your Here account to a third-party app, and if you share information or content from Here to the third-party app.</li>\n<li>content you post in a Room (this will be shared only with users that have access to that Room).</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>With our affiliates.</li>\n<li>With third parties.\nWe may share information about you with service providers who perform services on our behalf,</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>We may share information about you with business partners that provide services and functionality on our services.</li>\n<li>We may share information about you, such as device and usage information, to help us and others prevent fraud.</li>\n<li>We may share information about you for legal, safety, and security reasons.\nWe may share information about you if we reasonably believe that disclosing the information is needed to:</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>comply with any valid legal process, governmental request, or applicable law, rule, or regulation.</li>\n<li>investigate, remedy, or enforce potential Terms of Service violations.</li>\n<li>protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our users, or others.</li>\n<li>detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>We may share information about you as part of a merger or acquisition.\nIf Here.fm gets involved in a merger, asset sale, financing, liquidation or bankruptcy, or acquisition of all or some portion of our business to another company, we may share your information with that company before and after the transaction closes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may also share with third parties that provide services to us or perform business purposes for us aggregated, non-personally identifiable, or de-identified information.</p>Where we store your data<p>Here transfers, processes and stores data about you on servers operated by our hosting provider located in the United States of America.\nYour Personal Information may therefore be transferred to, processed and stored in a country different from your country of residence, and be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country of residence.\nInformation collected within the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to and processed by third parties referred to below that are located in a country outside of the EEA and Switzerland, where you may have fewer rights in relation to your Personal Information.\nBy using the Service and providing us with your Personal Information, you are consenting to the transfer, processing and storage of your Personal Information in countries outside of your country of residence.</p>Security<p>We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we strive to use all commercially acceptable means of protecting it.\nHowever, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.\nWe encourage you to use precautions such as strong passwords and a password manager for our service, or two-factor authentication when using third party logins.</p>Third-Party Content and Integrations<p>Our services may contain third-party content and integrations.\nExamples include third-party integrations with Gif providers or media content providers.\nThrough these integrations, you may be providing information to the third party as well as to Here.\nWe are not responsible for how those third parties collect or use your information.\nAs always, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of every third-party service that you visit or use, including those third parties you interact with through our services.</p>\n<p>How Long We Keep Your Information</p>\n<p>Here allows any user of a room to delete any content added to a room.\n&nbsp;We currently do not record or save video chats.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here is a list of some of the information we store:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We store your basic account information\u2014like your name, phone number, and email address\u2014until you ask us to delete them.</li>\n<li>We store location information for different lengths of time based on how precise it is and which services you use.</li>\n<li>We\u2019re constantly collecting and updating information about the things you might like and dislike, so we can provide you with more relevant content.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you ever decide to stop using Here, you can just email us to delete your account.\nWe\u2019ll also delete most of the information we\u2019ve collected about you after you\u2019ve been inactive for a while\u2014but don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll try to contact you first!</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that, while our systems are designed to carry out our deletion practices automatically, we cannot promise that deletion will occur within a specific timeframe.\nThere may be legal requirements to store your data and we may need to suspend those deletion practices if we receive valid legal process asking us to preserve content, if we receive reports of abuse or other Terms of Service violations, or if your account or content created by you is flagged by our automated systems for abuse or other Terms of Service violations.\nFinally, we may also retain certain information in backup for a limited period of time or as required by law.</p>California Residents<p>If you\u2019re a California resident, you have certain privacy rights under California law, including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d).\nOur California Privacy Notice specifies these rights, check it out.</p>Children<p>Our services are not intended for\u2014and we don\u2019t direct them to\u2014anyone under 13.\nAnd that\u2019s why we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13.\nIn addition, we may limit how we collect, use, and store some of the information of EU users between 13 and 16.\nIn some cases, this means we will be unable to provide certain functionality to these users.\nIf we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your information and your country requires consent from a parent, we may require your parent\u2019s consent before we collect and use that information.</p>Revisions to the Privacy Policy<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nBut when we do, we\u2019ll let you know one way or another.\nSometimes, we\u2019ll let you know by revising the date at the top of the Privacy Policy that\u2019s available on our website and mobile application.\nOther times, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our websites\u2019 homepages or providing you with an in-app notification).</p>\n<p>\n</p>California Privacy Notice<p>Effective: April 20, 2020</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve created this California Privacy Notice specifically for California residents (\u201cNotice\u201d).\nCalifornia residents have certain privacy rights as specified under California law, including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d).\nOur Privacy Policy and the privacy controls we offer to all users are in line with these laws--this Notice makes sure we cover the California-specific requirements.\nFor example, all users can request a copy of their data, request deletion, and control their privacy settings in the app.\nFor the full picture, check out our Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll start with a summary of your rights and get into the details later.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have the right to know whether we sell your data and opt-out of a sale if we do.\nGood news! We don\u2019t sell your data.</li>\n<li>You have the right to receive an overview of the personal information we collect, how we use it, and who we share your data with.</li>\n<li>You can request access to your data, get a copy, and ask us to delete your personal information.</li>\n<li>Reach out to us to exercise your California rights, which you can do at ccpa@here.fm</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By the way, we\u2019ll update this Notice every 12 months and let you know when we\u2019ve made updates consistent with our Privacy Policy .</p>Your Rights<p>Let\u2019s start with your rights.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Right to know what personal information we collect.\nYou have the right to request details on the specific personal information we\u2019ve collected about you.\nWe provide this information in our Privacy Policy, but you can also get this information by contacting us.\nIn addition, you can request a copy of your data.</li>\n<li>Right to know who we share your data with.\nWe do not sell your data, but we do share your information with others for legitimate business purposes.\nFor example, we use service providers to store and host your data.</li>\n<li>Right to deletion.\nYou have the right to request deletion of your data, unless an exception applies.\nExamples of exceptions include when we need to keep data to meet legal obligations, detect fraud, investigate reports of abuse or other Terms of Service violations, or fix security issues.\nOnce we\u2019ve verified your request, we\u2019ll delete your personal information (unless an exception applies) and will direct our service providers to do the same.</li>\n<li>Get a timely response.\nYou have the right to make two free requests in any 12-month period.\nWe will respond to your request within 45 days, and in more difficult cases we may extend our response time by another 45 days.\nOur support team is pretty great, so they tend to respond a lot quicker.\nThe easiest way to get information is by following the instructions above, but you can also email privacy @ here.fm.</li>\n<li>Non-Discrimination.\nIt goes without saying, but we will not hold it against you when you exercise any of your rights.\nIn fact, we encourage you to review your privacy settings closely and reach out to us with your questions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The easiest way to exercise your rights is by logging into your account so we can verify your identity.\nYou can also email us, but then we\u2019ll require some additional information to authenticate your identity and ownership of your account.</p>We Don\u2019t Sell Your Data<p>We don\u2019t sell your data.</p>Information We Collect<p>As detailed in our Privacy Policy, we collect personal information for a wide range of purposes, but the main reason we collect information is to offer you the best possible products and services.\nPrivacy by design is the starting point.\nThis means we make sure we don\u2019t collect more information than necessary or collect information for purposes that are different, unrelated, or incompatible with what\u2019s detailed in our Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>In the last 12 months, we\u2019ve collected the following personal information:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Identifiers, such as your name, display name, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, IP address, email address, username, or other similar identifiers.\nWe mainly use these to offer our services, for example to create your account and send messages to your real friends.</li>\n<li>Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records provisions, such as your name, address, telephone number, payment number (last 4 digits only).\nKeep in mind that some personal information included in this category may overlap with other categories.</li>\n<li>Characteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law, such as your gender and age.\nThe main purpose for collecting this information is to verify your age, ensure you are eligible to use our services.</li>\n<li>Internet or other electronic network activity information, such as session logs, search history, information on a consumer's interaction with a website, application, or advertisement.</li>\n<li>Geolocation data, such as your physical location.</li>\n<li>Electronic, visual, or similar information, such as Images and Files you uploaded to our Service.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We may collect this data when you provide it to us, when you use our services, or when we receive it from third parties.\nFor more details on the sources, see the Information We Collect section in our Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>For your information, personal information does not include publicly available information from government records and de-identified or aggregated consumer information.</p>Sharing Your Information<p>We may share your personal information to a third party for a business purpose or at your direction.\nFor example, we share your personal information with our data hosting and storage providers.\nWe enter into agreements with our service providers in which they can only use your information for specific purposes and are required to ensure its confidentiality.</p>", "created_at": "2023-06-11 20:10:35.607867", "updated_at": "2023-06-11 20:11:23.339682"}, {"id": 16411, "name": "Terms of Service", "url": "https://here.fm/terms.html", "xpath": "//body", "text": "Welcome!<p>We\u2019ve drafted these Terms of Service (which we call the \u201cTerms\u201d) so you\u2019ll know the rules that govern our relationship with you.\nAlthough we have tried our best to strip the legalese from the Terms, there are places where these Terms may still read like a traditional contract.\nThere\u2019s a good reason for that: These Terms do indeed form a legally binding contract between you and H3R3, Inc.\n(\u201cHere.fm\u201d or \u201cHere\u201d).\nSo please read them carefully.</p>\n<p>By using Here.fm, our video conferencing tools, design tools, or any of our other products or services that link to these Terms (we refer to these collectively as the \u201cServices\u201d), you agree to the Terms.\nOf course, if you don\u2019t agree with them, then don\u2019t use the Services.</p>1.\nWho Can Use the Services<p>No one under 13 is allowed to create an account or use the Services.\nWe may offer additional Services with additional terms that may require you to be even older to use them.\nSo please read all terms carefully.</p>\n<p>By using the Services, you state that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can form a binding contract with Here.fm</li>\n<li>You are not a person who is barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction\u2014including, for example, that you do not appear on the U.S.\nTreasury Department\u2019s list of Specially Designated Nationals or face any other similar prohibition.</li>\n<li>You are not a convicted sex offender.</li>\n<li>You will comply with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are using the Services on behalf of a business or some other entity, you state that you are authorized to grant all licenses set forth in these Terms and to agree to these Terms on behalf of the business or entity.</p>2.\nRights We Grant You<p>Here grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, nonexclusive, revocable, and non-sublicensable license to access and use the Services.\nThis license is for the sole purpose of letting you use and enjoy the Services\u2019 benefits in a way that these Terms and our usage policies allow.</p>\n<p>Any software that we provide you may automatically download and install upgrades, updates, or other new features.\nYou may be able to adjust these automatic downloads through your device\u2019s settings.</p>\n<p>You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these restrictions or you have our written permission to do so.</p>3.\nRights You Grant Us<p>Many of our Services let you create, upload, post, send, receive, and store content.\nContent can be images, files, notes, messages, drawing or anything else that you add to a Here room.\nWhen you do that, you retain whatever ownership rights in that content you had to begin with.\nBut you grant us a license to use that content.</p>\n<p>For all content you submit to the Services, you grant Here and our affiliates a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, and distribute that content.\nThis license is for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Services and researching and developing new ones.\nIn short, you want to post images in a room or share a file with visitors to a room, and you need to grant us a right to the images or file in order to do that.</p>\n<p>While we\u2019re not required to do so, we may access, review, screen, and delete your content at any time and for any reason, including to provide and develop the Services or if we think your content violates these Terms.\nYou alone, though, remain responsible for the content you create, upload, post, send, or store through the Service.\nYou also agree to adhere to the Copyright and Safety sections of this agreement.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, a room URL is not your content.\nall room URLs are the property of Here and can be changed at our sole discretion at any time.</p>\n<p>We always love to hear from our users.\nBut if you provide feedback or suggestions, just know that we can use them without compensating you, and without any restriction or obligation to you.</p>4.\nThe Content of Others<p>Much of the content on our Services is produced by users and other third parties.\nWhether that content is posted publicly or sent privately, the content is the sole responsibility of the person or organization that submitted it.\nAlthough Here reserves the right to review or remove all content that appears on the Services, we do not necessarily review all of it.\nSo we cannot\u2014and do not\u2014take responsibility for any content that others provide through the Services.</p>\n<p>Through these Terms and our Content Guidelines, we make clear that we do not want the Services put to bad uses.\nBut because we do not review all content, we cannot guarantee that content on the Services, or that our users\u2019 use of our Services, will always conform to our Terms or Guidelines.</p>5.\nPrivacy<p>You agree that Here may access, preserve and disclose your account information if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary: (a) as required by law or to comply with legal process.\n(b) as required to enforce our User Terms.\n(c) to provide you with customer support for the Services.\n(d) to respond to any claims that User Content or Organization Content violates the rights of other parties.\nor (d) to protect the rights, property or safety of Here and other Users on the Services or the Public at large</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You should read our entire Privacy Policy &nbsp;for more details.\n&nbsp;You acceptance of these User Terms is also an acceptance of this Privacy Policy</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>6.\nRespecting Others' Rights<p>Here respects the rights of others.\nAnd so should you.\nYou therefore may not use the Services, or enable anyone else to use the Services, in a manner that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>violates or infringes someone else\u2019s rights of publicity, privacy, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property right.</li>\n<li>bullies, harasses, or intimidates.</li>\n<li>defames.</li>\n<li>spams or solicits our users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>7.\nRespecting Copyright</p>\n<p>Here honors copyright laws, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.\nWe therefore take reasonable steps to expeditiously remove from our Services any infringing material that we become aware of.\nAnd if Here becomes aware that one of its users has repeatedly infringed copyrights, we will take reasonable steps within our power to terminate the user\u2019s account.</p>\n<p>We make it easy for you to report suspected copyright infringement.\nIf you believe that anything on the Services infringes a copyright that you own or control, please file a notice with our designated agent:</p>\n<p>email: copyright@here.fm</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t use this email address for anything other than reporting copyright infringement, as such emails will be ignored.</p>\n<p>If you file a notice with our Copyright Agent, it must comply with the requirements set forth at 17 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 512(c)(3) .\nThat means the notice must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>contain the physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</li>\n<li>identify the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.</li>\n<li>identify the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed, or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to let us locate the material.</li>\n<li>provide your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address.</li>\n<li>provide a personal statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</li>\n<li>provide a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</li>\n</ul>8.\nSafety<p>We try hard to keep our Services a safe place for all users.\nBut we can\u2019t guarantee it.\nThat\u2019s where you come in.\nBy using the Services, you agree that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will not use the Services for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited in these Terms.</li>\n<li>You will not use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper, or other automated means or interface to access the Services or extract other user\u2019s information.</li>\n<li>You will not use or develop any third-party applications that interact with the Services or other users\u2019 content or information without our written consent.</li>\n<li>You will not use the Services in a way that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect, or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Services, or that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair
