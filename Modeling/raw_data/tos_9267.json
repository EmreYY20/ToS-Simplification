participating in Lemmy.World, with some additional information about our platform.\nIt is intended to protect all our members from bad actors, and to ensure that our platform is as welcoming and inclusive as possible.\nKeep in mind that this is a working document, and so the Lemmy.World team may amend it from time to time.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>All significant changes made on this page will be announced to our users.</strong>\n</p> Goals\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Provide a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all members.\nregardless of gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, political affiliation, or other similar characteristic.\nHuman comes first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Create a supportive environment, where people freely share their passions and are excited and positive about each other\u2019s successes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Protect our community from harassment, malicious or illegal content, and from bad actors, whose goals are to disrupt our community and promote their own self-interest at the expense of others.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Principles that Guide Us\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We are not a free speech zone.\nThis Code of Conduct lays out the expected standards of conduct and behavior.\nUsers may not say or post anything that violates these rules, and all participants are required to follow this code.\nIf you disagree with this code, you are welcome to keep looking for other Lemmy instances.\nHere\u2019s a list of all public instances.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The moderators are not morality or thought police.\nThey are guided by this Code of Conduct.\nPost what you want, as long as your post follows the rules, principles, and goals outlined on this page.\nNot every user will appreciate controversial or explicit posts, so feel encouraged to use NSFW marks very liberally.\nWe use NSFW marks often so the members themselves may decide whether they want to see a post that might be controversial or explicit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bullies, trolls, and disruptors are not welcome in Lemmy.World.\nWe will moderate accordingly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This is a voluntary community.\nYou chose to be here.\nWhen you choose to join, you have implied that you agree with this Code of Conduct and will follow it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> General Guidance for Participating\n<p>\n<strong>Here is a general guidance for participating in Lemmy.World:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Do not post about inflammatory or controversial subjects without a NSFW mark.\nIdeally, you would not post about inflammatory subjects at all.\nHowever, it may be acceptable to do so in some cases, but it is never acceptable to post inflammatory content without hiding the content behind the appropriate NSFW warning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not post any type of nudity without marking it NSFW.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Regarding spam: we are not your free advertising platform.\nIf you are here only to sell your products or services, you will be removed.\nOccasional posts of commercial links are tolerated, but when the vast majority of a user\u2019s posts are commercial in nature, we regard the account as a Spam account.\nModerators will evaluate reports of Spam on a case by case basis.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not engage in name calling, ad hominem attacks, sealioning or any other uncivil behaviour.\nRemember to criticise ideas, and not people.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Don\u2019t report every post that upsets you.\nPlease do report posts that violate our rules or a community\u2019s rules, but for others that you may find distasteful, or just don\u2019t like, use the tools available to you.\nYou can block the user, and you can also block communities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A full list of rules is included on the final section of this page.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Moderation Principles\n<p>When a user violates any of the points described in our Code of Conduct, our team may suspend an account from Lemmy.World.\nThis may happen when a user has breached any rule several times, or if their content suggests that they are likely to continue to break the rules.\nThe number of breaches leading to suspension is deliberately not defined.\nIn egregious cases, one breach can result in suspension of the user account.</p>\n<p>The team takes a pragmatic approach to every situation - if they feel that a problematic post isn\u2019t explicitly a breach of any of these rules but is inappropriate for Lemmy.World, the post will likely be removed.\nUsers who repeatedly post problematic content or otherwise are seen by the team as a negative, disruptive presence in our community can be removed at the discretion of our team, even if those posts or the user did not explicitly violate our rules.</p> Staff\n<p>\n<strong>This instance has the following administrators:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Ruud
