personal information to send you marketing messages if we have either your consent or a \u2018legitimate interest\u2019.\nA \u2018legitimate interest\u2019 is when we have a business or commercial reason to use your information.\nIt must not unfairly go against what is right and best for you.<br>\n<br>\nThe personal data we have for you is made up of what you tell us, and the data we collect about you when you use our services, or data provided to us from third parties we work with.\nWe study this to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you.\nThis is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you.<br>\n<br>\nWe want to ensure that you are informed and aware of the best products, services, promotions and events that we can offer you.\nBy consenting to receive additional communications (by mail, telephone, SMS, text/picture/video message, app push notifications or email) from us and any named third parties that feature at the point of obtaining consent in respect of such information, we will process your personal data in accordance with this privacy policy.<br>\n<br>\nIf you have provided your consent to receive marketing communications from us and you change your mind, you can change your preferences and unsubscribe at any time by unsubscribing from the relevant communication channel, changing your preferences in the preference centre or by contacting us at GWR-DPO@gwr.com.\nIf you choose not to receive this information we will be unable to keep you informed of new products, services and promotions that may interest you.<br>\n<br>\nWhatever you choose, you'll still receive booking confirmations and other important information, for example service updates.<br>\n<br>\nService communications:\nAs detailed in the table at section 6, we may send you communications such as those which relate to any service updates (e.g.\nservice disruption) or provide customer satisfaction surveys.\nWe consider that we can lawfully send these communications to you as we have a legitimate interest to do so, namely to effectively provide you with the best

This section explains how we keep your personal data safe and where it will be held.<br>\n<br>\nWe take your privacy seriously and are committed to maintaining the privacy and security of the personal data you provide to us, and the choices you have regarding our collection and use of your personal data.<br>\n<br>\nOnce we have received your personal data, we follow strict security procedures as to how your personal data is stored and used, and who sees it, to help stop any unauthorised access.<br>\n<br>\nAny payment transactions will be encrypted.\nWhere we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.\nYou should not share this information with anyone.<br>\n<br>\nThe information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the United Kingdom (UK).\nWhen we transfer and store your personal data outside of the UK we will ensure that it is adequately protected by using appropriate safeguards as further detailed below.<br>\n<br>\nStaff operating outside the UK who work for us, or one of our suppliers, may process the information.\nSuch staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services;<br>\n<br>\nWhere your personal data is transferred from the UK to a recipient outside the UK in a country not recognised by the United Kingdom as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data, such transfer shall be covered by a framework recognised by the relevant authorities or courts as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data including but not limited to&nbsp;Standard Contractual Clauses (the agreement in the form annexed to the European Commission's decision of 5 February 2010 on Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries which can be found here (PDF, 776 KB))<br>\n<br> Unfortunately, the transmission of your personal data via the internet is not completely secure and although we do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to us over the internet and you acknowledge that any transmission is at your own risk.\n</li>\n<li> 10.\nHow long do we keep your personal data? This section explains the length of time that we will retain your personal data.<br>\n<br>\nWe will keep your personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it was obtained.\nThe criteria for determining the duration for which we will retain your personal data are as follows:<br>\n<br>\n(1) we will retain your personal data in a form that permits identification only for as long as:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>we maintain an ongoing relationship with you.\nor</li>\n<li>your personal data is necessary in connection with the lawful purposes set out in this policy for which we have a valid legal basis.</li>\n</ul>\nplus\n<br>\n(2) the duration of:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>any applicable limitation period under applicable law (i.e.\nany period during which any person could bring a legal claim against us in connection with your personal data, or to which your personal data may be relevant).\nor</li>\n<li>an additional reasonable period following the end of such applicable limitation period.</li>\n</ul>\nand<br>\n<br>\n(3) in addition, if any relevant legal claims are brought, we may continue to process your personal data for such additional periods as are necessary in connection with that claim.<br>\n<br>\nDuring the periods in paragraphs (2)a and (2)b above, we will restrict our processing of your personal data to the storage of, and maintaining the security of, those data, except to the extent that those data need to be reviewed in connection with any legal claim or obligation under applicable law.<br>\n<br>\nAfter this period your personal data will be anonymised so that you are no longer identified or identifiable from such information, or securely deleted/destroyed.<br>\n<br>\nAny third parties that we engage will keep your data stored on their systems for as long as is necessary to provide the relevant services to you or us.\nIf we end our relationship with any third party providers, we will make sure that they securely delete or return your personal data to us.<br>\n<br>\nThe retention periods for CCTV and BWV vary depending on the location and system in use.\nSuch periods tend not to exceed 30 days and will always be reasonable or as long as is required by law.\nFor more information please contact us using the details provided in section 13.<br>\n<br>\nWe may retain personal data about you for statistical purposes (for example, to help us better advertise our services).\nWhere data is retained for statistical purposes it will always be anonymised, meaning that you will not be identifiable from that data.\n</li>\n<li> 11.\nWhat are your rights? This section explains that you have a number of rights in relation to your personal data.\nThere are circumstances in which your rights may not apply.\nYou have the right to request that we:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>provide you with a copy of the information we hold about you;</li>\n<li>update any of your personal information if it is inaccurate or out of date;</li>\n<li>delete the personal data we hold about you - if we are providing services to you and you ask us to delete personal data we hold about you then we may be unable to continue providing those services to you;</li>\n<li>restrict the way in which we process your personal data;</li>\n<li>stop processing your data if you have valid objections to such processing.\nand</li>\n<li>transfer your personal data to a third party.</li>\n</ul>\nFor more information on your rights and how to use them, or if you would like to make any of the requests set out above, please contact us using the details provided in section 13.\nWe will respond to all such requests within the time period required by law.\nOccasionally it may take us longer, if your request is particularly complex, you have made a number of requests or you have not supplied the information we need to respond to you.\nIn this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.<br>\n<br>\nWe may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights).\nThis is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.\nWe may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.<br>\n<br>\nAs explained in the section on Communications above, even if you consented to the processing of your personal data for marketing purposes (by ticking the relevant box or by requesting information about services), you have the right to ask us to stop processing your personal data for such purposes.\nYou can exercise this right at any time by unsubscribing from the relevant communication channel, changing your preferences in the preference centre or by contacting us at GWR-DPO@gwr.com.<br>\n<br>\nYou will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).\nHowever, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.\nAlternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.\n</li>\n<li> 12.\nCookies The Website uses cookies.\nCookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your personal computer, mobile or other device when you visit a website.\nFor more information please see our Cookies Policy.\n</li>\n<li> 13.\nWho can you ask for more information?
