and regulations.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br> Accounts You can sign up for an account to use our Services.\nYou can either create an account using an email and password, or via Facebook or Google.\nWhen

limited to the text, scripts, graphics, photos, sounds, videos, questions, responses to questions and any other information that you post, communicate, transmit, record, link to or direct to any third party in any manner through the use of the Site and/or Services including, but not limited to, any presentation, appearance or participation by you through our Site and/or Services.\nFurther, you

entity;<br> (3) not use a Facebook or Google account with a fake/false identity (one that is not yourself);<br> (4) not permit others to use your account;<br> (5) not use someone else's account(s);<br> (6) not share account(s);<br> (7) not sell, trade, or transfer your our account to another party;<br> (8) not charge anyone for access to any portion of our Site and/or Services, or any information or services therein.\nand<br> (9) follow all applicable rules and regulations.\nand general conduct stated in these Terms of Service.<br> (10) not create multiple/duplicate accounts<br> You are solely responsible for all the activities performed on/using your account unless you report misuse.<br>\n<br> You must notify us immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized access of your account.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br> Premium Accounts and Subscriptions ('Resume Worded Pro') Some features are only accessible to Premium members, also referred to as 'Resume Worded Pro' members.\nThese can be purchased directly on our site.\nAlternatively, they can be provided via your organization (e.g.\nbusiness or university) if they have already been prepaid.<br> These features include:<br> (a) Searchable database of over 200 resume lines<br> (b) Full resume reviews using Score My Resume (Resume Worded's resume analytics engine)<br> (c) Database of over 50 metrics<br> (d) Suggested resume lines through Score My Resume<br> (e) Resume templates<br> (f) Resume line-by-line analysis<br> (g) Targeting with Targeted Resume<br> (h) Full LinkedIn reviews using LinkedIn Review<br>\n<br> For Resume Worded Pro members, you agree to pay all applicable fees (inclusive of taxes) and provide us with the necessary payment information in order to access Resume Worded Pro features and any default in payment of these fees may result in termination of your Resume Worded Pro Service.\nThere are multiple payment plans available for Resume Worded Pro members, including a subscription based offering (monthly or quarterly) and a one-time option (one year).\nUsers/members are expected to cancel/update their subscriptions in their account portal.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br> Billing process/cycles for Resume Worded Pro members/subscribers\nWhen you sign up for any of our subscription Premium plans, you will be billed every calendar month (Monthly Plan) or Quarterly (every 3 months Plan) from the date of subscription.\nUntil you cancel, billing will continue according to the cycle stated at the time of subscription.\n<br>\n<br>\nResume Worded is not responsible for continued subscriptions should a user forget to cancel their account.\nIt is the customer\u2019s responsibility to confirm the cancellation.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br> Payments and orders are handled by Paddle Our order process is conducted by our online reseller Paddle.com.\nPaddle.com is the Merchant of Record for all our orders.\nPaddle provides all customer service inquiries and handles returns.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br> Refunds Due to the nature of our offering, we are unable to provide refunds to new users who purchase for the first time.\nThe reason is that Resume Worded is a Freemium product and you can \"inspect the product\" and all the site's features in a limited capacity for free, before becoming a paid member (i.e.\nYou get a subset of resume lines for free, subset of the resume analysis is free with Score My Resume, and all our tools have a free tier).\nOur free tier is extremely generous, and we encourage you to use all features so you know exactly what's in the paid version.\nTo protect ourselves from abuse (i.e.\npeople buying the product, using it to the fullest, and requesting a refund when they are done using it), we can't refund new users.\nSince you were/are able to inspect what you buy before buying, we can't offer refunds.\nWe appeal any chargebacks aggressively, which means you may have to pay a fine for purchases you made where you used the product but still decided to request a refund.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Existing Pro members who forgot to cancel:</strong>\n<br> If you're an existing Pro member and you forgot to cancel your subscription in time before it renewed, please contact us immediately (maximum within 3 days of your billing date).\nYou can contact us via this form or via email at support {at} resumeworded.com.\nIf you have not used the service in the time between being billed and the time of contacting us, we'll be able to provide refunds depending on the circumstances.\nPlease note that we are unable to offer refunds if you contact us outside the 3 day window.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br> Modifications We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify or otherwise alter the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms of Service at any time and you agree to be bound by such changes, modifications or alterations.\nSuch modifications shall become effective immediately upon the posting thereof on the Site and/or Services.\nYour continued use of our Site and/or Services after any changes will signify and confirm your acceptance of those changes.<br> We aim to create the best experience for our Users.\nTherefore, the Site and/or Services provided may change which includes, but is not limited to, updates, upgrades or discontinuation of features, components or modules, without prior notification, as part of our effort to update, improve and expand the Site and/or Services.\n<br>Resume Worded is not obligated to inform you of any such changes and you are solely responsible for periodically checking <br> the Site and/or Services for changes.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br> Upload Limits and 'Fair Use' Policy We offer a service that allows users to upload resumes and LinkedIn files to our service for review, with the option to purchase an upgrade to a Pro account for 'unlimited' uploads.\nWhile we offer 'unlimited uploads' to Pro users, we have a fair use policy in place to prevent abuse of our software.\nThis fair use policy allows users to access and use our core tools (Score My Resume, Targeted Resume and LinkedIn Review) up to a maximum of 250 times per month.\n<br>\n<br> If we determine that a user's use of our software exceeds this fair use limit, we reserve the right to terminate their Pro account and prevent further access to our software.\nWe also reserve the right to take legal action against any user who violates our fair use policy or otherwise abuses our software.\n<br> Acceptable Use Policy Unauthorized Use: Resume Worded authorizes you to view and access a single copy of the content available on or from the Site solely for their personal use.\nAny recommendations or advice provided by us on the Site and/or

may access the Website using the same email or password, as stated in the Accounts section above.\nResume Worded reserves the right, in our sole discretion, to immediately revoke your account and/or seek all other legal remedies available for copying copyrighted text (including the recommendations, resume lines, metrics, or any site content), or otherwise misusing or misappropriating site
