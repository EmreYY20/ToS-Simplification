from our paying customers, so there's no need or reason to sell, rent or give away any of your data (that's not our business model).</p>\n<p>In May 2020, we further solidified our privacy efforts with a comprehensive GDPR project led by a European-based GDPR consulting company.\nWe reviewed all our obligations under the GDPR, updated our records of processing activities per Article 30, performed data protection risk assessments, formalized several policies and procedures and various other activities.</p>\n<p>We have also formally appointed a Privacy Officer to help us stay continuously up to date with global data protection and privacy rules and regulations.</p>\n<p>We hope to provide you with clear and transparent information on how we process your personal data (as a controller) and your data protection rights.\nIf you feel that any information is unclear or missing, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>\n<p>We start this policy by describing our processing as the controller

one of your rights.\nYou are entitled to a reply within 30 days.</p> How we get your personal data <p>We typically process personal data on potential or existing customers, website visitors and

data for as long as we are required to as per applicable legal obligations such as accounting, tax, labour laws or any other relevant rules and regulations.\nOne example is the Canadian Income Tax Act, where we are required to retain data for as long as someone is a customer and then for at least six years.</p> Details on the processing of your personal data <p>This section describes when and how we process your data, for what purposes and our legal grounds to do so (lawful bases).\nWe also specify the retention periods for the processing.</p>\n<p>\n<em>We process personal data

someone is a customer and then for at least six years for accounting and bookkeeping purposes.</p> You receive marketing as an existing customer <p>If we have an existing customer relationship with you, we may send you emails containing a promotional element (this happens very infrequently).\nThe personal data we process is your name and email address.\nThe purpose is to provide you with news and offers related to your subscription.\nThe lawful basis is f), where our legitimate interest is to offer our relevant products and services.\nThe lawful basis could also be a), where you have given us your consent to such marketing.</p>\n<p>You can opt-out of marketing emails at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in any such email.\nWe process the data for as long as we have a customer relationship with you or if the processing is based on your consent until you withdraw it.\nWhen you ask us not to send you any promotional materials, your account will be flagged as \"unsubscribed from marketing\" in our internal database, and you won't receive any further marketing emails from us.\nWe are still required to process data for accountancy, tax and other business purposes if you

purposes.</p> You use our website <p>When you use our website, we briefly process your IP address and user agent, which are considered personal data under the GDPR.\nFollowing a significant DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack, we were also forced to start keeping partial access logs.\nWe don't keep track of which pages are viewed, only the time &amp.\ntotal requests per IP.\nThe purposes for this processing are a) to protect against cyberattacks such as the DDoS one and b) to analyze our website traffic to optimize and run our business effectively.\nThe lawful basis is f), where our legitimate interests protect our business against cyberattacks and optimize and run our business effectively.</p>\n<p>\n<em>PS: We don't use cookies or similar technology on our website, and we don't collect any personal data that would trigger the consent requirement under the ePrivacy Directive (Directive 2009/136/EC).\nWe use our own ePrivacy Compliant Analytics service.</em>\n</p> Whom we share your personal data with <p>To run our business efficiently and securely, we sometimes will have to share your personal data with other (trusted) parties such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Data processors</strong>: providers of various services that process your personal data on our behalf</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Our accountant</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Professional advisors from other industries</strong>, such as law and finance</li>\n<li>\n<strong>IT support, when necessary</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Public authorities</strong>: when we are obliged to report to them</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We require that all such recipients secure data in accordance with good information security and as per the requirements of this Privacy notice.\nWe review and quality assure all vendors and data processors and enter into a data processing agreement/addendum whenever necessary.</p>\n<p>We use data processors for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Email, calendar and digital meetings</li>\n<li>Accounting/bookkeeping</li>\n<li>This website, including online payments providers</li>\n<li>Transactional emails to customers</li>\n<li>Support ticket system</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We don't publish further details (like names) of our data processors to protect our business.\nIf you'd like to know more about our processing and with whom we share your personal data, please get in touch with us.\nWe practice data minimization, so we will only use data suppliers to process your personal data when required (e.g.\nStripe for payment processing).</p> Transfer of personal data outside the EU/EEA <p>In some cases, your personal data will be transferred to a \"third country\", i.e.\noutside the EU/EEA.\nFor example, where we use data processors to manage email services.\nWe only use data processors we trust that are well known, reputable, and have a data processing agreement/addendum.</p>\n<p>We have ensured that every data processor in a third country has necessary safeguards in place like the EU adequacy decision, standard contractual clauses (SCC) or binding corporate rules (BCR).</p>\n<p>We conduct risk assessments for every data processor we use in our business.\nIn addition, where your personal data is transferred outside of the EU/EEA, we conduct an additional risk assessment.\nWe review, in particular, the data processor's technical and organizational security measures, reputation and safeguards for international transfers of personal data.</p>\n<p>In line with the Schrems II ruling and the EDPB's recommendations, we have also conducted transfer impact assessments (TIA).\nFinally, we're currently working on a new technique called EU Isolation to address the ruling.\nWe'll update this privacy notice as soon as we have more information.</p>\n<p>If you still have any concerns or questions, please get in touch with us.</p> Information security <p>We take information security as seriously as privacy, and we will always do our utmost to safeguard your personal data in the best possible way.\nFor example, we use strong passwords, data encryption, two-factor authentication and several other measures to secure our data and prevent unauthorized persons from accessing, altering, deleting, or in any way affecting the data we store, <em>including</em> your personal data.</p>\n<p>We only allow others to access or process your personal data in accordance with our instructions and only when strictly necessary (e.g.\nin the unlikely event that we require IT support).</p>\n<p>We have created and implemented a dedicated IT security policy for technical and organizational measures and a routine for managing data breaches.\nSuppose we experience a personal data breach, i.e.\na breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data, and it poses a medium to high risk for the people affected.\nIn that case, we will notify the national data authority within 72 hours.\nIf the risk is deemed high for the people affected, we will inform them directly, if possible.</p> Our role as a data processor <p>When you use Fathom Analytics on your website, we process data from your website visitors on your behalf.\nIn this case, you are the controller of such data, and we are a data processor of yours.\nWe comply with the requirements as per GDPR Article 28, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only carry our processing on your behalf and as per your instructions</li>\n<li>Use sufficient technical and organizational security measures to protect the data we process on your behalf</li>\n<li>Require our employees to treat your data as confidential</li>\n<li>Govern this processing by a contract (a data processing addendum) [DPA being published publicly soon]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also engage other (sub)processors as per your general written authorization and will inform you of any intended changes regarding such (sub)processors to object to such changes, should you not agree to them.</p>\n<p>You can view a detailed Data journey of what happens when you use Fathom analytics on your website.\nAnd you can explore our privacy law compliance section for more information.</p> We process minimal personal data on your behalf <p>Since we built Fathom Analytics from the ground up with privacy in mind, we have minimized the amount of personal data being processed to only include the IP address and User-Agent (in line with one of the fundamental principles of the GDPR.\nArticle 5(1)(c)).</p>\n<p>The IP address and User-Agent are considered personal data under the GDPR, and the lawful basis for processing is usually consent or legitimate interest.\nSince the IP address is provided by the internet service provider and not by the user's <em>terminal equipment</em>, we do not consider such information to constitute \"information stored in the terminal equipment\".\nIP addresses provided in that manner are therefore outside the scope of Article 5 (3), and the consent requirement will not apply under the ePrivacy Directive (Directive 2009/136/EC).\nIn addition, User-Agent is not accessed from <em>terminal equipment</em>, it is sent to us by your browser, and it's impossible for us not to receive it.\nNote: This may change in the future as browsers move to remove user agent strings.</p>\n<p>As per the Schrems II ruling, we are currently working out how we process data in the EU.\nThis will be available on our website shortly, and this privacy notice will then reflect this change.</p> Accessing and Correcting your Personal Data <p>You have a right to access your personal data and request a correction if you believe it is inaccurate.\nIf you have submitted Personal Information and would like to have access to it, or if you would like to have it corrected, please get in touch with us using the contact information provided below.</p> How to Contact Us <p>If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy or to access your information, please send a written request
