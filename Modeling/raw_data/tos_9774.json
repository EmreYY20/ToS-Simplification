third party.</p>\n<p> Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below.\nIn any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>\nInformation transfer and storage\n<p>Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a country other than your own.\nYou are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international

processing.\n(iv) you have the right to verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to be updated or corrected.\n(v) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of your information, in which case, we will not process your information for any purpose other than storing it.\n(vi) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us.\n(vii) you have the right to receive your information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance.\nThis provision is applicable provided that your information is processed by automated means and that the processing is based on your consent, on a contract which you are part of or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.</p>\nThe right to object to processing\n<p>Where Personal Information is processed for the public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in us or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation to justify the objection.\nYou must know that, however, should your Personal Information be processed for direct marketing purposes, you can object to that processing at any time without providing any justification.\nTo learn, whether we are processing Personal Information for direct marketing purposes, you may refer to the relevant sections of this document.</p>\nHow to exercise
