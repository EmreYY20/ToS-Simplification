a Tilia Account or access or use the Tilia Service.\n</p>\n<p>As the Tilia Service is integrated into Platforms offered by Publishers, you may be asked to provide certain personal data to a Publisher

may, using payment methods supported by Tilia, make payments to the relevant Publisher or other users of the Publishers Platform for products or services offered within the Publisher\u2019s Platform and/or other amounts owed to the Publisher (such service, the \u201cPayment Processing Service\u201d).\n</p>\n<p>In offering the Payment Processing Service, Tilia\u2019s responsibilities to you are limited to remitting payment successfully received by Tilia from you to the relevant Publisher or user in accordance with your instructions.\nTilia is not responsible for any product or service purchased through your use of the Payment Processing Service, or for the amount or validity of any amount that may be charged by the relevant Publisher or user.</p>\n<p>If the Payment Processing Service is enabled for your particular Platform, you will be directed to a Tilia-hosted dialog box after selecting the option on the Platform to make a payment (e.g., for Platform subscription fees), at which time you will have the option to complete the transaction using one of the payment methods that Tilia supports.\nThe different payment methods supported by the Payment Processing Service, such as credit cards, debit cards, etc., will be determined by Tilia in its sole discretion, and Tilia reserves the right to limit the payment methods made available for any particular transaction.</p>\n<p>You may need to have an existing account or other access device in order to use a particular payment method, or meet other specific conditions imposed by the company responsible for offering such payment method (each a \"Payment Services Provider\" or \"PSP\").\nAdditionally, the PSP might have its own terms and conditions (including a privacy policy) that also apply to you and your use of the relevant payment method, even when such payment method is accessed through the Payment Processing Service.\nTilia is not responsible for any terms and conditions, privacy policy, other policies and procedures, or any act or omission of any PSP.</p>\n<p>In order to conduct a payment through the Payment Processing Service, you will need to provide your payment or account information, and any other information, required by Tilia and the PSP you have selected.\nThe information required and the manner in which your transaction will be processed will vary depending upon the payment method you select.\nYou are responsible for providing accurate transaction and payment information (including any relevant PSP credentials, preferences, or log-in information) in connection with your use of the Payment Processing Service.\nIf you fail to provide accurate transaction or payment information, your account may be suspended or terminated, and you will be responsible for any costs incurred by Tilia due to this failure.\nYou acknowledge that it is your responsibility to ensure that your credit or debit cards or other access devices accepted by Tilia continue to be valid and sufficient for such purposes and remain responsible to Tilia for the amount of any chargeback or returned payment.\nWithout limiting any other rights or remedies of Tilia, Tilia may exercise its termination rights as provided in Section 8 of these Terms in the event of non-payment.</p>\n<p>Once you complete and submit the requested information to Tilia, Tilia will forward the relevant information you provide to the selected PSP, which will then authorize or decline the transaction according to its own processes and rules.\nIf the transaction is authorized, the PSP will debit your account or designated funding source for the amount of the transaction (including any fees owed to Tilia for using the Payment Processing Service).\nUpon Tilia's receipt of those funds from the PSP, Tilia will remit such amount (less any amounts owed to Tilia) to the Publisher in accordance with the payment terms established between Tilia and the Publisher or to the other user of the Platform.\nPayments made to a Publisher through your use of the Payment Processing Service will be credited by the Publisher in accordance with the terms and conditions established by the Publisher.\nPlease contact the Publisher for further information.\nWe are not responsible for any delay with respect to when payments made to a Publisher will be credited to you, or any failure of a Publisher to accept or properly process any funds remitted to it.\nOnce accepted by Tilia, you may not cancel a payment made through the Payment Processing Service or obtain a refund from Tilia for any such payment.\nIn the event that you wish to obtain a refund of any payment made, you must contact the relevant Publisher, and the availability of any refund will be subject to the relevant Platform TOS and the determination of the relevant Publisher.</p>\n<p>By using the Payment Processing Service, you authorize Tilia to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accept and remit payments made by you using the payment methods supported by Tilia for purchases or other transactions enabled for the particular Platform or for amounts owed to the relevant Publisher or user plus any applicable taxes Tilia is required to collect or fees owed to Tilia;</li>\n<li>Provide your payment and/or account information, and any other information you have provided to Tilia, to the PSP you have selected as may be required to process your requested transaction;</li>\n<li>Automatically charge, in accordance with the instructions you provide for any recurring payments, the credit or debit card or other payment method you have associated with your Tilia Account in order to pay recurring amounts to the relevant Publisher, as well as any applicable taxes Tilia is required to collect or fees owed to Tilia.\nand</li>\n<li>Maintain and utilize your PSP credentials, preferences, and log-in information.</li>\n</ul>4.\n<strong>Stored Value Balances</strong>\n<p>4.1.\nGeneral</p>\n<p>Tilia may offer a Stored Value Balance associated with your Account, which is a stored value account issued by Tilia in which you hold funds.</p>\n<p>The Stored Value Balance services provided to you by Tilia are a hosted digital wallet issued by Tilia enabling you to store funds or Digital Tokens electronically (the \"Stored Value Balance\").\nand certain payment services enabling you to do the following:<br>a) send funds or Digital Tokens electronically (i.e., funds held in the Stored Value Balance can be used to make payments to other Platform users or to the Publisher);<br>b) receive funds or Digital Tokens electronically in accordance with Section 4.2 below (i.e., funds can be received into the Stored Value Balance from you, other Platform users, or the Publisher or as a result of the exchange of Digital Tokens issued by Tilia on a Platform).\nand,<br>c) redeem funds held in the Stored Value Balance in accordance with Section 4.3 below.</p>\n<p>Depending on our arrangement with the Publisher, your Stored Value Balance may hold funds denominated in fiat or Digital Tokens, defined in Section 5 below, and we will show the balance that you hold, to the extent applicable.\nThe default fiat for the Stored Value Balance will be United States Dollars (\u201cUSD\u201d).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The use of each Stored Value Balance is limited to the Platform in connection with which it is issued, meaning that it may not be used to make payments to any other Publisher, or through any other Platform, with which the Tilia Service is integrated.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You must not create security over your Stored Value Balance unless we say you can in writing.</p>\n<p>4.2 Crediting the Stored Value Balance<br>\n</p>\n<p>You may fund your Stored Value Balance denominated in fiat using any of our supported payment methods, which are set out and available on the Publisher\u2019s website, such as credit or debit card or bank transfer.\nThe Stored Value Balance denominated in Digital Tokens can only be funded by the sale of a Digital Good on the applicable Platform.</p>\n<p>In accordance with our obligations under applicable anti-money laundering regulations, you will not have access to your funds without providing information as required in Section 2.4 of these Terms.</p>\n<p>The Stored Value Balance is not a deposit or investment account.\n</p>\n<p>We will ensure that once we have received the funds associated with your fiat-denominated Stored Value Balance they are deposited in a secure account, specifically for the purpose of redeeming transactions made from your Stored Value Balance.\nFunds will not be insured to you by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other entity, and you will not be entitled to any interest with respect to such funds.\nIn the event that we become insolvent funds that you have loaded which have arrived with and been deposited by us are protected against the claims made by our creditors.</p>\n<p>4.3 Withdrawals and Redemptions</p>\n<p>You may redeem all or part of any fiat-denominated balance held in your Stored Value Balance at any time.\nWith respect to a Stored Value Balance denominated in Digital Tokens, only Digital Tokens acquired from the sale of a Digital Good may be redeemed for fiat to fund your fiat-denominated Stored Value Account, otherwise \u201cunearned\u201d Digital Tokens may not be redeemed for fiat.</p>\n<p>Funds will be transferred to your bank account or payment service provider which you have identified to us and which we support.\nPrior to permitting you to redeem funds, Tilia may require you to demonstrate that the name associated with your Tilia Account matches the name associated with your bank account or account with another payment service provider.\nFor Digital Tokens, funds will be transferred to your Stored Value Balance denominated in fiat.\n<strong>Prior to loading your Stored Value Balance denominated in fiat, it is your responsibility to determine if funds can be transferred to the relevant payment service provider as certain payment service providers (e.g., PayPal) do not offer services in every jurisdiction.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We will charge a redemption fee (a \u201c<strong>Redemption Fee</strong>\u201d) upon redemption of your Stored Value Balance.\nThis fee is set out in the Fee Schedule published on the Website (which shall include the relevant Publisher platform).\n</p>\n<p>We have the right to impose limitations on your Account if we suspect that your Account is associated with illegal or suspicious activities, fraud, or otherwise poses a risk to us, the Tilia Service, a Platform or other third parties.\nPrior to permitting you to redeem funds from your Stored Value Balance, we may conduct checks for the purposes of preventing fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing and other financial crimes.\nYou may be prevented or delayed from withdrawing funds in the Stored Value Balance until those checks are completed to our reasonable satisfaction in order to comply with our regulatory requirements.\nIf we find that you have been engaged in fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing or other financial crimes, you may be temporarily or permanently unable to redeem funds from your Stored Value Balance and you may be deemed to have forfeited your interest in such funds.</p>\n<p>The redemption request will be subject to a fee payable to Tilia, and the redemption will be processed within approximately five (5) to ten (10) business days following the request but may take up to thirty (30) days to process.</p>\n<p>If these Terms are terminated or your Account is closed for any reason, we will redeem any funds remaining in your Stored Value Balance and transfer funds to the bank account you have registered with us.\n</p>\n<p>Tilia has a right of set-off.\ntherefore, if you owe Tilia fees or any other amount, we are permitted to take the amount you owe us from your Stored Value Balance.\n</p>\n<p>You are responsible for paying taxes or costs that apply to payments you make or receive through your Stored Value Balance and Tilia is not responsible for collecting these from you.</p>\n<p>You agree that Tilia may apply any funds to be credited to, or which are held in, your Stored Value Balance to any amounts you owe Tilia pursuant to these Terms.\nTo secure your performance of these Terms, you hereby grant to Tilia a lien on any security interest in and to the funds in your Stored Value Balance in the possession of Tilia.</p>\n<p>4.4 Transactions Involving the Stored Value Balance</p>\n<p>Where a transaction is initiated from your Stored Value Balance using your security credentials, we will assume that you authorized such transaction, unless you notify us otherwise.</p>\n<p>If you believe that a transaction using your Stored Value Balance has been carried out that you did not authorize (an \"<strong>Unauthorized Transaction</strong>\"), or if you have reason to believe that a transaction using your Stored Value Balance has been incorrectly carried out or is not complete (an \"<strong>Incorrect Transaction</strong>\"), you must contact us as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>It is important that you regularly check your Stored Value Balance and your transaction history to ensure any Unauthorized Transactions or Incorrect Transactions are identified and notified to us at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>\n<p>We are not responsible for any claim for Unauthorized Transactions or Incorrect Transactions unless you have notified us in accordance with this Section 4.4, in which case we set out below our respective responsibilities.\n</p>\n<p>As further described below, we are not responsible for any claim for Unauthorized Transactions or Incorrect Transactions if you have acted fraudulently, intentionally, carelessly or with negligence and this has resulted in the Unauthorized Transactions or Incorrect Transactions.</p>\n<p>During any investigation of any actual or potential Unauthorized Transactions or Incorrect Transactions, we reserve the right to suspend your Stored Value Balance to avoid further losses.</p>\n<p>If an Unauthorized Transaction occurs as a result of Tilia\u2019s failure, we will refund you the amount of that transaction by no later than the end of the next business day after becoming aware of the Unauthorized Transaction and restore your Stored Value Balance to the state it would have been in had the Unauthorized Transaction not taken place.\n</p>\n<p>Generally, you will not be liable for losses incurred after you have notified us of the Unauthorized Transaction or if we have failed at any time to provide you with the means for notifying us.</p>\n<p>We may charge you for the first $20 of any losses you incur in respect of an Unauthorized Transaction which arises from the use of lost or stolen credentials (for example when you have failed to keep the login details secure), and if you are fraudulent, or you intentionally or negligently fail to carry out your obligations under these Terms and this results in Unauthorized Transactions (for example, if you deliberately share your email and password with a third party, or are careless or negligent in keeping your email and password secure), you may be liable for all resultant losses incurred as a result of any such Unauthorized Transactions, not just the first $20.</p>\n<p>Where there is a dispute between us regarding whether or not a transaction is an Unauthorized Transaction, we may (but are not obliged to) temporarily credit your Stored Value Balance while we settle the dispute.\n</p>\n<p>Where we determine that the transaction was authorized, we may reverse that credit and correct errors made in any statement of Stored Value Balance without prior notice to you, although please note that during this period your Stored Value Balance may be temporarily locked to avoid further Unauthorized Transactions.\nYou will also be liable to us (as a debt) for any funds you have transferred which were temporarily credited to your Stored Value Balance.</p>\n<p>Where an Incorrect Transaction is made because of our action or error we shall refund to you the amount of that transaction without undue delay and restore your Stored Value Balance to the state in which it would have been had the Incorrect Transaction not

enforcement of these Terms or your violation of any law, rule or regulation, or the rights of any third party.</p>12.\n<strong>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</strong>\n<p>12.1.\nNotifications of Dispute</p>\n<p>Our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly.\nIf any controversy, allegation or claim arises out of or relates to the Tilia Service, the Website(s), the Content, these Terms, your decision to enter into these Terms, or any Additional Terms (collectively, \u201cDispute\u201d), then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it.\nOur notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us.\nHowever, if no such information exists or if such information is not current or correct, then we have no obligation under this section.\nYour notice to us must be sent to: Tilia LLC, 8605 Santa Monica Blvd PMB 59201, West Hollywood, California 90069-4109 US, Attention: General Counsel.\nFor a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, Tilia and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute, though neither party is required to resolve such dispute on terms which each party, in its sole discretion, is uncomfortable.\nArbitration Procedure</p>\n<p>IF WE CANNOT RESOLVE A DISPUTE WITHIN SIXTY (60) DAYS OF RECEIPT OF SUCH NOTICE, THEN EITHER YOU OR WE MAY ELECT TO SUBMIT THE DISPUTE TO FORMAL ARBITRATION AS HEREINAFTER DESCRIBED.\nWITH ARBITRATION (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED.</p>\n<p>Further, you and Tilia agree that, should resolution of the Dispute(s) occur in arbitration, such Dispute(s) will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitration or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.\nBut if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator selected pursuant to this arbitration provision holds that this restriction, limiting the arbitration to Dispute(s) between you and Tilia, is unenforceable, then our agreement above to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to Section 13.5 (Law and Venue).</p>\n<p>Should either you or Tilia elect to resolve the Dispute by way of binding arbitration, the arbitration shall proceed in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"<strong>AAA</strong>\"), except that in no event shall the arbitration proceed as a class or representative action.\nIf the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $10,000,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a single, neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than ten (10) years' experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the Dispute, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.\nIf the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $10,000,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a three (3) member panel, with one member to be selected by each party and the third (who will chair the panel) selected by the two (2) party-appointed members or by the AAA in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules.\nThe arbitrator or arbitration panel, as the case may be, will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms and any Additional Terms, will determine any Dispute according to applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award.</p>\n<p>If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within sixty (60) days of the filing of a \"demand for arbitration,\" then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc.\n(\"<strong>JAMS</strong>\") using JAMS' streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and a legal officer of Tilia consent to in writing, except, as noted above, that in no event shall the arbitration proceed as a class or representative action.\nThe substantive practice area requirements for the arbitrator and the $10,000,000 threshold for the number of arbitrators assigned to the Dispute set forth in the paragraph above will also apply to any such arbitration under JAMS or other arbitration service.</p>\n<p>You can obtain AAA and JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows:<br>AAA: 1.800.778.7879 or www.adr.org<br>\u200dJAMS: 1.800.352.5267 or www.jamsadr.com</p>\n<p>\u200dAll parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing.\nIf the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $250,000, an arbitration hearing will be conducted, at your election, either by telephone (or other mutually agreeable remote technology) or in the City and County of San Francisco, California.\nIf the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $250,000, the arbitration will be conducted in the City and County of San Francisco, California.\nYou and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator's fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules (including any rules regarding hardship).\nbut if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Tilia to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this arbitration provision to be enforceable, or if the arbitrator(s) determine that you would experience an extreme hardship by paying your share of arbitration fees and costs prior to resolution of the Dispute, then Tilia will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration.\nDiscovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules.\nThe arbitrator's decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award (if any) may be entered in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration Act.\nThe arbitrator must honor the terms of these Terms (and any Additional Terms) and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys' fees) consistent with applicable law.</p>13.\n<strong>General Provisions</strong>\n<p>13.1.\nAmendments</p>\n<p>We may change these Terms at any time in our sole discretion to the extent permitted by law.\nIf we modify these Terms, we will post the modification on the Website and/or provide you notice of the modification by email or conspicuous notification, such as a popup, on the Platform and, in the event any such modifications decrease your rights or increase your obligations, will do so prior to such modification taking effect.</p>\n<p>When we change these Terms, the then-current version of these Terms supersedes all prior versions and governs your access to and use of the Tilia Service.\nIf you continue to maintain your Account or use any portion of the Tilia Service following any change, you are deemed to have accepted and agreed to any changes, as of the effective date of any such change.\nIf you do not wish to be bound to the changes, you must close your Account (see Section 8.6 for details) and cease using the Tilia Service.</p>\n<p>If any part of these Terms are inconsistent with any legal requirements then we will not rely on that part but treat it as if it did actually reflect the relevant legal requirement.\nIf we need to make operational changes before we can fully comply with the new regulatory requirement, we will make those changes as soon as reasonably practical.</p>\n<p>You can obtain a copy of the current Terms here or by e-mailing a request to us at tilia-support@tilia.io.</p>\n<p>13.2.\nEntire Understanding and Agreement</p>\n<p>Any headings or descriptive summary sentences contained in these Terms are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of these Terms.\nAdditionally, the terms \u201cinclude\u201d and \u201cincluding\u201d are not limiting.\nAs used in these Terms, references to a determination made in Tilia\u2019s discretion means that the determination will be made by Tilia in accordance with its good faith business judgment.\nIf any provision of these Terms shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, then in such jurisdiction that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.</p>\n<p>These Terms (including documents incorporated by reference herein) comprise the entire understanding and agreement between you and us as to the subject matter hereof, and supersede
