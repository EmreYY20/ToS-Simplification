People Behind .ORGAbout PIRPoliciesPIR Privacy Notice <strong>Privacy Notice</strong>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our globally diverse team is committed to providing a stable online platform where everyone has a voice.\nAs part of our commitment to provide a secure, stable space to empower people\u2019s voices, your privacy is important to us.\nLikewise, we strive to respect your human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>\n<p>This Privacy Notice outlines what information Public Interest Registry (PIR) collects through your interactions with our products and services, how we use that information, and how we work to protect your privacy and personal data.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>Privacy Notice (</strong>\n<strong>all gTLDs under management)</strong>\n<p>PIR provides reliable, secure management of the .org, .ngo, .ong, .gives, .charity, .foundation, .\u673a\u6784, .\u0938\u0902\u0917\u0920\u0928, .\u043e\u0440\u0433 domains.\nAs the registry operator for these generic top-level domains (gTLD), PIR is responsible for the operation of each gTLD, including maintaining a registry of the domain names within each gTLD.</p>\n<p>PIR serves as the registry operator for these gTLDs under contracts with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a not-for-profit private sector organization which is charged with coordinating and ensuring the stable and secure operation of the Internet\u2019s unique identifier systems.</p>\n<p>This Privacy Notice outlines policies that apply to information processed in conjunction with all PIR\u2019s products and services.</p>\n<p>Inquiries can be made electronically via e-mail at privacy@pir.org, or via mail to Public Interest Registry c/o Privacy Office, 11911 Freedom Drive, 10th Floor, Suite 1000, Reston, VA 20190, USA , or via PIR\u2019s EU Representative at datenschutz@rickert.net or Rickert Rechtsanwaltsgesellschaft mbH, Kaiserplatz 7-9, 53113, Bonn, Germany.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>I.\nWhy Do We Collect Information? </strong>\n<p>As a registry operator, PIR has the responsibility to maintain the operation of each of its gTLDs, including effecting registrations in TLDs and maintaining a registry of the domain names within each gTLD.\nPIR takes actions to process information and directs the actions of third parties to process data in connection with our responsibilities as a registry operator to ensure domain name registrations function in a predictable and reliable way as required by our contracts with ICANN.</p>\n<p>As defined by our ICANN contracts, PIR works with ICANN accredited registrars to enable the sale of domain names and to ensure those domain names properly function for registrants (domain name owners).\nIn order to provide domain name services and maintain a secure zone, registrars are required to collect information from registrants upon registration of a domain name.\nRegistrars are then required to pass certain information to registries to maintain the functionality of the zone.\nAll of these requirements are outlined in both the registry and registrar contracts with ICANN and the subsequent required contracts between registries and registrars.</p>\n<p>Registrars are responsible for collecting and transferring registration data, presenting each registrant with their privacy policies, that of their registry partners, and information on the mechanisms for access and correction of their data.\nBecause you may choose any ICANN accredited registrar to register a domain name, questions regarding a registrar\u2019s privacy policy or practices should be directed to your Registrar.</p>\n<p>ICANN, registries, and registrars are joint controllers for all information collected, stored, transferred, and processed in line with our Registry contracts with ICANN.</p>\n<p>In addition to the joint controller relationship between ICANN, registries, and registrars, registries and registrars are required to securely escrow registry data with ICANN accredited data escrow providers to provide protection against the unlikely event of registry or registrar failure or loss.</p>\n<p>PIR will also collect and process information from employees and applicants seeking employment with PIR.\nInformation collected for employment and hiring will only be used for those purposes and will only be retained for as long as is required by applicable law.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>II.\nInformation We Collect</strong>\n<p>PIR receives domain name registrations, and the associated personal data provided upon registration of a domain name by registrants, from ICANN accredited registrars.\nIn addition to domain name registration data, PIR collects information from users interacting with our websites and services.\nThe data PIR collects depends on your interactions with our websites and services:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Much of what we collect is provided directly by you during the process of registering a domain name from an ICANN accredited registrar pursuant to a domain name registration contract.</li>\n<li>We collect information about you when you interact with a PIR website, participate in a survey, request a newsletter or mailing list membership, and apply for a job.</li>\n<li>PIR may also obtain data from sources such as cookies, third-party website analytics and ad platforms (Google), publicly available datasets, and third-party data analysis.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>1.\nRegistrants</strong>\n<p>PIR accepts domain name registrations only from ICANN-accredited domain name registrars.\nPIR does not accept domain name registrations directly from registrants.\nWhen you register a domain name through a registrar, the registrar collects information (in accordance with their ICANN accreditation and ICANN contract requirements and discloses it to PIR (Registration Data or WHOIS Data)).\nRegistrant data is not collected at the registry level by PIR.\nInformation may be collected from the registrant, a nominated administrative domain contact, technical contact, or billing contact.\nThis Notice defines \u201cregistrant\u201d or \u201cyou\u201d as these persons.\nRegistrars then pass the registrant data to PIR as required by our contracts with ICANN to fulfill our requirements and service as a registry operator to register and maintain the domain name.\nA list of registration data received and processed by PIR:</p>\n<p>Domain Name:<br>\nRegistrant ID:<br>\nRegistrant Name:<br>\nRegistrant Organization (optional input)<br>\nRegistrant

a domain name.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>2.\nWebsite Users</strong>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>a.\nUser</u>\n<u> Information</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>You may visit PIR websites without identifying yourself.\nIf you are interested in our services (other than registering a domain name, which must be done through an accredited registrar) or wish to subscribe to our newsletter, you may be required to register with PIR.\nWhen you register, we may request certain personal data, including your name, address, e-mail address and other personal data.\nIn addition to website registration, PIR may request personal data for purposes such as the provision of customer service, service offerings, network management, surveys, and other exchanges of information.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>b.\nCookies</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>A cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to your hard drive when you visit the site.\nA cookie file can contain information that allows PIR to track the pages you have visited.\nPIR uses cookies to tell when a user is a repeat visitor and to let us know how the user found the website.\nCookies also allow us to automatically link users to their personalized accounts (should you choose to register with PIR), enabling you to enter various services as a member and to visit member-restricted areas of the site without having to log in each time.\nThis applies to the use of cookies by PIR and does not apply to the use of cookies or other tracking technologies used by any third parties.</p>\n<p>Visitors to our sites have the option to disable cookies via their browser preferences or through www.allaboutcookies.org.\nYou can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser (Google Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox).\nHowever, PIR maintains a legitimate interest in using cookies, as some portions of our website and services will not work if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.\nThis applies to the use of cookies by PIR and does not apply to the use of cookies or other tracking technologies used by any third parties.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>c.\nAnalytics</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>PIR utilizes third-party data analytics for our website (Google) (i.e., cookies, log files, usage data, IP address, browser, and click stream data) to track general website performance.\nHowever, all website analytic data is aggregate and anonymous.\nThird-party data analytics platforms have access only to aggregate anonymous data.\nPIR also uses general performance data from third-party ads and may use that data to analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of our website design, services, marketing, and campaigns.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>d.\nThird-party Links</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>This Privacy Notice only addresses the processing of personal data you provide to PIR via this website.\nThe processing of any data you disclose to other parties via third-party links will be governed by their privacy policies.\nIn some cases PIR will use a software/host to administer services (e.g., .ORG Impact Award entries).\nThese services may require use of their own cookies and analytics to provide the service.\nUsers should be aware of their personal privacy settings when using platforms and apps and update them to manage your privacy preferences.\nPIR is not responsible for the privacy policies of other websites.\nWe encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of other websites you visit.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>e.\nUser generated content</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>PIR is not responsible for maintaining as confidential any personal or other data posted by you on message boards hosted by our websites.\nUsers voluntarily disclosing such personal data makes your information publicly available.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>f.\nLog files</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>PIR gathers information about all users collectively, such as what areas of its site\u2019s users visit most frequently and what services users access most often.\nThis data is logged and aggregated so we may use it to understand user behavior and for system-performance monitoring.\nPIR does not maintain individual log file data and only maintains aggregate user statistics which are not capable of identifying an individual.\nPIR may disclose aggregated user statistics to describe the service to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties and for other lawful purposes.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>g.\nThird-party advertisement</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>PIR may utilize third-party ads (Google, Facebook, Instagram).\nIn general, PIR receives only general ad performance data and does not receive any personal data from the third-party ad platform, however, PIR does employ lead generation within ads where the user is given the option to provide informed consent to receive an email contact for a specific and limited purpose.\nThe user may still engage with the ad and service without providing any personal information and the third-party does not receive any of the personal data.\nAny data, other than lead generation in ads, received by PIR via third-party ad platforms will be aggregate and anonymous.\nPIR does not use personal data to target ads, however, third-party advertisers may use data you submit to them to provide advertisements.\nIn order to control your advertisement preferences as part of third-party platforms, you must update your account settings in those platforms or in your browser.\nPIR takes care to structure any online advertisements to not target any individual natural person, not perpetuate any stereotype or social segregation, be fair and not create discrimination by denying natural persons access to employment opportunities, services, or target them with any risky financial ventures or services.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>h.\nChildren</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>Please note that we do not knowingly solicit information from children, and we do not knowingly market our products or services to children.\nIf you have reason to believe anyone under the age of 18 has provided PIR with any personal data, please contact us at privacy@pir.org.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>i.\nSensitive Personal Information</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>Similarly, PIR dos not ordinarily or knowingly require or collect sensitive personal information (information specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origins, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or information specifying sex life of an individual.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>3.\nEmployment Data</strong>\n<p>During the interview, hiring, and onboarding process, PIR will process personal data applicants and employees provide to PIR in order to fulfill PIR\u2019s employer obligations to employee and/or job applicants as outlined in its Human Resources Policies, including its Employee Data Notice.</p>\n<p>The data collected for employment purposes will not be used by PIR for any other purpose.\nPIR will only retain employment information for as long as is required by applicable law.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns about employment data please feel free to contact Human Resources hr@pir.org or the Privacy Office at privacy@pir.org.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>III.\nPurpose for Using Personal Data</strong>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>PIR will make all reasonable efforts to ensure that personal information is processed only for the purposes set out below (including to provide the services requested by you and to fulfill PIR\u2019s contracts with ICANN).\nWe will make all reasonable efforts to ensure that personal information is not further processed in a way incompatible with the purpose for which it was collected or received.\nPIR will only disclose this information, or elements of this information, in certain defined situations defined below in the Data Sharing and Disclosure.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>1.\nDomain Name Registration</strong>\n<p>PIR uses the information provided by registrars to effect domain name registrations and to maintain the security and stability of our TLDs to ensure continued and reliable function to domain name users.\nto conduct analysis in order to optimize our service to you.\nand investigate and mitigate abuse in line with PIR\u2019s Abuse Policy.\nIn addition to ensuring the secure and stable registration and operation of your domain name, PIR may use registration data to improve our services, promotions, and systems and to develop and collect aggregate anonymous statistics related to PIR\u2019s systems and services.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>2.\nWHOIS</strong>\n<p>PIR is required by our ICANN contracts to maintain a public searchable WHOIS or RDDS lookup for domain names in our TLDS.\nTo that end, PIR will display all non-personal registration information publicly via both web-based WHOIS or RDDS lookup and a Port 43 WHOIS service.\nPIR will retain and maintain the full set of registration information provided by registrants upon registration of a domain name.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>3.\nWebsite &amp.\nThird-party Ad Information</strong>\n<p>If you submit personal data to PIR through our website, we may use that information to assist with the functionality of the website.\nThis may include sending you information you have requested to receive (i.e.\nnewsletters, emails from lead generation ads) and providing you with policy and services updates.\nBe aware that any information you voluntarily provide via message boards or public discussion tools becomes publicly available information and may be used by PIR or others.</p>\n<p>PIR collects aggregated anonymized data from visitors to our websites via third-party data analytics (Google) (i.e.\ncookies, log files, usage data, IP address, browser, click stream data, etc.) as well as general performance data from any third-party ads and may use that data to analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of our website design, services, marketing, and campaigns.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>4.\nOnGood</strong>\n<p>Because .ngo and .ong are validated TLDs, meaning that only confirmed non-governmental organizations may register these domain names, PIR will use the registration information we receive from registrars, as well as additional credential information provided by the registrant organization, to complete validation and audit processes as required by our ICANN contracts.\nMembership in OnGood is optional, however, membership requires a contact to enter personal data, including name, address, e-mail address, and other personal data.\nFor more information about registration requirements for .ngo and .ong refer to Policies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>5.\nEmployment Data</strong>\n<p>PIR will process employee information in order to fulfill PIR\u2019s employer obligations as outlined in its Human Resources Policies.\nDuring the job application process PIR may collect applicant information in order to evaluate and contact candidates.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>IV.\nLawful Bases for Processing Personal Data</strong>\n<p>PIR processes your personal data: (a) based on the performance of a contract to which you are a subject or (b) where we have a legitimate business interest in doing so.</p>\n<p>When a person requests and registers a domain name through a registrar, they agree to a domain name registration contract.\nIn order to provide the requested domain name registered in a person\u2019s name (or in the name of the organization), PIR as a registry, must use the information received from the registrar to effect a domain name registration and ensure domain name function throughout the registration period.</p>\n<p>PIR may also have a legitimate interest in using personal data that is provided by you in order to optimize our service to you and your experience on our Website.\nPIR may also use third-party data providers to process data in the use of their services to provide online advertisement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>V.\nData Sharing and Disclosure</strong>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>1.\nPartners and Service Providers</strong>\n<p>Our trusted processors (vendors, subcontractors, and other similar business partners) are responsible for processing some of the personal data that we receive.\nTherefore, PIR discloses some personal data as received from your registrar to our processors.\nThese processors are not authorized to use such personal data for purposes beyond those specified by us and to the extent that they process any personal data they are required to provide security and privacy protections in line with PIR\u2019s Privacy Policy and in compliance with applicable privacy and data protection laws.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>a.\nWHOIS and Registration Data</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>PIR only requires the registrars to disclose to us the registration data dictated by ICANN as necessary for the registration and maintenance of a domain name.\nICANN requires the maintenance of both web-based WHOIS access and Port 43 WHOIS access.\nThe below shows the non-personal data that PIR will make publicly available via PIR\u2019s web-based WHOIS portal and Port 43 access pursuant to the redaction requirements in ICANN\u2019s Interim Registration Data Policy for gTLDs.</p>\n<p>Domain Name: example.tld<br>\nRegistry Domain ID: D13664-LRMS<br>\nRegistrar WHOIS Server:<br>\nRegistrar URL: www.example.tld<br>\nUpdated Date:

can identify any individual.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>b.\nData Escrow Provider </u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>PIR is required by its contracts with ICANN to escrow all the registration data PIR receives from registrars by providing a copy to a trusted third party (Data Escrow Providers).\nThe Data Escrow Providers are accredited by ICANN and are tasked with securely holding the data.\nThey are not authorized to process the data for any other purpose.\nIn the event of a registry technical failure, the securely held data will be used to ensure the continued functionality of registered domain names.\nThis backup mechanism is a protective measure that ensures the continued stable and secure operation of the DNS.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>c.\nDonuts</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>While PIR is the registry operator for the ..org, .ngo, .ong, .gives, .charity, .foundation, .\u673a\u6784, .\u0938\u0902\u0917\u0920\u0928, .\u043e\u0440\u0433 domains, we contract Donuts Inc.\nto be our technical backend registry services provider.\nTo make the chosen domain name a functional address on the Internet, PIR discloses data to TLD server administrators for the purpose of ensuring that the domain name bundle operates as a functional address on the Internet.\nAs a processor, Donuts receives registrant information solely for the purpose of processing the information on behalf of PIR to perform the technical functions to effect domain name registrations.</p>\n<p>PIR also uses Donuts as its third-party technical backend provider for OnGood, which is a community of verified .ngo and .ong domains.\nPIR shares information with Donuts so that it can maintain the functionality of .ngo and .ong domains, deliver service features to the registrant, conduct and complete the registrant validation and audit processes as required by our ICANN contracts, and maintain a credentials database.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>d.\nSharing the information we collect on our website &amp.\nvia third-party ad platform (Google, Facebook, Instagram)</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>The information that you supply to PIR through this site, OnGood, or through a promotional program conducted by PIR will never be given, sold, rented, loaned, or otherwise disclosed to any third parties outside of PIR, except where outlined above or under special circumstances.\nThird-party ad providers (Google, Facebook, Instagram) may have access to data that PIR does not control or share and is subject to the third-party\u2019s privacy policies and is not governed by PIR.\nOur Exceptions and Special Circumstances Policy (below), permits PIR to share information when it is necessary to comply with legal process or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of PIR, its customers, or the public.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>e.\nLinks and third-party collection</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>This Privacy Notice only addresses the processing of personal data we collect from you.\nThe processing of any data you disclose to other parties will be governed by their privacy policy.\nUsers should be aware of their personal privacy settings when using platforms and apps and update them to manage your privacy preferences.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>f.\nTraffic Data</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>PIR is authorized by our contracts with ICANN to make use of \u201ctraffic data\u201d for a variety of purposes (the relevant registry contract provision can be viewed here.\nSec.\n3.1(f)).\nPIR makes use of traffic data for technical purposes to enhance security and stability in its operations.\nPIR may make use of such data for purposes connected with the sale of domain names provided that such use does not involve collection or dissemination of personally identifiable
