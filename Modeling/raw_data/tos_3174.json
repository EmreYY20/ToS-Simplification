through your web browser for record-keeping purposes.\nSome cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site and Service.\nThere are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>\n<i>Session Cookies</i>\n</b>.\nSession cookies exist only during an online session.\nThey disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer.\nWe use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Site.\nThis allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.</p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>\n<i>Persistent Cookies</i>\n</b>.\nPersistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or

you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future.\nThe Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.\nVisitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local Storage Objects<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>We may use Flash Local Storage Objects (\u201cFlash

cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser.\nFor more information</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p> on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for

other information we learn about you to serve targeted advertising on your devices and to send you emails.\nTo opt-out of cross-device advertising, you may follow the instructions set forth in the

may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing.\nAlso, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective.\nAdditional information is available on NAI\u2019s and

cookies\u201d.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Cookies</b>\n</p>\n<p>Cookies are text files embedded in a web page that contain small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a Site or embedded in a web page.\nCookies may then be sent back to the originating Site on each subsequent visit, or to another Site that recognises that cookie.\nCookies are useful because they allow a Site to recognise a user\u2019s device and to remember your actions and preferences (such as login details, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time.\n</p>\n<p>Where possible, security measures are put in place to prevent unauthorised access to our cookies and similar technologies.\nA unique identifier ensures that only we and/or our authorised service providers have access to cookie data.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Web beacons</b>\n</p>\n<p>Web beacons (also known as internet tags, pixel tags, and clear GIFs) are typically transparent graphic images placed on a site or email.\nWeb beacons are used in combination with cookies to learn about our visitors` interactions, capture visitor\u2019s journey on our Site, to create segment categories and behaviour patterns, or to serve targeted advertisements.\nWe (or the third parties we use) use beacons to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, and the type of browser used to view the page.</p>\n<p>\n<b>IP addresses and URLs</b>\n</p>\n<p>An IP address is a unique identifier that certain electronic devices used to identify and communicate with each other on the internet.\nWhen you visit our Site, we (or the third parties we use) may view the IP address of the device that you use to connect to the internet using a web beacon.\n</p>\n<p>We (or the third parties we use) use only the redacted part of the IP address to determine the broader physical location of the device so that we can`t identify your precise location.\nThis helps us to understand from what geographic regions (e.g.\ncity, province, country, like Slough, United Kingdom) our Site visitors come in order to change the way we present our Site to you, to enhance your visit or to customize our marketing content.\nIf we want to collect&nbsp;your precise location data for our advertising purposes, we obtain your consent to this.\n</p>\n<p>A URL (uniform resource locator) is a unique identifier or address for each resource on the internet, in effect it is the address for the web page that you are visiting.\nWe use this information to see which sites and pages are visited and the way that you navigate through our Site.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Device IDs </b>\n</p>\n<p>Device IDs are distinctive numbers associated with a smartphone or similar handheld device from which the internet can be accessed.&nbsp;We use device IDs for the same purposes for which we use cookies, as described in this policy.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Device fingerprinting</b>\n</p>\n<p>Device fingerprinting is a way to combine certain attributes of a device e.g.\nits operating system, the type and version of browser being used, language settings and IP addresses etc which are used together to identify unique devices.&nbsp;To the extent that fingerprinting is used, we use it for the same purposes for which we use cookies.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<u>How w</u>\n</b>\n<b>\n<u>e use cookies?</u>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>We use different types of cookies on our Site for various purposes set out below.</p>\n<p>Some of these
