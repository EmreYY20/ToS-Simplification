read on for more details!</p> What information EthicalAds collects and why\nInformation from website browsers\n<p>If you're <strong>just browsing our website</strong> or just browsing a site running ads from our ad network, we collect the same basic information that most websites collect.\nWe use common internet technologies, such as web server logs.\nWe collect this basic information from everybody, whether they have an account or not.</p>\n<p>The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the visitor's browser type</li>\n<li>language preference</li>\n<li>referring site</li>\n<li>the date and time of each visitor request</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We collect this information to better understand how our website visitors use EthicalAds, and to monitor and protect the security of the website.</p>\n<p>We analyze potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses although we generally do not store this information.\nIt is used in real-time for geo-targeting advertising and fraud prevention.\nLogs containing IP addresses are deleted after no more than 10 days.</p>\nInformation from users with accounts\n<p>If you <strong>create an account</strong> as publishers who display our ads or advertisers buying ads do, we require some basic information at the time of account creation.\nYou will create your own password, and we will ask you for a valid email account.\nYou also have the option to give us more information if you want to, and this may include \"User Personal Information.\"</p>\n<p>\"User Personal Information\" is any information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify him or her.\nInformation such as a user name and password, an email address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of \"User Personal Information.\"</p>\n<p>User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information.\nWe may use aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate, improve, and optimize our website and service.</p> What information EthicalAds does not collect\n<p>We do not intentionally collect <strong>sensitive personal information</strong>, such as personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation.\nIf you choose to store any Sensitive Personal Information on our servers, you are responsible for complying with any regulatory controls regarding that data.</p>\n<p>For publishers where we make a payment, we may need to collect tax information which may contain social security numbers or other User Personal Information as required by law.</p>\n<p>If you're a <strong>child under the age of 13</strong>, you may not have an account on EthicalAds.\nEthicalAds does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 13.\nIf we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 13, we will unfortunately have to close your account.</p> How EthicalAds uses your

Generally, the remainder of the processing of User Personal Information we perform is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interest, for example, for legal compliance purposes, security purposes, or to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of EthicalAds' systems, Website, and Service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you would like to request deletion of data we process on the basis of consent or if you object to our processing of personal information, please contact privacy@readthedocs.org.</p> How we share the information we collect\n<p>We <strong>do

that requires your information.</p>\n<p>We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition of corporate entities or business units.\nIf any such change of ownership happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of User Personal Information, and we will notify you on our Website or by email before any transfer of your User Personal Information.\nThe organization receiving any User Personal Information will have to honor any promises we made in our Privacy Statement or Terms of Service.</p>\n<p>We may share User

payouts to publishers, the publisher can choose the payment method from a supported list including PayPal, OpenCollective, or others.\nThose providers will process payments.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Site

tracking\nDo Not Track\n<p>EthicalAds supports Do Not Track (DNT) and respects users' tracking preferences.\nSpecifically, we support the W3C's tracking preference expression and the EFF's DNT Policy although our site and ad network function identically regardless of this preference.</p>\n<p>For EthicalAds, this means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We <strong>do not</strong> do behavioral ad targeting regardless of your DNT preference.\nWe target advertising exclusively based on geography and the content of the page.</li>\n<li>Regardless of DNT preference, our logs that contain IP addresses and user agent strings are deleted after 10 days unless a DNT exception applies.</li>\n<li>Our full DNT policy is available here.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more details about DNT, visit All About Do Not

practices\n<p>\n<strong>Information that we collect will be stored and processed in the United States</strong> in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nHowever, we understand that we have users from different countries and regions with different privacy expectations, and we try to meet those needs.</p>\n<p>We provide the same standard of privacy protection to all our users around the world,

with Us </li>\n</ul> Publisher Policy <p>Effective date: <strong>August 19, 2020</strong>\nLast updated: March 22, 2022</p>\n<p>The goal of this page is to set expectations between EthicalAds and our publishers about what is expected for each of us.\nOur goal is for these to be easily understandable and fair,\nbut we're always happy to have feedback on these terms.</p>\n<p>All publishers agree that their ad display meets these terms prior to enabling paid ads on their site.\nWe will do an initial review of the ad display,\nbut we expect publishers to stay within these guidelines at all times.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Contents</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ad display</li>\n<li>Payouts</li>\n<li>Ad display validation</li>\n<li>Violations</li>\n</ul> Ad display\n<p>We have the following rules around display of our ads:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our ad should be the only ad network visible when loaded.\nWe currently only allow a single EthicalAds ad per page, but are discussing how to support multiple.\nPromotion of your own content or services on your site is fine, you just can't run be using other ad networks at the same time.\nIt's also fine to show our ad and other ad networks on alternating requests, just not on the same page load.</li>\n<li>The ad should appear when the user first visits, above the fold, on both desktop and mobile.\nYou can disable the ad on mobile if this isn't possible.</li>\n<li>The ad should not disrupt the natural reading flow of the page.\nIt should be placed above, beside or below the main content, not within it.\nThis is an Acceptable Ads requirement, and something we think is best for users as well.</li>\n<li>The ad placement should result in at least a .1% CTR (click-through rate).\nThis will be reported in your publisher dashboard.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You are welcome to display a different ad as a fallback if EthicalAds doesn't have a paid ad to show.\nYou are also welcome to show EthicalAds to a share of your visitors (eg.\n50%) along with another ad network, as long as they aren't shown on the same page.</p>\nPayouts\n<p>We currently have a <strong>70% revenue share</strong> with publishers\nwhich is around industry standard but slightly higher.\nThis means you get 70% of the money that we make.</p>\n<p>We handle payouts once a month,\nwith a minimum payment of <strong>$50</strong>.\nOur goal is to get payment to our publishers by the 15th of the month,\nwith the payment being the balance at the end of the prior month.</p>\n<p>We currently support payouts via the following methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stripe Connect (Bank transfer)</li>\n<li>Paypal</li>\n<li>OpenCollective</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For our compliance and for tax purposes, we may require a government ID from you\nin certain circumstances to process payouts.\nWe will ask for this explicitly if and when we require it.\nWe handle your information securely and it is deleted\nno later than 30 days after your next payout.</p>\nAd display validation\n<p>We reserve the right to validate that the traffic on your site looks authentic.\nPrior to issuing payouts,\nwe will review all traffic for each publisher,\nand alert the publisher if we find any traffic that looks inauthentic.</p>\n<p>We already invalidate different types of traffic automatically,\nwhich won't be counted as a paid ad view:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Known bot user-agents</li>\n<li>Users with IP addresses we can't geolocate</li>\n<li>Users with IP address that map to known hosting providers, VPN's, and web proxies</li>\n<li>Multiple views of an ad within 5 seconds from the same browser</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are regularly tweaking our ad fraud detection in response to new challenges,\nand we're happy to work with publishers to make sure our ads work for them.</p>\nViolations\n<p>We reserve the right to adjustment payouts contingent on following our publisher policy.\nIf traffic is found to be fraudulent, invalid, or otherwise against our policy,\nwe will attempt to detect this prior to paying out to our publishers.\nPayouts may be delayed in cases where we detect suspicious activity,\nbecause once a payout has been issued it will be very difficult to revoke.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Publishers who are found in violation of our publisher policy can have their paid ads disabled.</strong>\nWe try to provide at least 7 days notice before disabling paid advertising,\nbut this may not be possible in all cases.</p> Get our stories delivered <p>Want more advertising
