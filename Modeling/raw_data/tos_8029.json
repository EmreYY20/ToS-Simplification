Inc.\n(\u201cSNI\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d) operates the TeacherVision\u00ae service available at www.teachervision.com (\u201cSite\u201d).\nThese terms (\u201cSubscription Terms\u201d) govern your purchase of a paid term-based subscription providing you access to premium portions of the Site including related items or services (\u201cSubscription\u201d).\nPlease read these Subscription Terms carefully before purchasing a Subscription.\nSNI may update these Subscription Terms periodically and will note the new effective date if any changes are made.\nIf we make material changes to these Subscription Terms, we may choose to notify you by posting a notice, but we encourage you to review these Subscription Terms frequently and to make note of the latest \u201ceffective date.\u201d Your continued use of the Site after any changes to the Subscription Terms are posted signifies your agreement to such changes.\nIf you do not agree to these Subscription Terms, you must discontinue using the Site.\nYour use of the Site is also governed by the Site\u2019s general Terms of Use as posted and updated from time to time.</p>\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Subscription Fees.\nIn consideration for the Subscription, you agree to pay the Subscription fees (including for any renewal terms) on time and in full, and you further agree that we may charge you for the same on the credit card account or other billing information provided by you during the registration process (or as updated by you thereafter on the Site).\nYou represent to us that all payment and other information provided by you in connection with your Subscription is and will be true, accurate, current, and complete at all times.\nIf you fail to pay any Subscription fees payable by their due dates, or if any payment or other information provided by you is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, SNI reserves the right to terminate your Subscription and discontinue your access to the Site.\nIf you are using the Site via a free-trial Subscription, your access is limited to the online content (lesson plans, printables, resources) on the Site.\nUnless otherwise specified, you are limited to one free-trial Subscription per year.\nSubscriptions are non-transferable and non-refundable, except at SNI\u2019s sole discretion or as may be required by law.\nSNI reserves the right to change the fees charged for your Subscription, provided that such price change will not apply to the then-current term of your Subscription.</p>\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Automatic Renewal.\nAll Subscriptions are automatically renewed upon their expiration (i.e., the last day of their then-current terms) for additional renewal terms of equal duration.\nYou agree to pay the Subscription fees for each such renewal term at the then-current pricing, and that we may charge you for the same on the credit card account or other billing information provided by you during the registration process (or as updated by you thereafter on the Site).\nWe will notify you when such automatic renewal of your Subscription has occurred.</p>\n<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Cancellation.\nAll initial Subscriptions come with a 14-day money back guarantee.\nIf you are not satisfied for any reason, you may cancel your Subscription on the Site or by contacting our Customer Support Department by email at help@teachervision.com or by telephone at 800-498-3264.\nWe must receive your cancellation request on or before the 14th day after your Subscription initially starts.\nIf you decide to cancel after the 14th day of the start of your Subscription, you will not receive any refund of Subscription fees paid, but your initial Subscription will not renew for any additional terms (your Subscription will remain active until the end of its then-current term).\nFor additional information on the Subscription fees and on how to cancel your Subscription (including to avoid automatic Subscription renewals/charges), please see our FAQs on this topic.</p>\n<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Tax.\nFor certain purchases on this Site including Subscriptions, SNI may be required to collect sales, use, or similar taxes.\nIn states or regions that impose such tax, a purchase is subject to tax unless specifically exempt.\nWhere applicable, such taxes will be billed as a separate item, and you are required to and agree to pay them.\nSNI will collect any tax due as required by law unless you provide us with a valid sales tax exemption certificate.</p>\n<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Site Modifications/Discontinuance.\nSNI reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Site or any parts thereof including those you access through your Subscription.\nIn case of any scheduled temporary or permanent discontinuance of the Site, SNI will endeavor to provide reasonable advance notice to you.\nIf SNI permanently discontinues the Site generally prior to the end of the then-current term of Subscription, SNI will refund to you on a prorated basis any Subscription fees prepaid by you but unaccrued to us as of the effective date of such permanent discontinuance.\nNo refunds, partial or otherwise, will be provided for any temporary discontinuance of the Site or any parts thereof including those you access through your Subscription, including, without limitation, for emergency or routine maintenance or due to reasons beyond SNI\u2019s reasonable control.</p>\n<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Account Credentials.\nYou are responsible for and agree to maintain the confidentiality of any access credentials issued to you in connection with your Subscription.\nYou are fully responsible for all Site activities that occur under your username, password, and other credentials issued to you.\nYou may not share your Site credentials or otherwise allow another person to use such credentials to use the Site or for any other purpose.\nYou agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your Site credentials or of any other breach or suspected breach of security affecting the Site.</p>\n<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;No Resales.\nYou may not and you agree not to resell your Subscription or any use of the Site to any third party.</p>\n<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Content Storage.\nSNI assumes no responsibility for the deletion or failure to store any content including favorites, folders, or history established by you in connection with your Subscription and your use of the Site.\nSNI may, with or without notice to you, establish an upper limit on the size of any such content you are allowed to maintain on the Site.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Termination.\nYou agree that SNI may terminate your Subscription or otherwise terminate your access to the Site, if SNI believes (a) that you have breached these Subscription Terms or any other applicable terms including the Site\u2019s Terms of Use, or (b) that you have violated the rights of SNI or any third party including other Site subscribers or users.\nYou will not be entitled to any refund of any Subscription fees in the event of such termination.\nYou acknowledge and agree such termination may be affected without prior notice, and you acknowledge and agree that SNI may immediately delete any content maintained by you on the Site.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Updated on August 3, 2022</p> ADVERTISEMENT&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;REMOVE ADS
