their performance against other Neurolearning users.\nAlso, in connection with any research projects in which we participate, we may disclose performance statistics to university collaborators to evaluate, study, and improve the effectiveness of our programs or understanding of dyslexia or human cognition more generally.\nIn these situations, all data is disclosed either in aggregate form or with information that can identify you removed.\nIn addition, when we work with university collaborators, we contractually prohibit them from attempting to re-identify individuals from data that has been de-identified.</p>\n</li>\n<li> Legal Bases For Use Of Your Personal Data <p>The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal ground they rely on to use or disclose your personal data.\nTo the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To honor our contractual commitments to you: Much of our processing of personal data is to meet our contractual obligations to our users, or to take steps at users\u2019 request in anticipation of entering into a contract with them.\nFor example, we handle personal data on this basis for our paid users.</li>\n<li>Consent: Where required by law, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of your implied or express consent.\nWhere you have provided consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of the processing that was carried out prior to withdrawing your consent.\nTo withdraw your consent, please contact us at support@neuroedu.com.</li>\n<li> Legitimate interests: In many cases, we handle personal data on the ground that it furthers our legitimate interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals, such as: <ul>\n<li>Providing a safe and enjoyable user experience;</li>\n<li>Customer service;</li>\n<li>Marketing;</li>\n<li>Protecting our users, personnel, and property;</li>\n<li>Analyzing and improving our business;</li>\n<li>Managing legal issues.</li>\n<li>We may also process personal data for the legitimate interests of our research partners, such as to provide cognitive training, research, and analytics for such partners.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Legal compliance: We need to use and disclose personal data in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.</li>\n<li>To protect the vital interests of the individual or others: For example, we may collect or share personal data to help resolve an urgent safety

parties for their own marketing purposes.</p>\n</li>\n<li> When We Share Your Personal Information With Third Parties <p>We may share your personal data only in the following ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Service providers and agents</strong>\n<p>We may share your information with certain third parties selected by us to help support our operations.\nThese include, for example, services that help us process payments, analyze web traffic, send emails, and track customer support requests.\nIn addition, we may share limited personal data to third parties that help us market or advertise Neurolearning.\nThese third parties may have access to your information only for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf and we contractually require them to protect your information consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Affiliates</strong>\n<p>We may share your information with our corporate affiliates, such as entities under common ownership or control.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Business transfers</strong>\n<p>We may sell, transfer, or otherwise share some or all of our assets in connection with an actual or contemplated merger, reorganization, business transaction, or in the event of bankruptcy.\nIn such scenarios, your information may be one of the assets transferred.\nWe will post a notice or otherwise notify you and collect your consent, as may be required by law, before the information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Compliance with law and law enforcement requests, and protection of our rights.</strong>\n<p>We may disclose your information when we have a good faith belief we are required to do so by law, or in response to a subpoena, court order, or other legal mechanism.\nWe may also disclose your information when we have a good faith belief that disclosure may prevent fraud and abuse of Neurolearning or its users or protect our property rights.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Consent</strong>\n<p>We may disclose your information when we believe we have your consent to do so, such as when you contact customer support and ask us about your Account, or when we have the consent of someone we believe is authorized to consent on behalf of you, such as the individual associated with the payment method for your Account.\nIf you have expressly agreed to participate in a research study with us or with a third party that incorporates your personal data collected by Neurolearning, we also may disclose your information for the purpose of facilitating the research to which you have consented.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> Online Analytics And Tailored Advertising <p>We may use third-party web analytics services on Neurolearning, such as those of Google Analytics, Rollbar, and New Relic.\nThese service providers use the sort of technology previously described in the \"Cookies and other electronic technologies\" section to help us analyze how users use Neurolearning, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive, how often you use our app, the events that occur within our app, where the app was downloaded from, and provide certain features to you.\nThe information (including your IP address) collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service

Add-on by clicking&nbsp;<u>here</u>.</p>\n<p>If you receive email from us, we may use certain tools, such as clear GIFs to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains.\nThis data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications.</p>\n<p>We may personalize the content and advertising that you see when using Neurolearning through the use of third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on our websites, as well as other websites you visit and other applications you use.\nThe ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you provide such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you.\nThese ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and may be tailored to your interests.</p>\n<p>Also, third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via Neurolearning may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of Neurolearning in order to (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our websites and other sites and (ii) report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our websites and use of Neurolearning.\nWe also may allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick, and others) to serve tailored ads to you on Neurolearning, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access Neurolearning.\nWe also may share with third-party advertisers a hashed version of your email address, solely in non-human readable form for purposes of delivering tailored advertising.\nWe neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access Neurolearning by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties.\nThose parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below.\nIf you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the&nbsp;<u>Network Advertising Initiative\u2019s Consumer Opt-Out link</u>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<u>Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s Consumer Opt-Out link</u>&nbsp;to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs.</p>\n<p>To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the&nbsp;<u>Google Ads Settings page</u>.\nPlease note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into Neurolearning, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out of tailored advertising.\nIn that case, the ads will just not be tailored.\nAlso, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>\n</li>\n<li> Data Subject Rights And Your Choices
