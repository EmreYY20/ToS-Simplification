Inc.\nCloudTube displays information from YouTube.</p>\n<p>When you perform a query on CloudTube that requires data from YouTube, such as making a search or loading a video, your query is forwarded to YouTube.</p>\n<p>For example, when searching, YouTube receives a query for those search terms, and when watching a video, YouTube receives a page load for that video.</p>\n<p>When watching a video, your browser connects to googlevideo.com directly to request the video stream.\nThis connection, and any data stored by YouTube as a result, is subject to Google's privacy policy.</p>\n<p>All other queries are forwarded to your selected Invidious instance, which forwards them to YouTube.\nYouTube does not receive any metadata about you for these queries, only the query itself.</p>With other organisations<p>CloudTube does not share any data with other people or organisations.</p>How to delete your data<p>Visit the settings page and find the \"delete data\" section.\nRead the text.</p>\n<p>To delete your data, check \"I understand the consequences\", then click \"permanently erase my data\".</p>\n<p>This will erase all of your data from the server, and delete the unique cookie from your web browser.</p>\n<p>Released as AGPL free software.</p>Source code<ul>\n<li>Project hub</li>\n<li>Announcements</li>\n<li>Report a problem</li>\n</ul>About<ul>\n<li>Privacy
