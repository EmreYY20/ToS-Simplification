whom the personal information was sold or shared.\n</li>\n<li>the categories of personal information that we disclosed about you for a business purpose and the categories of persons to whom it was disclosed for a business purpose.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The disclosure described above will be limited to the personal information collected or used over the past 12 months.</p>\n<p>If we deliver our response electronically, the information enclosed will be \"portable\", i.e.\ndelivered in an easily usable format to enable you to transmit the information to another entity without hindrance \u2014 provided that this is technically feasible.</p> The right to request the deletion of your personal information\n<p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information, subject to exceptions set forth by the law (such as, including but not limited to, where the information is used to identify and repair errors on this Application, to detect security incidents and

discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA.\nThis means that we will not discriminate against you, including, but not limited to, by denying goods or services, charging you a different price, or providing a different level or quality of goods or services just because you exercised your consumer privacy rights.</p>\n<p>However, if you refuse to provide your personal information to us or ask us to delete or stop selling your personal information, and that personal information or sale is necessary for us to provide you with goods or services, we may not be able to complete that transaction.</p>\n<p>To the extent permitted by the law, we may offer you promotions, discounts, and other deals in exchange for collecting, keeping, or selling your personal information, provided that the financial incentive offered is reasonably related to the value of your personal information.</p> How to exercise your rights\n<p>To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your verifiable request to us by contacting us via the details provided in this document.</p>\n<p>For us to respond to your request, it\u2019s necessary that we know who you

about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative;</li>\n<li>describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity and therefore confirm the personal information in our possession actually relates to you.</p>\n<p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.\nWe will use any personal information collected from you in connection with the verification of your request solely for the purposes of verification and shall not further disclose the personal information, retain it longer than necessary for purposes of verification, or use it for unrelated purposes.</p>\n<p>If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can authorize a person registered with the California Secretary of State to act on your behalf.</p>\n<p>If you are an adult, you can make a verifiable request on behalf of a minor under your parental authority.</p>\n<p>You can submit a maximum number of 2 requests over a period of 12 months.</p> How and when we are expected to handle your request\n<p>We will confirm receipt of your verifiable request within 10 days and provide information about how we will process your request.</p>\n<p>We will respond to your request within 45 days of its receipt.\nShould we need more time, we will explain to you the reasons why, and how much more time we need.\nIn this regard, please note that we may take up to 90 days to fulfill your request.</p>\n<p>Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12-month period.\nOnly with regard to personal information collected on or after January 1, 2022, you have the right to request that we disclose information beyond the 12-month period, and we will provide them to you unless doing so proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort.</p>\n<p>Should we deny your request, we will explain you the reasons behind our denial.</p>\n<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.\nIn such cases, we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the request.\nIn either case, we will communicate our choices and explain the reasons behind it.</p> Information for Virginia

time following the instructions provided in this document.</p>\n<p>This Application uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner (so-called \u201cfirst-party\u201d Trackers) and Trackers that enable

consent\n<p>There are various ways to manage Tracker related preferences and to provide and withdraw consent, where relevant:</p>\n<p>Users can manage preferences related to Trackers from directly within their own device settings, for example, by preventing the use or storage of Trackers.</p>\n<p>Additionally, whenever the use of Trackers is based on consent, Users can provide or withdraw such consent by setting their preferences within the cookie notice or by updating such preferences accordingly via the relevant consent-preferences widget, if available.</p>\n<p>It is also possible, via relevant browser or device features, to delete previously stored Trackers, including those used to remember the User\u2019s initial consent.</p>\n<p>Other Trackers in the browser\u2019s local memory may be cleared by deleting the browsing history.</p>\n<p>With regard to any third-party Trackers, Users can manage their preferences and withdraw their consent via the related opt-out link (where provided), by using the means indicated in the third party's privacy policy, or by contacting the third party.</p> Locating Tracker Settings\n<p>Users can, for example, find information about how to manage Cookies in the most commonly used browsers at the following addresses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Chrome</li>\n<li>Mozilla Firefox</li>\n<li>Apple Safari</li>\n<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer</li>\n<li>Microsoft Edge</li>\n<li>Brave</li>\n<li>Opera</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Users may also manage certain categories of Trackers used on mobile apps by opting out through relevant device settings such as the device advertising settings for mobile devices, or tracking settings in general (Users may open the device settings and look for the relevant setting).</p> How to opt out of interest-based advertising <p>Notwithstanding the above, Users may follow the instructions provided by YourOnlineChoices (EU), the Network Advertising Initiative (US) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (US), DAAC (Canada), DDAI (Japan) or other similar services.\nSuch initiatives allow Users to select their tracking preferences for most of the advertising tools.\nThe Owner thus recommends that Users make use of these resources in addition to the information provided in this document.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Digital Advertising Alliance offers an application called AppChoices that helps Users to control interest-based advertising on mobile apps.\n</p> Consequences of denying consent\n<p>Users are free to decide whether or not to grant consent.\nHowever, please note that Trackers help this Application to provide a better experience and advanced functionalities to Users (in line with the purposes outlined in this document).\nTherefore, in the absence of the User's consent, the Owner may be unable to provide related features.</p> Owner and Data Controller <p>Interfocus, Inc--650 Castro Street Suite 120 458 Mountain View, CA 94041 United States</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Owner contact
