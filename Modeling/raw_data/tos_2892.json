After we have clarified this, we can now talk about your data that we store: When you sign up you have to enter your username and your password or you link a Google account.\nIf you connect a Google account, we save your account identifier and the email address of that account.\nYou can also optionally add an email address while signing up or in your account settings.\n<br>\n<br> Usually, your <strong>username</strong> cannot be traced back to you except if it contains your name or if you also use it on other platforms.\nBecause of that, we protect your username the same way we protect personal data.\n<br>\n<br> We only use your <strong>email address</strong> for notifications or to reset your password.\nYou receive an email with a link to reset your password, which has to be requested manually on our website.\nWe will never use your email address for a newsletter or anything like that.\nNotifications are emails with current information about your account or server, e.g.\nwhen your server is deleted for inactivity.\nYou can disable those notifications in your account settings.\n<br>\n<br> Your <strong>password</strong> is already concealed on your computer (hash) and will then be stored with more security (hash + salt) on our servers.\nSo your password will never reach our servers in plaintext and is extra secured.\n<br>\n<br> We also save the <strong>point in time</strong> of your registration to create statistics.\nBesides that, we have to keep that time to be able to prove that you have accepted this policy.\n<br>\n<br> All <strong>settings</strong> of your Minecraft server and all <strong>files</strong> that are created by your Minecraft server are saved on our servers.\nFurthermore, we send this data as a backup to your Google Drive account if you want that and have it enabled.\n<br>\n<br> Our <strong>storage system</strong> which stores the files of your Minecraft server logs all events (e.g.\nloading your files when starting the server or saving when stopping the server) together with your username or your user ID.\nThose events are saved for up to 7 days and help to identify and solve general or individual problems with our storage system.\n<br>\n<br> Furthermore, we store how many and which <strong>players</strong> are currently on your Minecraft server to display them on the website in your account and to determine statistics on the total number of players.\n<br>\n<br> Every time you <strong>start your server</strong> or a <strong>player joins</strong> your server, we collect this event together with the pseudonymised (hashed) user or player name.\nThose events are aggregated without personal data, and the individual events are deleted after 24 hours.\nThis allows us to measure how many different servers are started and how many different players join every day.\n<br>\n<br> Every <strong>request to our website</strong> is captured and stored for up to 24 hours.\nThe URL, the IP address, the session ID, the Cloudflare Ray ID and the country code provided by Cloudflare are stored.\nThis data is only used to analyse problems and especially to detect and defend against attacks.\n<br>\n<br> Besides that, we never save your <strong>IP address</strong> for the long term when you use our website.\nBut it is possible, that your Minecraft server writes your IP address and the IP addresses of other players into a log file.\nThis log file is overwritten on every start and can always be deleted by reinstalling the server.\nYou can always see your log file at https://aternos.org/log/.\n<br>\n<br> To be able to understand what happened when errors or problems occur, we save <strong>miscellaneous activities</strong> on our website in a log file, e.g.\nwhen you start your server, who enters or leaves your server, when you up- or download a world or when you change your email address or password.\nThis data will not be processed automatically.\nIt will only be used manually to solve errors or to help you.\n<br>\n<br> Some <strong>errors</strong> that can occur in our system, e.g.\ndifferent errors related to transferring files or when starting your Minecraft server are stored together with your username for up to 24 hours to detect unusual peak occurrences of those errors, to analyse those errors and to solve them.\nWho has access to your data and why?
