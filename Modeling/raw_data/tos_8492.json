to personal information collected through our Website or through e-mails sent to us.\n\u201cPersonal information\u201d means information that identifies you or other people personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us.\nThis Privacy Policy is part of and incorporated into our Website Terms of Use.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your Consent to This Privacy Policy.\nContact Us</strong>\n</p>\n<p>By using our Website, you are agreeing to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you do not consent to the

Policy.\nYou may access the current version of this Privacy Policy at any time by clicking on the link marked \u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d at the bottom of each page of our Website.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What Personal Information Do We Collect on Our Website?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Information You Volunteer.\nWe collect the personal information you knowingly and voluntarily provide when you use our Website.\nFor example, we collect the information you provide when you register on our Website, complete the \u201cContact Us\u201d or \u201cGetting Started\u201d form on our Website, or otherwise voluntarily provide information to us.\nIn addition, if you have signed up for the Mobile Citizen wireless broadband service (the \u201cService\u201d), when you complete your registration process online, the information you provide (which may include your name, billing address, credit card number, email address, or other information) may be provided directly to our Service provider and shared with Mobile Citizen.</p>\n<p>Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser.\nWe may collect information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser, such as your IP address, the address of the web page you were visiting when you accessed our Website, information on your operating system and browser, and the date and time of your visit.\nThe information we receive depends on the settings on your web browser.\nThe information provided by your browser does not identify you personally.\nWe use this non-personal information primarily to create statistics that help us improve our Website and our business.\nHowever, if you have created a user profile by registering on our Website, we may link the information provided by your browser to information that identifies you personally.\nIn addition, we may review our server logs for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into our network.\nIf we suspect criminal activity, we might share our server logs \u2014 which contain visitors\u2019 IP addresses \u2014 with the appropriate investigative authorities who could use that information to trace and identify individuals.</p>\n<p>Information Collected Using \u201cCookies\u201d and Other Web Technologies.\nLike many websites, we may use \u201ccookies,\u201d and similar technologies to collect information and manage our Website.\nA cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web server.\nCookies cannot be used to install computer programs or deliver viruses to your computer.\nWe may use cookies to collect information about the ways visitors use our Website or to facilitate your interactions with our Website.\nIf you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie

Service, for billing purposes, and for any other applicable purposes related to our business.\nWe may, from time to time, use your personal information to send you information we believe may be of interest to you.\nWe also use your personal information for security and fraud prevention purposes, to better understand our guests, to better market and advertise our services, and for other purposes as we may disclose to you at the time that we collect your personal information or to which you subsequently consent.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information? </strong>\n</p>\n<p>Related Entities and Trusted Third Parties.\nWe may share personal information collected through our Website with our current or future affiliates, subsidiaries, parent company, or related entities (collectively, the \u201cMobile Citizen Affiliates\u201d), or with companies and organizations that perform services on our behalf.\nExamples of organizations that provide services on our behalf include companies that provide data management, data storage, web hosting, or email services.\nWe will not share your information with third parties (other than Mobile Citizen Affiliates or

Information.\nMobile Citizen reserves the right to create and share aggregate reports on user demographics, Website traffic, and usage information with third parties administering advertising programs on our Website (\u201cThird Parties\u201d).\nWe may inform these Third Parties of our analyses of our server logs, including details regarding Website usage and general information about our Website users.\nHowever, such disclosures will refer only to general, aggregate usage data from these analyses \u2013 never specific identifying information.\nThis may allow these Third Parties to provide advertisements that are pertinent to our users\u2019 needs, or to provide improvements to the Service or marketing thereof.\nBecause we don\u2019t track usage patterns in a manner which can be identified to individual users, no Third Party will ever have the right to know that a specific user clicked their ad or profile.</p>\n<p>Legal Compliance and Safety.\nWe and the Mobile Citizen Affiliates may disclose the personal information collected through our Website when we or they, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to: (i) comply with the law (or a court order or

data collected by us may be transferred to another company that has acquired the assets of Mobile Citizen or any of the Mobile Citizen Affiliates, as the result of a sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution, liquidation or otherwise.\nIf such a transfer occurs, the acquiring company\u2019s use of your personal information will still be subject to this Privacy Policy, and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us (although the acquiring company may revise this Privacy Policy after the acquisition).</p>\n<p>Modifying or Deleting Your Information.\nWe respect your right to

across international boundaries.\nBy visiting our Website and communicating electronically with us, you consent to the processing, storage and transfer of your data as set out in this policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third-Party Website Privacy Practices</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our Website may contain links to third-party websites and/or databases that are not operated by us (including without limitation those operated by or for our Service provider).\nThese links are provided for your reference and convenience only and do not necessarily imply any endorsement of the activities of these third-party websites nor any association with their operators.\nWe do not control these websites and we are not responsible for their data practices.\nWe urge you to review the privacy policy posted on any websites you visit before using the websites or providing any personal information about yourself.\nWhen you complete your online registration for the Service, the data you provide may be

we will use reasonable efforts to remove such information from our databases.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Security</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Mobile Citizen uses industry-standard firewall and password-protection systems to protect its networks, and only authorized individuals have access to the personal information provided by our Website\u2019s users.\nOur security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and modified as necessary.\nHowever, please note that no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.\nAs a result, we cannot guarantee the security of the information that you
