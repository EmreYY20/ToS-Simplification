Clever\u2019s Commitment to Your Privacy <p>\n<em>Effective Date: June 23, 2023</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Clever is a proud signatory of the&nbsp;Student Data Privacy Pledge.</p>\n<p>Clever (\u201cClever,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) understands that privacy is tremendously important to our online visitors to our website (\u201cWebsite Visitors\u201d), to schools who use our Service (\u201cSchools\u201d), and to students whose information we may access on behalf of a School (\u201cStudents\u201d).\nClever provides a platform that enables Schools to securely provision the accounts with the third-party applications that they use.\nAs we describe below, Schools decide which data is integrated with Clever, and Schools are responsible for determining whether data is ever shared with applications through Clever.\nThis privacy policy applies to our website&nbsp;https://clever.com/&nbsp;and to the Clever platform (our \u201cService\u201d) and describes the steps we take to protect your data.</p>\n<p>Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our&nbsp;Terms of Use.</p>\n<p>Click on the links below to jump to each

Policy</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In certain jurisdictions, we are required by applicable data protection laws to provide different or additional disclosures relating to the processing of personal information about residents of certain countries, regions or states.\nIf you are a resident of the states of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Nevada, Virginia or Utah, or if you are located in the European Economic Area, Switzerland or the United Kingdom, Canada or Australia, please click on&nbsp;Jurisdiction-Specific Disclosures&nbsp;for additional disclosures that may be applicable to you.</p> We strive to be transparent in our data collection and use practices.\nThis is the type of personal information we may collect.\nStudent Data is used only for educational purposes at the direction of the School.\n1.\nHOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION <p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>We collect the following types of information:<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information about Schools:</strong>&nbsp;We ask for certain information when a School administrator registers a School with Clever, or if the administrator corresponds with us online, including a name, school name, school district, school email address and/or account name and password, phone number, message content, and information relating to the School\u2019s information systems.\nWe may also retain information provided by a School if the School sends us a message, posts content to our website or through our Service, or responds to emails or surveys.\nOnce a School begins using the Clever Service, we will collect content and information provided by the School through the School\u2019s use of the Service and we will keep records of activities related to the Service.\nWe use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to the features and functionality of the Service, to analyze and improve our Service offerings and functionality, and to communicate with our Schools and Website Visitors.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>If a School uses Clever IDM, Clever will also access user data from the School\u2019s identity provider to create, update, and archive user accounts in selected identity providers.\nThis may include updates to account fields and an account\u2019s membership in organizational units and groups.\nIf the School sets up Google Workspace as a destination in Clever IDM, Clever\u2019s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Student Data:</strong>&nbsp;Through the course of providing its Service to a School, Clever may have access to personally identifiable information about students (\u201cStudent Data\u201d) that is provided by the School, by the parent or guardian, or by the Student.\nDepending on the features and functionality of the Service selected by the School, a School may authorize Clever to receive Student Data from the learning application(s) provided by third-party developers that are used by the School.\nClever has access to Student Data only as requested by the School and only for the purposes of performing Services on the School\u2019s behalf.\nThe type of Student Data we collect will depend on how the School uses the Service and the learning applications which the School connects through the Service.\nIn many instances, Clever receives Student Data only from the School or its designated third parties and never interacts with the Student directly.\nIn some instances, depending on the level of Clever\u2019s Service selected by the School, the Schools may allow Students to log into the Clever Service to access third party applications that have been authorized by the School.\nIn that instance, the School provides each student with login credentials and confirms that it has obtained appropriate parental consents, as needed, before the student is permitted to access the Service.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Badges:</strong>&nbsp;As an alternative to a user name and password login, a School may choose to use the Clever Badge to authenticate Student users.\nThe Clever Badge is a QR code provided by the School to the Student (usually in the form of a laminated card or paper print-out) which recognizes a user\u2019s Clever account when the Badge is read by the camera on a Chromebook, laptop or other device.\nClever does not collect or store any image collected by the device camera.\nThe camera content is processed on the users\u2019 device and Clever only receives the tokens used for authentication.\nYou can learn more about Clever Badges&nbsp;here.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Student Data is used only for educational purposes at the direction of the School.&nbsp;</strong>We consider Student Data to be confidential and do not use such data for any purpose other than to provide the services on the School\u2019s behalf, in accordance with contractual agreements with the School.\nOur collection, use, and disclosure of Student Data is governed by our&nbsp;General Terms of Use, our&nbsp;Additional Terms of Use for Schools, and/or any other agreement with the School, by the provision of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), and applicable state laws which relate to the collection of Student Data.\nIf you are a Student or parent, please contact your School if you have questions about the School\u2019s use of technology service providers like Clever.</p>\n<p>See&nbsp;\u201cHow We Share Your Information\u201d&nbsp;below for more information on the limited ways in which we share School and Student Data.\nSee&nbsp;\u201cChildren\u2019s Privacy\u201d&nbsp;below for more information on how we collect and use the personal information of children under 13.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information about Parents:</strong>&nbsp;Depending on the features and functionality selected by the School, we may collect personal information about a student\u2019s parent or legal guardian (a \u201cParent\u201d) that is provided by the school or by the Parent if the Parent creates an account to access the School\u2019s Clever Service.\nPlease refer to the&nbsp;Additional Terms of Use for Parents&nbsp;to learn more about how we treat Parent personal information and accounts.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information about Others:</strong>&nbsp;We also collect personal information from Developers and other individuals who create an account, correspond with us online or otherwise use or interact with the Clever Service, including a name, contact information and information relating to the Developer business or service.\nWe may also retain information if the Developer sends us a message, posts content to our website or through our Service, or responds to emails or surveys.\nOnce a Developer begins using the Clever Service, we will collect content and information about the Developer\u2019s use of and interaction with the Service and we will keep records of activities related to the Service.\nWe use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to the features and functionality of the Service, to analyze and improve our Service offerings and functionality, and to communicate with our Developers and others.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information collected through use of the Service:</strong>&nbsp;We may collect information you provide or upload to the Service as well as activity and actions within our Service.\nFor example, we collect information from files that you upload or content you post to the Service (such as in a classroom dashboard), messages you send or receive through the Service, and content you post such as in product reviews or comments.\nIf you are a Developer, we will also collect information you make available to us when developing an Application via the Service.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information collected through technology:</strong>&nbsp;Like most websites and online services, we and our third-party partners automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit our Services, read our emails, or otherwise engage with us.\nWe typically collect this information through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, web beacons, file information and similar technology (collectively, \u201ctracking technologies\u201d).\nFor example, we collect information about your device and its software, such as your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, platform type, device type, operating system, date and time stamp, a unique ID that allows us to uniquely identify your browser, mobile device, or your account, and other such information.\nWe also collect information about the way you use our Service, for example, the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave our website, the pages you visit, the links you click, how frequently you access the Service, whether you open emails or click the links contained in emails, whether you access the Service from multiple devices, and other actions you take on the Service.\nWhen you access our Service from a mobile device, we may collect unique identification numbers associated with your device or our mobile application, mobile carrier, device type, model, and manufacturer, and mobile device operating system.\nWe may be able to determine your approximate location by analyzing other information, like an IP address to associate a user with their School.\nWe may also collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service.\nAlthough we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our visitors, we are not able to respond to Do Not Track signals from your browser at this time.<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Cookies and related technology allow us to provide you with a better user experience.\nFor example, we may use the data collected through cookies to: (a) remember information so that a user will not have to re-enter it during subsequent visits.\n(b) provide custom, personalized content and information.\n(c) identify you across multiple devices.\n(d) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service.\n(e) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and usage on our website and our Service.\n(f) diagnose or fix technology problems.\n(g) help users efficiently access information after signing in.\nand (h) otherwise to plan for and enhance our Service.\nOn certain portions of our website, we and our third party partners may also collect device and usage data for purposes of tracking adult visitors to our websites and for other targeted advertising, attribution, research and analytics purposes.\nWhile we may permit third party advertising partners to collect information from visitors to adult-directed pages of our site (such as the support pages), we do not permit third party advertising networks to collect information about authenticated users of our Service for the purpose of serving targeted advertising and we will never use Student Data for targeted advertising.<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it.\n(ii) disable existing cookies.\nor (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies.\nPlease note that doing so may negatively impact your experience using the Service, as some features and services on our Service may not work properly.\nDepending on your mobile device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies.\nYou may also set your email options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our email and performed certain functions with it.</p>\n<p>For more information about the types of tracking technologies we use and how you can control them, please see our&nbsp;Cookie Notice.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p> Student privacy is very important to us.\nStudent Data is only shared in limited circumstances \u2013 and never shared with or sold to third parties for marketing purposes.\n2.\nHOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION <p>Clever only shares personal information in a few limited circumstances, described below.\nWe do not rent or sell information for marketing purposes and we will never share or sell Student Data with third parties for marketing purposes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Who we may share information with:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We share information within the Service as needed to perform the Service and/or at the direction of the School.\nFor example, information including Student Data will be shared between and among authorized School users such as teachers and School administrators, and will be shared with third parties such as specific Developers as directed and authorized by the School.\nThis sharing will depend on the settings and functionality selected by the School.</li>\n<li>We may share information with our trusted third-party service providers who perform technology services on our behalf (e.g., web hosting and analytics services), but strictly for the purpose of carrying out their work for us.\nContractors and service providers who may have access to Student Data in the course of performing their services are subject to confidentiality and data security requirements.</li>\n<li>We may be required to share information with law enforcement or other third parties when compelled to do so by court order or other legal process, to comply with statutes or regulations, to enforce our&nbsp;General Terms of Use&nbsp;or if we believe in good faith that the disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property or personal safety of our users.</li>\n<li>We may share information in an aggregated and/or anonymous form that does not reasonably identify an individual or School.\nFor example, we may use and share aggregate or anonymized data to study and improve our Service, user functionality, and product offerings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>In the event of a change of control:</strong>&nbsp;If we sell, divest or transfer our business, we will not transfer personal information of our customers unless the new owner intends to maintain and provide the Service as a going concern, and provided that the new owner has agreed to data privacy standards no less stringent than our own.\nIn such case we will provide you with notice and an opportunity to opt-out of the transfer of personally identifiable Student Data.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How Student Data is shared:</strong>&nbsp;Other than the disclosures described above, Clever does not disclose Student Data other than as authorized and permitted by the School.\nThe Clever Service may facilitate the School\u2019s sharing of Student Data with third parties.\nFor example, some elements of our Service enable Schools to interact or communicate with parents, students, teachers and to share Student Data with designated third-party applications for the benefit of the student\u2019s education.\nClever does not facilitate the sharing of any Student Data with third parties on the Service except on behalf of the School after the School has authorized a third party or application to access Student Data through the Service.\nPlease remember that this Privacy Policy applies to the Clever Services, and not to other services or third-party applications, which have their own privacy policies.\nSchools should carefully read the privacy practices of each third-party application before agreeing to share Student Data with the third-party application through the Service.</p> We take strong measures to keep data safe and secure.\n3.\nHOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION <p>\n<strong>Storage and processing:</strong>&nbsp;Any information collected through the Service from US residents is stored in the United States.\nClever maintains strict administrative, technical, and physical procedures to protect information stored in our servers, which are located in the United States.\nAccess to information is limited (through user/password credentials and two factor authentication) to those employees who require it to perform their job functions.\nWe use industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology to safeguard the account registration process and sign-up information.\nOther security safeguards include but are not limited to data encryption, firewalls, and physical access controls to building and files.\nYou can learn more about our comprehensive security program by reviewing the&nbsp;Clever Security Practices.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Unauthorized disclosure:</strong>&nbsp;If there is any disclosure or access to any personally identifiable Student Data by an unauthorized party that compromises the security, confidentiality, or integrity of the Student Data, we will promptly notify the affected School(s) and will use reasonable efforts to cooperate with their investigation of the incident.</p> Questions about data? Here are your options.\n4.\nYOUR CHOICES ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION <p>\n<strong>Account information and settings:</strong>&nbsp;Schools may update account information and modify Services by signing into the administrator account.\nSchools and other Website Visitors can opt-out of receiving promotional email from us by clicking on the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d feature at the bottom of each email.\nSorry, you cannot unsubscribe from Service-related messaging.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about reviewing or modifying account information, contact us directly by visiting our&nbsp;Help Center.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Access to Student Data:</strong>&nbsp;Student Data is provided and controlled by the Schools.\nIf you have any questions about reviewing, modifying, or deleting personal information of a student, please contact your School directly.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How long we keep User Content:</strong>&nbsp;Following termination or deactivation of a School account, Clever may retain School profile information and content for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, or audit purposes, but any and all Student Data associated with the School will be deleted promptly.\nWe may maintain de-identified or aggregated data, including usage data, for analytics purposes.\nWe also may not be able to delete information that was previously shared with other users (such as through messages) or information previously shared with third-party applications.\nIf you have any questions about data retention or deletion, please contact us by visiting our&nbsp;Help Center.</p> We do not collect any information from students without consent.\n5.\nCHILDREN\u2019S PRIVACY <p>Clever does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age of consent in local jurisdictions) unless and until the School has obtained appropriate parental consent for the student to use the Service.\nBecause Clever collects and uses Student Data at the direction of and under the control of a School, Clever relies on each School to provide appropriate notice to parents of the School\u2019s use of third party service providers such as Clever, and for the Schools to provide consent, if necessary, and authorization for Clever to collect Student Data, as permitted by the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other applicable data protection laws.\nPlease contact us at&nbsp;trust@clever.com&nbsp;if you believe we have inadvertently collected personal information of a child without proper consent so that we may delete such data as soon as possible.</p> 6.\nLINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES AND SERVICES <p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites, applications or services linked to or from our Service.\nWe recommend that the School review the privacy policies of other applications before authorizing a third party to access data through the Service.</p> 7.\nHOW TO CONTACT US <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the Service, we recommend contacting us by visiting our&nbsp;Help Center.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Clever can be reached:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By Email:&nbsp;trust@clever.com</li>\n<li>By Phone:&nbsp;1-800-521-6516</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are not satisfied with our response, you can contact the iKeepSafe Safe Harbor Program\u2019s dedicated consumer complaint department at:&nbsp;coppaprivacy@ikeepsafe.org</p>\n<p>If a Student contacts Clever with a question about our Service, we will collect personal information from that Student only as necessary to respond to the Student\u2019s request and direct the Student to contact the Student\u2019s School, and we will then delete or anonymize the personal data of the Student after providing our response.</p> 8.\nJURISDICTION-SPECIFIC DISCLOSURES <p>We may be required by law to provide additional privacy disclosures, depending on the jurisdiction in which you reside.\nPlease refer below for disclosures that may be applicable to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>United States.</em>&nbsp;If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Nevada, Utah or

(\u201cFAA\u201d) governs the interpretation and enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement in Section 3(viii) and preempts all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law.\nIf the FAA is

courts located in Santa Clara County, California for any actions related to this Agreement.\nYou agree that Santa Clary County, California is the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an

section carefully because it requires Parents and Developers to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which they can seek relief from Clever.\n***</p>\n<p>If you are a Parent or a Developer, then this section (the \u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and Clever that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (a) this Agreement, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof.\n(b) access to or use of the Services, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications.\n(c) any transactions through, by, or using the Services.\nor (d) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with us, directly or indirectly, as a consumer (\u201cClaim\u201d or collectively, \u201cClaims\u201d).\nThe Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your agreement to this Agreement.</p>\n<p>If you are a new User, you can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days of accepting this Agreement by emailing us at legal@clever.com with your first and last name and stating your intent to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement.\nNote that opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect any other part of this Agreement, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought.</p>\n<p>For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at legal@clever.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.\nIn the unlikely event that we have not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any Claim exclusively through binding arbitration by AAA before a single arbitrator (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d), under the Expedited Procedures then in effect for AAA (the \u201cRules\u201d), except as provided herein.\nIn the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall control.\nAAA may be contacted at www.adr.org, where the Rules are also available.\nThe arbitration will be conducted in the U.S.\ncounty where you live or Delaware, unless we agree otherwise.\nIf you are using the Services for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.\nIf you are an individual using the Services for non-commercial purposes: (i) AAA may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from AAA.\n(ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.\nand (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process.\nAny judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nYou and Clever agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.\nThe Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Agreement, any provision of the Agreement, is unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.</p>\n<p>Nothing in this section shall be deemed as: preventing us from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.\nor preventing you from asserting claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances on only an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.</p>\n<p>If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall be severed.\nSeverance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall have no impact on the remaining provisions of the Arbitration Agreement, which shall remain in force, or the parties\u2019 ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver below is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction.\nAll other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement shall be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>ix) CLASS ACTION / JURY TRIAL WAIVER</strong>\n</p>\n<p>*** With respect to all Parents and Developers, regardless of whether they have obtained or used the Services for personal, commercial or other purposes, all claims must be brought in the parties\u2019 individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, collective action, private attorney general action or other representative proceeding.\nThis waiver applies to class arbitration, and unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims.\nYou and Clever agree that the arbitrator may award relief only to an individual claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief on your individual claim(s).\nAny relief awarded may not affect other users.\nYou and Clever further agree that , by entering into this Agreement, you and Clever are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to bring, join, or participate in a class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other representative proceeding of any kind as a plaintiff or class member.\n***</p>\n<p>\n<strong>x) DMCA NOTICE</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Since we respect artist and

not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by us in accordance with the terms of our&nbsp;Privacy Policy.\nThis Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Clever in connection with the Services including other agreements referenced herein, constitute the entire agreement between you and Clever concerning the Services.\nIf any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which

solely for the purpose of developing, maintaining and supporting the Data Integration in accordance with the Integration Requirements and Documentation.\nWe may, in our sole discretion, update the

Transaction is rejected for Non-Sufficient Funds (\u201cNSF\u201d), Clever may, at its discretion, process the charge again within 30 days.\nDeveloper agrees to a transaction charge of $25 for each

Use.</p> Section 1.\nYOUR ACCESS TO THE CLEVER SERVICES <p>Clever provides data integration and single sign-on functionality, making it easier for Schools to choose, deploy and control software applications made available by Developers that are used by teachers and students in the classroom.\nPlease note this service may not be available for all Schools or Parents.</p>\n<p>Depending on the

changes in advance so that you have sufficient time to evaluate the change in practice.\nOf course, you can always opt-out by deleting your account before the changes take effect.\nYour continued use of the Services after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.</p> Section 5.\nQUESTIONS <p>We hope you have the best possible experience when using our Services.\nIf you have any questions or concerns about our Services or anything in our General Terms Use, these Additional Terms for Parent Accounts, or our Privacy Policy, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact us by visiting our&nbsp;Help Center&nbsp;and we\u2019ll do our best to promptly respond to you.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p> ", "created_at": "2023-09-04 20:54:05.53714", "updated_at": "2023-09-04

for Schools <p>\n</p>\n<p>Effective Date: June 30, 2022</p>\n<p>Welcome to Clever\u2019s Additional Terms of Use for Schools (the \u201c<strong>Additional Terms for Schools</strong>\u201c).\nIf you are a School, please also review our&nbsp;General Terms of Use&nbsp;and our&nbsp;Privacy Policy.\nIf you\u2019re not a School (as defined in the&nbsp;General Terms of Use), these Additional Terms for Schools do not apply to you.</p>\n<p>Capitalized terms that are not defined below have the definitions given them in the&nbsp;General Terms of Use.</p>\n<p>By using the Services, you authorize us to access your SIS or receive Student Data or other information via SIS, Secure File Transfer Protocol (\u201c<strong>SFTP</strong>\u201c), Google Classroom integration, or any other secure transfer method to provide you software integration services.</p> SECTION 1.\nKEEPING YOUR STUDENT DATA CONFIDENTIAL (THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO US) AND COMPLYING WITH APPLICABLE LAWS <p>We treat your Student Data as confidential and do not knowingly share it with third parties other than as described in Section 2(B) and in the&nbsp;General Terms of Use&nbsp;and our&nbsp;Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>Both parties agree to uphold their responsibilities under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201c<strong>FERPA</strong>\u201c), the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (\u201c<strong>PPRA</strong>\u201c), and the Children\u2019s Online Privacy and Protection Act (\u201c<strong>COPPA</strong>\u201c).\nWe provide the Services under the school official exception of FERPA 34 CFR Part 99.31(a)(1).\nThe Children\u2019s Online Privacy and Protection Act (\u201c<strong>COPPA</strong>\u201c) requires that online service providers obtain clear and verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information from children under 13.\nYou represent and warrant that you have the authority to provide consent on behalf of parents, for us to collect information from students for the purpose of providing the Services to you as described in these Terms before allowing children under 13 to access our Services.\nWe recommend that all Schools provide appropriate disclosures to students and parents regarding their use of service providers such as Clever and that they provide a copy of our Privacy Policy to parents and guardians.</p> SECTION 2.\nAUTHORIZATION TO ACCESS YOUR STUDENT DATA <p>\n<strong>A.\nOUR ACCESS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You authorize us to access Student Data and will provide a way for us access the information stored in your SIS, for example through Secure File Transfer Protocol (\u201cSFTP\u201d), Google Classroom integration, or any other secure transfer method to provide you software integration services.\nWe will access and process Student Data only in order to provide the Services.\nAs between us, you own all right, title and interest to all Student Data, you are (and other Schools are) solely responsible for any and all Student Data, whether provided by you, students, or others, and we do not own, control, or license Student Data, except to provide the Services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>B.\nPARENT ACCESS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may provide access to Student Data to a student\u2019s parent or legal guardian (a \u201c<strong>Parent</strong>\u201c) by inviting a Parent to create a Parent account.\nYou acknowledge and agree that you, and any school official or administrative user that enables such Parent access features, will only provide Parent access to those parents or legal guardians who are authorized to access a student\u2019s educational records and that you are solely responsible for the consequences of providing access to Student Data to Parents through the Services.\nAt any time, you can limit or revoke a Parent\u2019s access to Student Data.</p>\n<p>As between us, you own all right, title and interest to all information you provide to Clever about Parents.\nHowever, if a Parent creates an account with Clever, that Parent account is owned and controlled by the Parent and is subject to the Additional Terms of Use for Parents between Clever and the Parent.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>C.\nTHIRD PARTY ACCESS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Certain Clever services enable single sign-on access to, or data integrations with, other software, applications or tools provided by third-party education technology providers or developers (\u201c<strong>Developers</strong>\u201c) that you designate to securely access Student Data via our API.\nWe will not send Student Data to any third-party Developer unless explicitly authorized by you.\nYour relationship with each Developer is governed by your independent agreement with each Developer and not by these Additional Terms of Use for Schools.\nYou acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the data practices of third-party Developers, and that, as between us, you are solely responsible for the consequences of providing or transmitting Student Data to such Developers, and authorizing those Developers to access Student Data through the Services.\nAt any time, you can revoke any Developer\u2019s ongoing access to Student Data via the API by visiting our&nbsp;Help Center.</p>\n<p>We provide access to Student Data only to those employees and certain trusted service providers who have a legitimate need to access such information in connection with providing the Services to you.\nOf course, anyone involved in the handling of Student Data will treat such data as strictly confidential and shall not redisclose such data except as necessary in order to provide the Services.\nWe will maintain access log(s) that record all disclosures of or access to Student Data within our possession and will provide copies of those access log(s) to you on your request.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>D.\nOTHER ACCESS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Access to Student Data is controlled by Schools.\nParents, legal guardians, and students can ask for their Student Data via their Schools.\nIf there are any changes that need to be made in Clever, the district will upload the new Student Data to Clever.</p> SECTION 3.\nHOW WE USE YOUR STUDENT DATA <p>\n<strong>A.\nIN GENERAL</strong>\n</p>\n<p>By submitting Student Data or other information to us, whether via the Services or otherwise, you expressly grant, and you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant, to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license during the term of these Additional Terms for Schools and our&nbsp;General Terms of Use&nbsp;to use, transmit, distribute, modify, reproduce, display, and store the Student Data only for the purposes of: (i) providing the Services as contemplated in these Additional Terms for Schools and our&nbsp;General Terms of Use, (ii) maintaining, supporting, evaluating, diagnosing and developing our Services, and (iii) enforcing our rights under these Additional Terms for Schools and our&nbsp;General Terms of Use.\nWe will not use the Student Data for any purpose except as explicitly authorized by these Additional Terms for Schools and our&nbsp;General Terms of Use.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>B.\nDE-IDENTIFIED DATA</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You agree that we may collect and use De-Identified Data to operate, analyze, improve, market or develop educational sites, services or applications and to demonstrate the effectiveness of our products or services.\nDe-Identified Data means data from which all personally identifiable information, including direct and indirect identifiers, has been permanently removed or obscured so that the remaining information does not reasonably identify an individual and there is no reasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify an individual.\nIf we share or publicly disclose De-Identified Data, that data will be aggregated or anonymized to reasonably avoid identification of a specific School or individual student.\nFor example, we may (i) track the number of School users or administrators on an aggregate basis as part of our marketing efforts to publicize the total number of Users of the Services, and (ii) analyze aggregated usage patterns for product development efforts.\nYou further agree that we may use, store, transmit, distribute, modify, copy, display, sublicense, and create derivative works of De-Identified Data even after this Agreement has expired or been terminated.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>C.RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF STUDENT DATA FOR ADVERTISING</strong>\n</p>\n<p>For clarity and without limitation, we will not use Student Data to: (i) advertise or market to students or to direct targeted online advertising to students, (ii) advertise or market educational products and services to parents/guardians, unless with consent of the parent/guardian and/or School, (iii) develop a profile of a student, parent/guardian or group, other than for the purpose of providing educational services or as authorized by School or by a parent/guardian, or (iv) for any other commercial purpose unless authorized by School or permitted by applicable law.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this section shall be read to prohibit Clever from: (a) marketing educational products and services directly to parents, guardians or School employees so long as the marketing does not result from the use of Student Data obtained by Clever from providing the Services, (b) using Student Data to recommend educational products or services to parents/guardians or School employees so long as the recommendations are not based in whole or in part by payment or other consideration from a third party, or (c) using aggregate information to inform, influence or enable marketing, advertising, or other commercial efforts, generally.</p> SECTION 4.\nDELETING STUDENT DATA AND TERMINATING YOUR ACCESS TO THE SERVICES <p>\n<strong>A.\nDELETING STUDENT DATA</strong>\n</p>\n<p>By law, a Student or Parent may have the right to request modification or deletion of Student Data.\nAll such requests should be submitted to the Student\u2019s School and not to Clever.\nUpon written request received from a School, we will delete a student\u2019s Student Data (other than De-Identified Data) in our possession at any time.\nWe will comply with the request in a commercially reasonable time not to exceed ten (10) business days (other than data residing on backups or internal logs which will be removed within sixty (60) days).\nWe may not be able to delete information that was previously shared with others through the Service, such as the content of messages.\nSimilarly, we cannot delete information previously shared with a Developer.\nIf you grant access to Student Data to a Developer and subsequently need that data deleted, you need to request such deletion directly from that Developer.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>B.\nTERMINATING YOUR ACCESS TO THE SERVICES</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Schools may, at any time and for any or no reason, terminate these Additional Terms for Schools and our&nbsp;General Terms of Use&nbsp;by providing written notice by visiting our&nbsp;Help Center, except that provisions that by their nature should survive termination will survive termination, such as provisions relating to warranty disclaimers, limitations of liability, indemnities, and governing law.</p>\n<p>Within seventy-two (72) hours of our receipt of a confirmed notice of termination or earlier if commercially reasonable to do so, we will cease accessing your SIS (and will cease any third-party Developer access you had authorized).\nWe will automatically delete or de-identify all Student Data within seventy-two (72) hours of our receipt of the termination notice, except for Student Data residing on backups or internal logs which will be removed within sixty (60) days.\nBecause the Student Data that Clever may have access to is already present in the School\u2019s SIS system, we do not provide a mechanism to return Student Data upon termination.\nAs noted above, Student Data that has previously been made available to Developers may still be in Developers\u2019 possession notwithstanding the School\u2019s termination of these Additional Terms for Schools and our&nbsp;General Terms of Use&nbsp;, and the Developer\u2019s subsequent use or deletion will be governed by any agreements between School and Developers.\nTermination of your agreement with Clever will not terminate any agreement you have with a third-party Developer.\nWe may terminate these Additional Terms for Schools and our&nbsp;General Terms of Use&nbsp;in accordance with the&nbsp;General Terms of Use.</p> SECTION 5.\nPRIVACY AND SECURITY <p>\n<strong>A.\nSTUDENT DATA</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We care deeply about the privacy and security of Student Data.\nWe maintain strict administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect Student Data stored in our servers, which are located in the United States.\nWe limit access to Student Data only to those employees or service providers who have a legitimate need to access such data in the performance of their duties.\nAll of our employees with access to Student Data are required to have passed a background check and receive annual training on how to maintain the security and confidentiality of student records.\nYou can learn more about our comprehensive security program by reviewing the&nbsp;Clever Security Practices.</p>\n<p>In the event of an unauthorized release, disclosure or acquisition of Student Data that compromises the security, confidentiality or integrity of the Student Data maintained by Clever (a \u201c<strong>Security Incident</strong>\u201c), we will promptly notify the Clever account owner of any affected Schools via email and will use reasonable efforts to cooperate with their investigations of the incident.\nTo the extent known, this notice will identify (i) the nature of the Security Incident, (ii) the steps we have executed to investigate the Security Incident, (iii) the type of Student Data affected, (iv) the cause of the Security Incident, if known, (v) the actions we have taken or will take to remediate any deleterious effects of the Security Incident, and (vi) any corrective actions we have taken or will take to prevent a future Security Incident.\nIf, due to a Security Incident caused by the acts or omissions of Clever or its agents, a notification to an individual, organization or government entity is required under applicable privacy laws, you agree that, as the owner of the Student Data, you are responsible for the timing, content, cost, and method of any required notice and compliance with those laws and Clever will indemnify Schools for all reasonable costs related to legally-required notifications.\nWith respect to a breach of a third party Developer service or application whose service is accessed through the Clever Service or any other Security Incident which not caused by the acts or omissions of Clever or its agents, Clever shall reasonably cooperate with School\u2019s investigation of the Security Incident, as School requests, at School\u2019s reasonable expense, but Clever shall not indemnify a School for costs associated with the Security Incident.\nClever shall be responsible for the timing, content, cost and method of notice and compliance with such laws as they relate to users that are not associated with a School account.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>B.\nDATA PROCESSING TERMS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Depending on your location, the following additional terms may apply to you.\nThese terms govern our processing of \u201cpersonal information\u201d or \u201cpersonal data\u201d (as may be defined under applicable law) on your behalf under various country data protection and privacy laws.\nPlease refer below to the additional terms that may be applicable to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Europe.</strong>&nbsp;If you\u2019re a School located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom or Switzerland, then the&nbsp;European Data Processing Addendum&nbsp;is incorporated into these Additional Terms for Schools and forms part of the Agreement.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Canada.</strong>&nbsp;If you\u2019re a School located in Canada, then the&nbsp;Canadian Data Processing Addendum&nbsp;is incorporated into these Additional Terms for Schools and forms part of the Agreement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you prefer, you can request a signed copy of the data processing addendum by contacting us at&nbsp;legal@clever.com&nbsp;and identifying the location of your School.</p>\n<p>SECTION 6: ADDITIONAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO THE CLEVER APP STORE</p>\n<p>This Section applies to your use of the Clever App Store, an online application marketplace where Developers can offer to sell subscriptions to their software applications (each a \u201cDeveloper App\u201d) for direct distribution to Schools.</p>\n<p>Your use of any Developer App made available in the Clever App Store is subject to the end user license agreement or other contract that you agree to with the applicable Developer.\nIt is also subject to the Developer\u2019s privacy policy, which we recommend requesting and reviewing carefully before purchasing any Developer App.\nClever does not have any liability under any contract between you and a Developer nor any breach by you or the Developer of any of the terms of any such contract.\nFurther, Clever does not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information made available in Clever App Store relating to the Developer Apps.</p>\n<p>You agree to pay Developers directly for your use of Developer Apps made available in the Clever App Store.\nClever may permit you to make payments via a third-party payment processor in the Clever App Store, but is not required to do so.\nYou may be required to enter into a separate agreement with the Clever App Store payment processor.\nClever has no obligation to track or process payments, authenticate paid or previously paid downloads, maintain payment records, or pay, report, or charge or collect sales, excise, value-added, or similar taxes.\nNote that Clever may separately require Developers to pay Clever to post their Developer Apps in the Clever App Store.</p>\n<p>Clever has no obligation to provide any maintenance and support services with respect to the Developer Apps.\nIf a Developer App does not perform as expected, please raise your concerns directly with the applicable Developer.\nTo the extent permitted by law, Clever makes no warranties with respect to the Developer Apps, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be solely governed by your contract with the applicable Developer.\nClever has the right to refuse to include any Developer App and/or associated content on the Clever App Store.\nIn addition, Clever may, at any time, in its sole discretion and without notice, take down or remove any Developer App or associated content from the Clever App Store.</p>\n<p>You agree that Clever is not responsible for addressing any claims of you or any third party relating to the Developer Apps or your possession and/or use of the Developer Apps, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims.\n(ii) any claim that a Developer App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement.\nand (iii) claims arising under consumer protection laws or similar laws.\nIn the event of any third-party claim that a Developer App infringes a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, the Developer, not Clever, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by your contract with the applicable Developer.</p> SECTION 7: FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS <p>You agree to pay all fees specified in an ordering document or an online order that is entered into between you and Clever (each, and \u201cOrder Form\u201d) on the payment schedule set forth in such Order Form.\nExcept as otherwise specified in an Order Form, all payment obligations are non-cancelable and fees paid are non-refundable.\nYou will provide us with either valid credit card information, a valid purchase order or alternative payment document reasonably acceptable to us.\nIf you provide us with a credit card, then you authorize us to charge such credit card for all purchased products and services listed in the Order Form(s).\nSuch charges will be made in advance, either annually or in accordance with any different billing frequency stated in the applicable Order Form.\nIf the Order Form specifies that payment will be by a method other than a credit card, then we will invoice you in advance and in accordance with the relevant Order Form(s).\nUnless otherwise stated in the Order Form, invoiced charges are due net 30 days from the invoice date.\nYou are responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to us and notifying us of any changes to such information.\nIf any amount owing by you under this Agreement or any other agreement is 30 or more days overdue, then we may, without limiting our other rights and remedies, suspend our Services to you until such amounts are paid in full.\nPrices and fees are exclusive of any federal, state, local or other taxes, which will be your responsibility, unless you provide us with proof of your tax-exempt status.\nTaxes, if any, will be listed separately on the invoice.\nUpon our request, you will provide us with a certificate or other evidence documenting your tax-exempt status.</p> SECTION 8.\nQUESTIONS <p>We here at Clever hope that you will have the best possible experience when using our Services.\nIf you have any questions or concerns about our Services or anything in our&nbsp;General Terms of Use, these Additional Terms for Schools, or our&nbsp;Privacy Policy, please don\u2019t
