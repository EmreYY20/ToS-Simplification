16 in Europe are not permitted to use our site (up from 14).\nFor other regions, the minimal age had been lowered from 14 to 13.\nOther changes are fairly minor.\nWe've added additional disclosure information in general -- particularly in regards to third party cookies and services, access to your own data, as well as further information on how we handle people that we believe are intentionally trying to misuse our systems.\nWe also added emphasis to the fact that information you upload to the site for public consumption (ie: message forums or comments added to pages or videos) can not often be deleted.\nIn such cases, we can usually assist in removing content in these posts specifically referencing your real name or contact information (except in some extremely rare cases of public warnings of alleged misdeeds by a user against other users deemed required for the protection of the community).</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<b>Introduction</b>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>\nWebMagic,

United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\"DMCA\"), we will respond expeditiously to properly completed claims of copyright infringement that are delivered to our Designated Copyright Agent, identified below.</p>\n<p>\nThis page describes the process of submitting a DMCA claim to us.\nIt is designed to make alleged infringement notices to us as straightforward as possible and, at the same time, minimize the number of notices we receive that are spurious or difficult to verify.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe will take whatever action, in our sole discretion, we deem appropriate, including removing or disabling access to challenged material and/or in appropriate circumstances and at our discretion, terminating the accounts of users who repeatedly infringe or are repeatedly charged with infringing.\nIf we remove or disable access in response to such a notice, we will attempt to notify the owner or administrator of the affected content so that he or she can make a counter notification.</p>\n<p>\nWe may send a copy of a received notice to an alleged infringer, to identified rights holders, and/or to one or more third parties (such as Chilling Effects, example) and we and/or third parties may make it, and/or information compiled from it, available to the public.\nSuch publication may redact part of the notice, most likely the submitter's personal electronic contact information (ie: phone number and e-mail address).</p>\n<p>\nIMPORTANT: Misrepresentations made in your notice regarding whether material or activity is infringing may expose you to liability for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees).\nCourts have found that you must consider copyright defenses, limitations or exceptions before sending a notice.\nIn one case involving online content, a company paid more than $100,000 in costs and attorney fees after targeting content protected by the U.S.\nfair use doctrine.\nAccordingly, if you are not sure whether material available online infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.</p>\n<br>\n<b>* FAILURE TO PROPERLY INCLUDE ALL OF THE FOLLOWING REQUESTED INFORMATION WILL RESULT IN A REJECTION OF OR A DELAY

users, and as such, you need to further identify which elements you are referring to.\nAdditionally, differences in page view pagination may make simple URL identification insufficient.\nFor example, a message forum thread page may contain a variable amount of individual posts dependent on the method used to view the page and the individual settings of the browser viewing the page.\nWhenever possible, identity any references to real name or username associated with the infringing material along with, whenever possible, any identifying date and time stamps associated with it.\nPlease describe what part of the post or page is objectionable.\nFor example, if it is an external link, please specify the link.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<br>\n<b>\n<u>Notices - Suggestions on Wording to Avoid</u>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nMuch of the content on our sites is created by others.\nOccasionally notices may be prepared by the uninitiated that threaten us, the online service provider, and accuse us directly of specific or vague allegations by a preparer unhappy with the actions of one of our users.\nEven though the DMCA and the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act (OCILLA) is intended to protect online service providers and discourage such frivoulous claims, notices may arrive that make such claims anyway.\nBesides challenging your credibility, any such letters received will likely be referred to our outside counsel, complicating the process of resolution and increasing the time required to respond to your concerns.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<b>\n<u>Sending Notice - DMCA: Designated Agent:</u>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You may send DMCA notices to 'dmcaagent@webmagic.com' or written notification via regular mail (postal mail, FedEx, or UPS) to the following address.\nPlease note that, due to security concerns, attachments cannot be accepted.\nAccordingly, any notification of infringement submitted electronically with an attachment will not be received or processed.\nPlease note that due to spam filters and other flaws in email, it would be improper to assume we have received your email unless you have received a confirmation from us.\nIt is our goal to confirm the receipt of such email within 72 hours of arrival.\nIf you do not receive such a confirmation, please email us again or contact us at the address below:<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;WebMagic, Inc.\n- DMCA Department<br>Attn: Copyright Manager<br>530 S.\nLake Ave.\nSte.\n450<br>Pasadena, CA 91101<p>\n<br>\n<b>\n<u>Counter-Notification Policy</u>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nTo be effective, a Counter-Notification must be a written communication by the subscriber or user provided to our Designated Agent (as set forth above) that includes substantially the following:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.</li>\n<li>A statement under penalty of perjury that the Subscriber has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.</li>\n<li>The Subscriber's name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that the Subscriber consents to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district of California, or if the Subscriber's address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which WebMagic may be found, and that the Subscriber will accept service of process from the person who provided notification or an agent of such person.</li>\n<li>A physical or electronic signature of the subscriber.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nUpon receipt of a Counter-Notification containing the information as outlined in 1 through 4 above:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We shall promptly provide the Complaining Part with a copy of the Counter Notification.</li>\n<li>We shall inform the Complaining Party that it will replace the removed material or cease disabling access to it within ten (10) business days.\n</li>\n<li>We shall replace the removed material or cease disabling access to the material within ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days following receipt of the Counter Notification, provided our Designated Agent has not received notice from the Complaining Party that an action has been filed seeking a court order to restrain Subscriber from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on our system.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nNotices and Counter-Notices with respect to this website must meet then current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA.\nsee http://www.copyright.gov for details.\nIf you need help filing or creating a Counter-Notice, there are plenty of resources online.\nChilling Effect's Counter-Notice Generator is a well-known resource.\nAnother is the Scribd DMCA Counter Notification Template.</p>\n<p>\nIf the notice was in error or malicious, file a counter-notice as promptly as possible, even if you do not wish to have the work restored.</p>\n<p>\nIt is important to file a counter-notice if the takedown was sent in error, even if you view the takedown as not being a big deal because hosts are required to ban and delete accounts of repeat infringers.\nIf you receive too many DMCA notices, you may find your entire account disabled, even if the takedown notices were invalid.\nAs such, it is important to file counter-notices to prevent such an action from happening.</p>\n<p>\nFinally, in extreme cases where the notice was false and filed knowingly so, the subscriber/user can file suit against the filer for damages including attorney's fees and court costs.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<b>\n<u>Repeat Infringers</u>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nInfringement of the copyrights of others violates our Terms of Services.\nAdditionally, the DMCA requires service providers to terminate the access of 'repeat infringers'.\nIt is our policy to ban or terminate accounts after 3 to 5 uncontested DMCA notices or determinations by a court of competent jurisdiction in a two (2) year period, only counting determinations that refer to alleged infringement that occurred after a previous notice or determination had been delivered to an alleged infringer.\nAdditionally, we reserve the right to terminate an account earlier than that, and to take other actions including temporarily locking or banning an account for a specified period of time (i.e.: a month or a year).\nIt is exceedingly rare for us to receive a complaint about one of our users, and we don't recall ever receiving a second one on a user.\nAs such, much of this policy is likely to be only theoretical.</p>\n<p>\nOur policies are inspired by the DMCA law itself, the policies of other services providers, and proposals posted on the web site of The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) which encourages a fair use policy giving plenty of notice to alleged infringers, information on preparing counter-notices, \"no instant termination\" and a system geared around \"trust.\" It proposes \"additional protections for 'trusted users', such as users who have not posted any infringing material for a specific amount of time, or for whom noticed content represents only a small percentage of their total posts.\nSuch protections could include additional 'strikes' before termination (say, five rather than three), and a fast-tracked appeal procedure.\"</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<b>\n<u>Cautions</u>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe DMCA process, whether on the filing or receiving end, should never be taken lightly as missteps could, and often do, have very serious legal implications.\nIf in doubt, consult an attorney.</p>\n<p>\nAdditionally, many disputes may be quickly resolved and misunderstandings easily avoided by simply contacting the originator of content you find objectionable, informing them that you feel your rights are being infringed, and requesting that such content be immediately changed or removed or other accomodation made.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\u00a9 2013 All Rights Reserved.<p>\n</p>", "created_at": "2023-03-14 01:30:02.704849", "updated_at": "2023-03-14 01:30:55.763491"}], "points": [], "urls":
