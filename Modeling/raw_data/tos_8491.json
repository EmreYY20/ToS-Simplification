unenforceable, the Agreement will be construed as if such provision had not been included.\nNeither party may assign this Agreement without the prior, written consent of the other party, except that either party may assign this Agreement without such consent in connection with an acquisition of the assigning party or a sale of all or substantially all of its assets.\nIn the event of an assignment by Customer in connection with an acquisition of Customer or a sale of all or substantially all of Customer\u2019s assets, Customer\u2019s License may be transferred to the party acquiring Customer or purchasing all or substantially all of its assets, subject to Verkada\u2019s prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.</p>\n<p>A party will not be liable for any failure to perform caused by circumstances beyond its reasonable control which would otherwise make such performance commercially impractical including, but not limited to, acts of God, fire, flood, acts of war, pandemics, government action, accident, labor difficulties or shortage, inability to obtain materials, equipment or transportation (each, a \u201c&nbsp;<b>Force Majeure Event</b>\u201d).\nIf a Force

arbitrator administered by JAMS, its successors and assigns, in San Mateo County, California, unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, and pursuant to its arbitration rules.\nEach party will be responsible for paying any arbitration fees in accordance with the foregoing rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator may include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.\nAny judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nNothing in this Section shall be deemed to prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of its data

https://www.verkada.com/support/sla/.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>EXHIBIT BAlarms Addendum<p>This \u201c&nbsp;<b>Alarms Addendum</b>\u201d sets forth the terms applicable to Customer\u2019s use of the Monitoring Services (as defined below).</p>1.&nbsp;<u>Certain Definitions</u>.<p>\n<b>a.</b>&nbsp;\u201c&nbsp;<b>Alarm</b>(s)\u201d means an alarm signal, data, video or audio transmission initiated by the Hardware installed on Customer\u2019s premises signaling a specific type of situation that is transmitted to a Call Center for response via the Hosted Software.</p>\n<p>\n<b>b.</b>&nbsp;\u201c&nbsp;<b>Call Center</b>(s)\u201d means a central monitoring station that receives and responds to an Alarm for Customer as more fully set forth below.</p>\n<p>\n<b>c.</b>&nbsp;\u201c&nbsp;<b>Call List</b>\u201d means the list of names, with corresponding telephone numbers and email addresses, of those persons in the order Customer wishes to receive notification of Alarms which must be created, and updated by Customer from time to time, via the Hosted Software.</p>\n<p>\n<b>d.</b>&nbsp;\u201c&nbsp;<b>First Responder(s)</b>\u201d means the entity (e.g., fire department, police department) that is contacted by the Call Center to respond to an Alarm received at the Call Center.</p>\n<p>\n<b>e.</b>&nbsp;\u201c&nbsp;<b>Monitoring Services</b>\u201d means the automated Alarm transmission functionality enabled by the Software that, when triggered, transmits an Alarm to the Call Center for a response, as more fully described in the Documentation.\nThe Monitoring Services are deemed to be a Product under the Agreement.</p>2.&nbsp;<u>Monitoring Services</u>.<p>\n<b>a.</b>&nbsp;In order to use the Monitoring Services, Customer must: (i) purchase a License for each location at which Monitoring Services will be provided (a \u201c&nbsp;<b>Monitoring License</b>\u201d).\nand (ii) enable the \u201cEmergency Dispatch\u201d toggle within the Hosted Software, as more fully described in the Documentation.</p>\n<p>\n<b>b.</b>&nbsp;For each Alarm transmitted through the Hosted Software, the Call Center will respond in accordance with its internal operating procedures, and only if warranted in the sole discretion of the Call Center.\nNot all Alarms require notification to First Responders.\nIf the video verification settings are set to \u2018Normal Mode\u2019 (as described in the Documentation), the Call Center may not notify the individuals on the Call List if it is unable to determine a threat to person or property, including because Call Center cannot discern a threat from the video provided or it is unable to access video of the trigger event.\nOnce dispatched, the Call Center may be unable to recall First Responders.</p>\n<p>\n<b>c.</b>&nbsp;In the event of notification to Customer, the Call Center will call the person(s) named in the Call List, in the order set by Customer.\nReceipt by Customer of any form of notification provided by the Call Center pursuant to the Call List, is deemed compliance with the notification obligation hereunder, which notice may include SMS or voice mail message.</p>\n<p>\n<b>d.</b>&nbsp;If video or audio Alarms are received at the Call Center, the Call Center will monitor such video or sound in accordance with its internal operating procedures, and for so long as the Call Center, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.</p>3.&nbsp;<u>Customer\u2019s Obligations</u>.<p>\n<b>a.</b>&nbsp;Customer (or a properly licensed installer selected by Customer) is responsible for installation (including the design of such installation), maintenance, service, repair, inspection and testing of the Products.\nOnce installed, it is Customer\u2019s responsibility (or a properly licensed installer selected by Customer) to configure its Products in order to enable the Monitoring Services, including by creating and maintaining appropriate Trigger and Response Actions via the Hosted Software (i.e., by creating an \u201cAlarm Address\u201d within Customer\u2019s account in the Hosted Software and configuring it in Customer\u2019s discretion).\nMonitoring Services will be provided only if the Hardware Products have been configured to transmit Alarms to the Call Center by means of the foregoing.</p>\n<p>\n<b>b.</b>&nbsp;Customer is responsible, at Customer\u2019s sole expense, for supplying all systems, and incidental functionality (e.g., high-speed Internet access, IP Address and or wireless services, all 110 Volt AC power), necessary to operate the Products at Customer\u2019s premises.</p>\n<p>\n<b>c.</b>&nbsp;Once delivered, the Hardware Products are in the possession and control of Customer, and it is Customer\u2019s sole responsibility to regularly test the operation of its Products.\nVerkada does not design installations, install, inspect, maintain, service, repair, or test Products for Customers.</p>\n<p>\n<b>d.</b>&nbsp;Customer is responsible for obtaining and maintaining all licenses, registration and permits for the Products and Monitoring Services, including those required by the Customer\u2019s local government, necessary to use the Products as contemplated under this Alarms Addendum in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>4.&nbsp;<u>Monitoring Services Exclusions</u>.<p>\n<b>a.</b>&nbsp;Except for the systems under its control that Verkada uses to make the Hosted Software available, Alarms are transmitted over third party communication networks beyond the control of Verkada and are not maintained by Verkada.\nVerkada will not be responsible for any failure by such third-party networks which prevents transmission of Alarms from reaching the Call Center or any damages arising therefrom.</p>\n<p>\n<b>b.</b>&nbsp;Verkada will have no liability for permit fees, false alarms, false alarm fines, the manner in which First Responders respond, any response delays caused by the First Responders, the failure of First Responders to respond, or the manner in which Alarms are handled by the Call Centers or First Responders.</p>\n<p>\n<b>c.</b>&nbsp;Verkada makes no representation that any aspect of the Products meets code requirements or constitute an alarm system, burglar alarm system, fire alarm system, CCTV system, access control system or other electronic security system, as those terms are defined under the applicable laws of the jurisdictions in which Customer uses the Products.</p>\n<p>\n<b>d.</b>&nbsp;Verkada is not a Call Center and does not provide the services of a Call Center.\nVerkada does not respond to an Alarm, notify, or attempt to notify the persons named in the Call List, request dispatch of First Responders, or other agents to Customer\u2019s premises to investigate or verify an Alarm.\nThe portion of the Monitoring Services performed by Verkada is strictly limited to Verkada\u2019s automated signal and data retransmission software, receivers, and related components, routing Alarms generated from the Products at Customer\u2019s premise via a third-party network to a Call Center for response.\nThe Customer is not contracting with Verkada to provide the services of the Call Center.\nVerkada and the Call Center are independent and unrelated entities, and there is no subcontractor, employer or employee, master or servant, joint venture, partnership, or contractual relationship between them.</p>5.&nbsp;<u>Suspension &amp.\nTermination.</u>\n<p>Verkada may, without prior notice, suspend or terminate the Monitoring Services, in Verkada\u2019s sole discretion, in the event of: (a) a Force Majeure Event which renders any aspect of the Monitoring Services inoperable or impractical.\n(b) Customer defaults in its performance obligations under the Agreement or use of the Products in a manner that violates any applicable law or any third party right of privacy.\n(c) Call Center\u2019s facilities or communication networks are nonoperational.\n(d) Customer causes the Products to transmit excessive false alarms, runaway signals, or otherwise unreasonably overburdens either Verkada\u2019s systems or the Call Center\u2019s systems.\nor (e) Customer fails to provide accurate information within the Call List or fails to properly update the Call List.</p>6.&nbsp;<u>No Representations or Warranties</u>.<p>Verkada makes no representation or warranty, whether express or implied, that the Products including the Monitoring Services will prevent any loss, damage or injury to any person or property, whether by reason of burglary, theft, hold-up, fire or any other cause, or that the Products will in all cases provide the protection for which they are installed or intended.\nMonitoring Services are not error-free.\nVerkada is not an insurer, and Customer assumes all risk for loss or damage to Customer\u2019s premises, contents, business interruption, or persons on or around the premises.\nCustomer\u2019s sole remedy for Verkada\u2019s breach of this Exhibit B is to require Verkada to replace the non-operational Products as set forth in Section 3.2 of the Agreement.</p>\n<p>THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS WILL NOT APPLY, IF THE GOVERNING LAW WHERE THE CUSTOMER\u2019S PREMISE IS LOCATED PROHIBITS THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES.</p>7.&nbsp;<u>Indemnity</u>.<p>In addition to Section 10.2 of the Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by governing law, Customer will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Verkada Indemnitees from and against any Claim (including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, court costs, fees associated with investigations, or fees or fines relating to permits or false alarms) arising from Customer\u2019s use of the Monitoring Services or its performance, or failure to perform, its obligations under this Exhibit B.</p>8.&nbsp;<u>Exculpatory Clause</u>.<p>\n<b>a.</b>&nbsp;To the fullest extent permitted by governing law, Verkada will not be liable for any loss or damage sustained by Customer caused or contributed by the performance, or failure of performance, of the Monitoring Services under this Exhibit B, even if caused or contributed by any negligence of any kind or degree of the Call Center, Verkada, or any other third-party, except for Verkada\u2019s gross negligence in states that do not permit the exculpation of liability for gross negligence, recklessness and willful misconduct.</p>\n<p>\n<b>b.</b>&nbsp;IN THE EVENT THAT THE EXCULPATORY CLAUSE IS NOT ENFORCEABLE UNDER THE GOVERNING LAW WHERE THE CUSTOMER\u2019S PREMISES IS LOCATED, THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN SECTION 11 OF THE AGREEMENT SHALL GOVERN AND CONTROL.</p>9.&nbsp;<u>Insurance</u>.<p>Customer must maintain a policy of General Liability and Property Insurance for liability, casualty, fire, theft, and property damage and, upon request, will ensure that Verkada is named as additional insured, and which shall on a primary and non-contributing basis cover any loss or damage related to Customer\u2019s use of the Products.\nCustomer assumes all potential risk and damage that may arise by reason of failure of the Products, and Customer will look to its own insurance carrier for any loss or assume the risk of loss.\nVerkada will not be responsible for any portion of any loss or damage which is recovered or recoverable by Customer from insurance covering such loss or damage or for such loss or damage against which Customer is indemnified or insured.\nCustomer and all those claiming rights under Customer policies waive all rights against Verkada and its subcontractors for loss or damages caused by perils intended to be detected by the Products or covered by insurance to be obtained by Customer, except such rights as Customer or others may have to the proceeds of insurance.</p>10.&nbsp;<u>Conflict Resolution</u>.<p>In the event of any conflict, discrepancy, or inconsistency between the terms of the Agreement and this Exhibit B, the terms of this Exhibit B will govern and control.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Company<ul>\n<li>About</li>\n<li>Careers</li>\n<li>Trust</li>\n<li>Platform SLA</li>\n<li>Global Operations</li>\n<li>Verkada
