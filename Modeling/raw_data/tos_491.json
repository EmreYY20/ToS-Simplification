Authorities <p>The following information is provided for law enforcement authorities seeking information about users of the ProtonMail Service.</p> About ProtonMail <p>The ProtonMail Service provides secure e-mail service messaging to users around the world.\nYou can learn about ProtonMail by visiting our website.\nThe ProtonMail Service is offered by Swiss-based Proton Technologies AG.\nAll user information is processed and stored by Proton Technologies AG in Switzerland.</p>\n<p>Using ProtonMail for activities that break Swiss law is against ProtonMail\u2019s Terms and Conditions.\nUnder Swiss law, we are required to cooperate with law enforcement agencies on criminal investigations, within the framework of Swiss laws and privacy regulations.</p> Information Available from ProtonMail <p>ProtonMail collects user information in accordance with our Terms and Conditions, Privacy Policy and any applicable separate agreement such as a GDPR Data Processing Agreement or a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement.\nE-mails are stored on ProtonMail servers in encrypted format.\nThey are also transmitted in encrypted format between our servers and user devices.\nE-mails between ProtonMail users are also transmitted with end-to-end encryption.\nBecause data is encrypted at all steps, Proton Technologies AG cannot decrypt user messages.</p> ProtonMail User Notification Policy <p>Swiss law requires a user to be notified if a third party makes a request for their private data and such data is to be used in a criminal proceeding.\nHowever, in certain situations, notification can be delayed.\nThis includes the following cases</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where providing notice is temporarily prohibited by the Swiss legal process itself, by Swiss court order, or applicable Swiss law;</li>\n<li>Where, based on information supplied by law enforcement, we, in our absolute discretion, believe that providing notice could create a risk of injury, death, or irreparable damage to an identifiable individual or group of individuals</li>\n<li>As a general rule though, targeted users will eventually be informed and afforded the opportunity to object to the data request, either by ProtonMail or by Swiss authorities.</li>\n</ul> Requesting Assistance <p>Whether you are a Swiss or a foreign law enforcement agency, please make your request for assistance directly to legal@protonmail.com.\nWe will generally respond to you within 1 business day, although our response time is usually much shorter than this during Swiss business hours.\nMore critical cases will automatically be given higher priority by our team.</p>\n<p>We recommend law enforcement agencies contact us directly because it allows for faster responses and reaction times compared to official Swiss government channels which can take weeks or months to process requests.\nOur legal team will be able to advise you on whether or not we will be able to assist you with your particular case, and assist with the preservation of data if we believe that your request will be validated by Swiss authorities.\nFor example, in ransomware cases, we can preserve information on which victims contacted the suspect, so that victims can be notified.</p>\n<p>Depending on the nature of your case and which country the request is originating from, Proton Technologies AG may redirect you to competent Swiss authorities in order to respect the relevant Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) or for a Swiss case to be opened.\nIf you are requesting that an email address being used for phishing, spamming, or abuse be disabled, we can generally assist without requiring a Swiss court order.\nPlease address any request for suspension with relevant evidence to abuse@protonmail.com.</p> Required Information <p>We will be unable to process overly broad or vague requests.\nAll requests must identify requested data with particularity and include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The name of the issuing authority, name and badge or ID number of responsible agent, email address from a law enforcement domain and direct contact phone number</li>\n<li>The specific ProtonMail account suspected of illegal activities</li>\n<li>A copy of the police report or court order (either foreign or domestic)</li>\n<li>A copy of the MLAT or international assistance request (if available)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any requests must be submitted by emailing legal@protonmail.com.</p> Guidelines may change <p>Proton Technologies AG reserves the right to update this information periodically.\nPlease consult it before making any future requests.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> ", "created_at": "2019-09-23 18:45:52.120034", "updated_at": "2020-12-14 19:53:35.536057"}, {"id": 365, "name": "Terms of Service", "url":

Company will credit the user\u2019s Account.\nService credits are applied at the user\u2019s request and will apply toward the balance due at the end of the next billing cycle (either monthly or yearly).</p>\n<p> The Company calculates service credits in the following way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> If the monthly uptime is less than 99.95% but equal to or greater than 99.0%, the service credit is equal to 10% of the Service\u2019s monthly cost;</li>\n<li>If the monthly uptime is less than 99.0%, the service credit is equal to 30% of the Service\u2019s cost.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some performance issues

Team <p>\n<em>Updated on March 17, 2020</em>\n</p>\n<p>From time to time, ProtonMail may receive requests for assistance from law enforcement authorities.\nAs a strict general rule, ProtonMail only complies with legally binding orders that have been approved by Swiss authorities.\nMoreover, under article 271 of the Swiss Criminal Code, it is an offence to comply with foreign requests that have not been approved by the Swiss authorities.\nTherefore, ProtonMail only complies to two types of orders: (1) orders from the Swiss authorities and (2) foreign requests that have been duly instructed and validated by Swiss authorities through an international legal assistance procedure and determined to be in compliance with Swiss law.</p>\n<p>ProtonMail is not required to store communications metadata or IP information, as we are exempted under the Swiss Federal Act on the Surveillance of Post and Telecommunications (B\u00dcPF) and its accompanying ordinance.\nTherefore, ProtonMail can apply a policy of collecting as little user information as possible to protect user privacy.\nTo know exactly what kind of metadata your use of ProtonMail creates, please refer to our <u>Privacy Policy</u>.\nUpon receiving a judicial order, ProtonMail is obliged to provide any user information readily available that would help identify a user that is subject to a criminal investigation that has been validated by Swiss authorities.\nIn addition to the items listed in our privacy policy, in extreme criminal cases, ProtonMail may also be obligated to monitor the IP addresses which are being used to access the ProtonMail accounts which are engaged in criminal activities.\nUnder no circumstances will ProtonMail be able to provide the contents of end-to-end encrypted messages sent on ProtonMail.</p>\n<p>All data orders are also checked by our internal abuse and legal team.\nIn the event that we have questions about the legality of an order under Swiss law, ProtonMail will always request further clarification from Swiss authorities.\nIf doubts persist and the order appears not to be compliant with legal requirements, ProtonMail will contest it to the extent permitted by law.</p>\n<p>ProtonMail may also sometimes act upon other types of requests.\nIf presented with overwhelming evidence that the account in question is being used for illegal purposes against our Terms and Conditions, the offending account will be suspended immediately.\nLegality is assessed on Swiss law, and illegal purposes include activities such as phishing, ransomware, or identity theft.\nNo data is handed to third parties during this process unless a qualifying data order is also received.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Edit August 28th, 2019: Due to some confusion from the information previously provided below, we are editing to clarify that we only provide information when ordered to do so by Swiss authorities.\nPreviously, there was confusion arising from the fact that we sometimes comply with orders before we have been officially served with the order via registered post, in cases where we are informed in advance that the order has already been approved.</em>\n</p>\nWarrant Canary:\n<ul>\n<li>In the 4th quarter of 2015, we received an order from the Swiss Federal Police to retain data for an account that was the subject of a criminal investigation.\nThe data preservation order was made by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation via MLAT agreement.\nAfter consultation with counsel, Proton Technologies AG decided to comply with the order and preserve the relevant account data.\nNo data was handed over as we have yet to receive a binding court order for this data.</li>\n<li>In the 1st quarter of 2016, we received an order for user data from the Minist\u00e8re public of the Republique et Canton de Gen\u00e8ve, originating from the United Kingdom, which was legally valid under la Convention europ\u00e9ene d\u2019entraide judiciaire en mati\u00e8re p\u00e9nale (CEEJ Strasbourg 1959, RS 0.351.1) and the Deuxi\u00e8me Protocole additionnel (Strasbourg 2001, RS 0.351.12).\nThe full facts of the criminal incident was provided to us.\nGiven that criminal action was clearly involved and in breach of our terms and conditions, we declined to mount a court challenge against the order.\nProton Technologies AG decided to comply with the data order, to the extent that it is possible, given our cryptography.</li>\n<li>In the second quarter of 2016, we received a request for user data as part of an ongoing investigation into a bomb threat in the United States.\nWe agreed to retain (but not to hand over) data on this case, pending the issuance of a Swiss court order for this data.</li>\n<li>In the second quarter of 2016, we received an order from Swiss authorities on behalf of German authorities requesting information in a case where a minor was at risk.\nWe complied with the order which was subsequently delivered to our office by registered post.\nIt is ProtonMail\u2019s policy to always assist authorities in cases involving pedophilia or terrorism.</li>\n<li>In the second quarter of 2016, we received an order from Swiss authorities on behalf of French authorities requesting information on a case involving extortion.\nUpon our request, Swiss authorities provided to us a copy of the International Letters Rogatory and court order approved by a Paris judge.\nUpon our request, a Swiss court order was also provided for this data request.\nSince clear evidence of a crime was provided and the requested paperwork was in order, Proton Technologies AG decided to comply with the data order, to the extent that it is possible, given our cryptography.</li>\n<li>In the fourth quarter of 2016, we received an order from Swiss authorities from the Canton de Vaud, seeking information in a fraud case.\nAfter reviewing the relevant court order, Proton Technologies AG decided to comply with the data order, to the extent that it is possible, given our cryptography.</li>\n<li>In the first quarter of 2017, we received an order from the Swiss Federal Police regarding a cause of fraud which occurred in the Czech Republic.\nCzech authorities had secured the appropriate Swiss court approvals via an International Letters Rogatory and provided evidence documenting the fraud which had occurred.\nAfter reviewing the relevant court order, Proton Technologies AG decided to comply, to the extent that it is possible, given our cryptography.</li>\n<li>In the first quarter of 2017, we received an order from the Swiss Federal Police that originated from the law enforcement authorities of the Republic of Georgia concerning an alleged cybercrime.\nAfter reviewing the relevant court order, our legal team determined it was excessively broad and we challenged the order.</li>\n<li>In February 2017, we received notification from the Geneva prosecutor\u2019s office regarding an impending data request from overseas that will come with a valid International Letters Rogatory.\nThe most probable data requester is US law enforcement.\n<em>Update: The request is from the US Department of Justice in a case of extortion against a prominent advisory firm.\nAfter reviewing the relevant evidence forwarded by US authorities, criminal intent was apparent, so Proton Technologies AG decided to comply with the data request, to the extent that it is possible, given our cryptography.</em>\n</li>\n<li>In March 2017, we received an order from the Geneva prosecutor\u2019s office regarding a data request from overseas that came with a valid International Letters Rogatory.\nThe request came from German law enforcement, investigating an account with links to ISIS.\nHowever, we were unable to provide the data requested by German law enforcement as we did not have access to the data requested.</li>\n<li>In April 2017, we received a request from the Swiss Federal Police about an information request coming from a former Soviet republic (not Russia) regarding a case with an immediate threat of bodily harm to innocent civilians.\nProton Technologies AG decided to comply immediately with the data order, to the extent that it is possible, given our cryptography, with the understanding that the Swiss court order will be immediately delivered to our office by registered post.</li>\n<li>In May 2017, we received a request from US authorities in a US tax and money laundering case.\nWe have informed US authorities that the request must pass through the Swiss Federal Police and be approved by a Swiss court before we will respond.\n<em>Update: After contesting the validity of the warrant with assistance from lawyers from the EFF, the US authorities have decided not to pursue the search and seizure warrant.\n</em>\n</li>\n<li>In July 2017, we received a request for assistance from British police in the case of the kidnapping of Chloe Ayling.\nIn light of the fact that we were able to verify that the kidnappers were, in fact, using a ProtonMail account, and the fact that the first 48 hours are the most critical in kidnapping cases, we rendered assistance to law enforcement before the signed order was delivered to us, but with the understanding that the court order was in the process of being sent.\nWe delayed disclosure on our transparency report at the request of police until the victim was successfully rescued.\n<em>Update: The court order was indeed received soon after we rendered assistance.</em>\n</li>\n<li>In August 2017, we received a request for assistance from Turkish law enforcement authorities that was passed to us through the Swiss Federal Police.\nWe rejected the request on account of the Turkish government\u2019s human rights record and will take the case to Swiss courts if the Turkish government files for an international proceeding.</li>\n<li>In January 2018, we received two requests for assistance from US law enforcement, regarding bomb threats made with ProtonMail.\nWe rendered assistance to Swiss law enforcement working on this case without having yet received the court order, but with the understanding that the approved court was on its way to us.\n<em>Update: The court order was indeed received soon after we rendered assistance.</em>\n</li>\n<li>In March 2018, we received a police request from Austria involving a politician who was accused of sexual harassment.\nThe authorities are trying to identify the person who reported the accusation.\nSince the person who made the report is likely entitled to certain privacy protections, we have rejected the order even though it was approved by a Swiss court, and have requested that the Geneva prosecutor\u2019s office review the facts of the case again and provide Proton legal with additional information.</li>\n<li>In May 2018, upon the request from the top law enforcement officer from an EU country in a case involving terrorism with an imminent threat, we disabled an account and rendered assistance, with the assurance from Swiss authorities that a court order was on its way to us.\nWe did indeed receive the court order.\nPer our standard procedure for cases like this, we will attend the court hearing to learn details from the relevant authorities about this case and to ensure that all applicable due process was followed.</li>\n<li>In January 2019, we discovered evidence that a data request from an EU country in Eastern Europe may be improperly targeting a whistleblower that exposed corruption involving a high ranking politician.\nAs a result, we are opposing the assistance order from the Swiss prosecutor\u2019s office.</li>\n<li>In April 2019, upon the order of the Swiss judiciary in a case of clear criminal conduct, we enabled IP logging against a specific user account which is engaged in illegal activities which contravene Swiss law.\nPursuant to Swiss law, the user in question will also be notified and afforded the opportunity to defend against this in court before the data can be used in criminal proceedings.</li>\n<li>In July 2019, we received a request for information that was approved by the Swiss judiciary involving a case in another EU country, which upon further assessment, we suspect could be targeting a whistleblower.\nWe have refused to hand over data while seeking further clarification from the authorities as to why this request for information was approved in the first place, and asking for Swiss authorities to re-check the facts of the case.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Request Statistics</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Aggregated statistics

for a long time.\nWhile it would have also been possible to open source ProtonMail 1.x, we felt that such a move was not appropriate given that the code was intended to be deprecated.\nBy open

\u201cAccount\u201d) and all its related features, including Proton Mail, Proton Contacts, Proton Calendar, and Proton Drive (the \u201cServices\u201d), you understand that your data in relation with your use of our Services is processed according to the following privacy policy.\nThis policy states (i) what data we collect through your access and uses of the Services.\n(ii) the use we make of such data.\nand (iii) the safeguards put in place to protect your data.\nThis privacy policy is to be read and understood as being a complement to our terms of service.</p>\n<p>Please note, Proton VPN is subject to a different policy, please visit protonvpn.com/privacy-policy for additional details.</p>1.\nLegal framework <p>The Services are operated by Proton AG (the \u201cCompany\u201d, \u201cWe\u201d), domiciled at Route de la Galaise 32, 1228 Plan-les-Ouates, Geneva, Switzerland.\nIt is therefore governed by the laws and regulations of Switzerland.\nAdditional information about the legal framework can be found in our transparency report and on our law enforcement help page.\n</p>\n<p>We are also GDPR compliant.\nThe designated representative of the Company in the European Union (notably for the purpose of art.\n27 GDPR) is Proton Europe s\u00e0rl, rue de Gr\u00fcnewald 94, L-1912 Luxembourg.</p>2.\nData collection and usage<strong>\n</strong>\n<p>Our overriding policy is to collect as little user information (personal data included) as possible to ensure a completely private user experience when using the Services.\nWe do not have the technical means to access the content of your encrypted emails, files, and calendar events.</p>\n<p>Data collection is limited to the following:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.1 Visiting our website</strong>: We employ a local installation of self-developed analytics tools.\nAnalytics are anonymized whenever possible and stored locally (and not on the cloud).\nIP addresses are not retained and stored for such analytics.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.2 Account creation</strong>: It is not necessary to provide personal information in order to create an Account, but you may provide an external email address for notification or password recovery purposes.\nShould you choose to provide it, we do associate this email address with your Account (for password recovery or notification purposes).\nSuch data will only be used to contact you with important notifications about the Services, to send you information related to security, to verify your account or to send you password recovery links if you enable the option.\nWe may also inform you about new Proton products in which you might have an interest.\nThe legal basis for processing is consent and you are free to remove that data in your Account settings panel at any time.</p>\n<p>In order to maintain the integrity of the Services, we must take measures to avoid creation of accounts by spammers.\nThis is because if spammers use Proton Mail to send messages, Proton Mail\u2019s IP addresses can become blocked by major mail providers such as Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, etc.\nIn order to pursue our legitimate interest of preventing the creation of accounts by spam bots or human spammers, we use a variety of human verification methods.\nVerification may also be requested for some sensitive operations besides account creation in order to protect against brute-force attacks.\nYou may be asked to verify using either hCaptcha (or reCAPTCHA in the event that hCaptcha is unavailable), email, or SMS.\nIP addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers provided are saved temporarily in order to send you a verification code and for anti-spam purposes.\nThe period of temporary data retention is determined by our legitimate interests of protecting the service from spam, and also by any applicable Swiss legal requirements we must comply with.\nIf this data is saved permanently, it is always saved as a cryptographic hash, which ensures that the raw values cannot be deciphered by us.\nLearn more</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.3 Proton Mail Account activity</strong>: Due to limitations of the SMTP protocol, we have access to the following email metadata: sender and recipient email addresses, the IP address incoming messages originated from, message subject, and message sent and received times.\nWe do NOT have access to encrypted message content, but unencrypted messages sent from external providers to your Account, or from Proton Mail to external unencrypted email services, are scanned for spam and viruses to pursue the legitimate interest of protecting the integrity of our Services and users.\nSuch inbound messages are scanned for spam in memory, and then encrypted and written to disk.\nWe do not possess the technical ability to scan the content of the messages after they have been encrypted.\nWe also have access to the following records of Account activity: number of messages sent, amount of storage space used, total number of messages, last login time.\nUser data is never used for advertising purposes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.4 Proton Calendar Account activity</strong>: The Service needs to be able to access some properties of events in order to retrieve and index them efficiently as well as send required notifications and alarms.\nIn order to do so, we have access to the following metadata: calendar name and description, event unique identifier (UID), start and end date (including time zone), repetition rule (including exclusion dates or times), attendees\u2019 participation status, organizer information (only when an invite is issued or received), alarms and notifications, event creation and update times and event status (confirmed or cancelled).\nWe do NOT have access to the description of the events, their summary or title, locations, and the attendees\u2019 email addresses.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.5 Proton Drive Account activity</strong>: For operational purposes, the Service must have access to the following metadata unencrypted: file/folder creation and modification timestamps, file/folder permissions, file type, file/folder creator.\nWhen sharing a file or folder, we need to record which users own or can access said shared file or folder.\nWhen sharing URLs, we have access to the creation and last access time, the number of times the URL was accessed to and its creator.\nHowever, we do NOT have access to file contents, file and folder names, and thumbnail previews.\nSuch data is end-to-end encrypted.\nWe only store the size of the encrypted files, not the size of the original unencrypted file.\nIn the case of a report for abuse of a shared URL by a third party, the latter has access to the password used to decrypt the file(s) and transmits it to us.\nWe only can access the content of the file(s) in such cases.\n</p>\n<p>In addition to end-to-end encryption, all content is also cryptographically signed by the user, before sending it to us.\nThis means that you can always check the signature of any content you get back from our servers, which protects you from forgery (e.g.\nby a malicious actor).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.6 Communicating with Proton</strong>: Your communications with us, such as support requests, bug reports, or feature requests may be saved by our staff.\nThe legal basis for processing is our legitimate interest to troubleshoot more efficiently and improve the quality of our Services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.7 IP logging</strong>: By default, we do not keep permanent IP logs in relation with your Account.\nHowever, IP logs may be kept temporarily to combat abuse and fraud, and your IP address may be retained permanently if you are engaged in activities that breach our terms and conditions (e.g.\nspamming, DDoS attacks against our infrastructure, brute force attacks).\nThe legal basis of this processing is our legitimate interest to protect our service against nefarious activities.</p>\n<p>If you enable authentication logging for your Account, the record of your login IP addresses is kept for as long as the feature is enabled.\nThis feature is off by default, and all the records are deleted upon deactivation of the feature.\nThe legal basis of this processing is consent, and you are free to opt in or opt out of that processing at any time in the security panel of your Account.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.8 Payment information</strong>: We rely on third parties to process credit card, PayPal, and Bitcoin transactions and must therefore share payment information with them.\nAnonymous cash or Bitcoin payments and donations are accepted.\nThe legal basis of this processing is the necessity to the execution of the contract to provide the Services.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.9 Native applications</strong>: When you use our native applications, we (or the mobile app platform providers) may collect certain information.\nWe may use mobile analytics software (e.g.\nfabric.io app statistics and crash reporting, Play Store app statistics, App Store app statistics, or self-hosted Sentry crash reporting) to send crash information to our developers in order to rapidly fix bugs.\nSome platforms, such as Google\u2019s Play Store or Apple\u2019s App Store may also collect aggregate, anonymous statistics, which may be governed by their respective privacy policies and terms and conditions.\nSuch statistics can include most commonly used devices and operating systems (e.g.\npercentage of Android 6.x v.\nAndroid 7.x), total number of installs and uninstalls, and the total number of active users.\n</p>\n<p>Our applications do not access or track any location-based information from your device.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.10 Import Assistant with \u201cSign in with Google\u201d</strong>: When you use our Import Assistant tool to import your data from Google and authenticate using the \u201cSign in with Google\u201d option, our Import Assistant\u2019s processing of information received from Google APIs will be performed in accordance with Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.11 Import Assistant with a username and password combination</strong>: When you use our Import Assistant tool to import your emails from another service provider, the credentials of the email account from which the importation is performed are stored by us for the limited duration of the importation.\nOnce the importation is performed, those credentials are entirely deleted from our systems.</p>\n<p>Please note, Proton VPN is subject to a different policy, please visit protonvpn.com/privacy-policy for additional details.</p>3.\nData storage<p>All servers used in connection with the provision of the Services are wholly owned and operated by the Company or its subsidiaries.\nOnly employees of the Company have physical or other access to the servers.\nData is always stored in encrypted format on our servers.\nOffline backups, which may be stored periodically, are also encrypted.\nWe cannot decrypt any user encrypted content on either the production servers or in the backups.\nBackups are kept for up to 30 days.</p>4.\nThird-party networks <p>Proton's alternative routing technology allows Proton Services to bypass many censorship blocks, but in doing so your network traffic may go through third-party networks, which we do not control.\nThis could enable a third party to record your IP address or see that you are using Proton apps (the same information that your Internet Service Provider is able to see).\nThese third parties cannot see your actual data, which remains encrypted.\nBy default, alternative routing is not used for Proton apps unless they detect that censorship measures are active on your network.\nAlternative routing can also be disabled in the Settings panel of our mobile and desktop applications.\nHowever, doing so may cause you to be unable to access your Account from a network that is censoring Proton.\nLearn more</p>5.\nData subprocessors <p>To provide the Services, we rely on different data subprocessors, which process different categories of data.\nProcessors never store data outside of the scope of their specific purpose.\n<strong>Notably, they do not store data in relation with the general day-to-day use of your Account and Services</strong>, which is exclusively processed by the Company.\nSubprocessors are as follow:</p>5.1 Proton Group subprocessors <p>\n<strong>ProtonLabs DOOEL Skopje</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Purpose: Process data in relation with customer support requests, or other direct communications with the company (section 2.4)</li>\n<li>Data processing location: Macedonia</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>ProtonLabs Taiwan Co., Ltd</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Purpose: Process data in relation with customer support requests, or

location: United States, Singapore</li>\n</ul>6.\nData disclosure<p>We will only disclose the limited user data we possess if we are legally obligated to do so by a binding request coming from the competent Swiss authorities.\nWe may comply with electronically delivered notices only when they are delivered in full compliance with the requirements of Swiss law.\nProton\u2019s general policy is to challenge requests whenever possible and where there are doubts as to the validity of the request or if there is a public interest in doing so.\nIn such situations, we will not comply with the request until all legal or other remedies have been exhausted.\nUnder Swiss law, subjects of judicial procedures have to be notified of such procedures, although such notification has to come from the authorities and not from the Company.\nUnder no circumstances can Proton decrypt encrypted message content and disclose decrypted copies.\nAggregate statistics about data requests from the competent Swiss authorities can be found in our transparency report.\n</p>7.\nRight to access, rectification, erasure, portability, and right to lodge a complaint <p>Through your Account interface, you can directly access, edit, delete, or export personal data processed by the Company in your use of the Services.</p>\n<p>If your Account has been suspended for a breach of our terms and conditions, and you would like to exercise the rights related to your personal data, you can make a request to our support team.</p>\n<p>In case of violation of your rights, you have the right to lodge a complaint to the competent supervisory authority.</p>8.\nModifications to privacy policy <p>We reserve the right to periodically review and change this policy from time to time and will notify users who have enabled the notification preference about changes to our privacy policy.\nContinued use of the Services will be deemed acceptance of such changes.</p>", "created_at": "2018-08-24 12:24:50.652413",
