court.<br>\n<strong>Restrictions</strong>\n<br>\nThe Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually.\nTo the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding.\n(b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures.\nand (c)
