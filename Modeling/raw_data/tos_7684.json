it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity and therefore confirm the personal information in our possession actually relates to you.</p>\n<p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.\nWe will use any personal information collected from you in connection with the verification of your request solely for the purposes of verification and shall not further disclose the personal information, retain it longer than necessary for purposes of verification, or use it for unrelated purposes.</p>\n<p>If you

will explain you the reasons behind our denial.</p>\n<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.\nIn such
