initiating arbitration.\nSuch informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>Binding Arbitration</strong>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nIf the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally

fails to do so.\nExcept where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in United States, California.\nExcept as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nIf for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in United States, California, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.\nApplication of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) is excluded from these Terms of Use.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nIn no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be commenced more than one (1) years after the cause of action arose.\nIf this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable, and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>Restrictions</strong>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nThe Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually.\nTo the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding.\n(b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures.\nand (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other
