is aware that unauthorised third parties may send emails under the name of Bytro Labs, without Bytro Lab\u2019s knowledge or consent, and such emails may contain viruses, so-called spyware or links to websites which, in turn, contain viruses or spyware.\nBytro Lab cannot prevent such behaviour.\nThe Participant will, therefore, check all incoming mail sent by or under the name of Bytro Labs, for viruses before opening them.\nThis also applies to emails sent by other Participants.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>13.7&nbsp;Bytro Labs will usually, unless otherwise provided in these ToS or other

future, if this should prove necessary and if the Participant is not disadvantaged contrary to good faith.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>14.2&nbsp;The Participant will be notified of the changes to the ToS at least two weeks before the changes become effective, in appropriate written form.\nNotification will usually take place upon the next log-in of the Participant.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>14.3&nbsp;The Participant can object to a change or amendment of the ToS within one month of being notified thereof.\nIf the Participant objects in time,

website, you merely need to provide an email address and/or user name and/or password.The password is encrypted and does not allow any conclusion to be made on the actual password at any time.\nWithin the scope of carrying out the user contract concluded, in particular your chosen fee-based services, additional data, such as complete name, address, banking details, credit card numbers, etc.\nmay be required.\nAdditionally, when processing your requests or to provide you with support, it is sometimes required to ask you for personal data such as name, address, email address, and telephone number.\nWe also collect data as part of voluntary participation in inquiries and surveys.\nWe submit personal data only to cooperating companies or external service providers, provided this is legally required or permitted, in particular in performance of a contract, to process payments, as well as to protect other users or defend against dangers for national or public security, or to prosecute criminal offenses.\nYour interests worthy of protection are considered in pursuance with statutory data protection regulations.\nIn the event of a default in payment, we hereby reserve the right to commission a collection agency or an attorney to collect the payment due, as needed, and to provide the necessary data within this context.\nWe treat all of this data in a confidential manner and in consideration of statutory data protection regulations.\nAs a rule, we do not provide such information to third parties without your permission, unless it is required to execute and settle the contract, to process your request, or to provide you with support, or permitted according to statutory data protection regulations.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.\nLegal basis for processing personal data</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If we receive the consent of the person concerned to process personal data, Art.\n6 Para.\n1 a of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis for processing personal data.\nWhen processing personal data that is required to perform a contract whose contractual party is the person concerned, Art.\n6 Para.\n1 b GDPR serves as the legal basis.\nThis also applies to processing processes that are required to carry out pre-contractual measures.\nIf personal data must be processed to comply with a legal requirement to which our company is subject, Art.\n6 Para.\n1 c GDPR serves as the legal basis.\nIn the event that the vital interests of the person concerned or another natural person make it necessary to process personal data, Art.\n6 Para.\n1 d GDPR serves as the legal basis.\nIf processing is required to protect a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, and if the interests, basic rights, and basic freedoms of the party concerned do not prevail over the previously stated interest, Art.\n6 Para.\n1 f GDPR serves as the legal basis.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>3.\nPurpose of processing personal

security and the stability and operational security of our system as well as accounting purposes.\nWe process data in order to provide you assistance when you submit support inquiries.\nData is also processed in order to discover and prevent the improper use of multiple accounts, e.g.\nfraudulent purposes.\nData is processed in order to acquire new customers and distribute promotional material that we believe correlates with your interests.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>4.\nData erasure and storage

also serves to optimize the services and to ensure the security of our IT systems.\nData is stored over the duration of the session for purposes of combating fraud (e.g.\npayment fraud, violation of

purposes of statistical evaluation.\nIn order to monitor compliance with the rules of use and rules of play, we reserve the right to store IP addresses and log files for a certain period of time after our services are utilized.\nIn particular, this procedure serves to avoid certain cases of misuse or to resolve them and be able to forward the data in individual cases to investigative authorities or to rectify bugs.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, any evaluation of data is carried out in an anonymous manner wherever possible.\nAfter this period ends, the IP address and log files are completely erased,
