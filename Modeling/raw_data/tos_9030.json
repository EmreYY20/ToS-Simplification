welcome any feedback about these sites.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Google</b>\n</p>\n<p>Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles.\nThey are put in place to provide a positive experience for users.\nhttps://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en</p>\n<p>We use Google AdSense Advertising on our website.</p>\n<p>Google, as a third-party vendor, uses

services to post a privacy policy.\nThe law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.\n- See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>\n<p>\n<b>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</b>\n</p>\n<p>Users can visit our site anonymously.</p>\n<p>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.</p>\n<p>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.</p>\n<p>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:</p>\n<p>\n<b>\u2022</b> On our Privacy Policy Page</p>\n<p>You can change your personal information:</p>\n<p>\n<b>\u2022</b> By emailing us</p>\n<p>\n<b>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</b>\n</p>\n<p>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</b>\n</p>\n<p>It's also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking</p>\n<p>\n<b>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</b>\n</p>\n<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.\nThe Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>\n<p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Fair Information Practices</b>\n</p>\n<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.\nUnderstanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>\n<p>\n<b>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</b>\n</p>\n<p>We will notify you via email</p>\n<p>\n<b>\u2022</b> Within 7 business days</p>\n<p>We will notify the users via in-site notification</p>\n<p>\n<b>\u2022</b> Within 7 business days</p>\n<p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.\nThis principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>\n<p>The Mackinac Center for Public Policy is a nonprofit research and educational institute that advances the principles of free markets and limited government.\nThrough our research and education programs, we challenge government overreach and advocate for a free-market approach to public policy that frees people to realize their potential and dreams.</p>\n<p>Please consider contributing to our work to advance a freer and more prosperous
