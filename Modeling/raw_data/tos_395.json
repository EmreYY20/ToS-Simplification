arbitrator.\nFor purposes of this Arbitration Provision, references to \u201cyou\u201d include your direct and indirect parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates as well as the predecessors, successors, assigns, officers, directors, agents or employees of any of them.\nreferences to \u201cCovered Parties\u201d include Wave Financial, Inc.\nand Wave Financial USA Inc., their respective direct and

theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise prior to, during, or after the termination of any service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU

Parties\u2019 right to (i) elect that an individual claim be decided in small claims court as long as it is brought and maintained as an individualized claim, or (ii) bring issues to the attention of federal, state, provincial, or local agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3.\nPRE-ARBITRATION NOTICE OF DISPUTE.\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first mail a written Notice of Dispute

Ste.\n200, Denver CO 80202.\nThe Notice must be on an individual basis and provide at least the following information: (a) the claimant\u2019s name, telephone number, and e-mail address.\n(b) the nature or basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (c) the specific relief sought.\nIf the dispute is not resolved within 60 days after the Notice is received, then you or the Covered Parties may file an arbitration.\nThe existence or substance of any settlement discussions shall not be disclosed.</p>\n<p>4.\nARBITRATION RULES.\nAny arbitration between you and the Covered Parties will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d), or if the AAA determines that you are not a consumer, the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules, as modified by this Arbitration Provision or any other instructions that the parties may agree upon at the time (collectively, the \"AAA Rules\"), and will be administered by the AAA.\nThe AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nIf AAA is unavailable or unwilling to administer the arbitration consistent with this Arbitration Provision, the parties shall agree to, or the court shall select, another arbitration provider.\nThe arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney specifically licensed to practice law in the state of your residence and selected by the parties from the arbitration provider\u2019s national roster of arbitrators.\nThe arbitrator will be selected using the following procedure: (1) the arbitrator provider will send the parties a list of five candidates meeting this criteria.\n(2) if the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator from the list, each party shall return its list to the arbitration provider within 10 days, striking up to two candidates, and ranking the remaining candidates in order of preference.\n(3) the arbitration provider shall appoint as arbitrator the candidate with the highest aggregate ranking.\nand (4) if for any reason the appointment cannot be made according to this procedure, the arbitration provider will provide the parties a new list of five candidates meeting the above criteria until an appointment can be made.</p>\n<p>5.\nARBITRATION COSTS.\nPayment of all filing, administrative, arbitrator, and hearing fees will be governed by the applicable AAA rules.&nbsp.\nIf you inform us that you cannot afford to pay your share of the fees, we will consider advancing those fees on your behalf.\nIn addition, if the AAA concludes that its Consumer Arbitration Rules apply, we will reimburse you for your share of the fees at the conclusion of the arbitration (regardless of who wins) unless (i) you failed to comply with paragraph 3 above or paragraph 7 below, or (ii) either the substance of your claim or the relief you sought was determined to be frivolous or brought for an improper purpose as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), in which case the payment of fees will be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules and you agree to reimburse the Covered Parties for all fees advanced on your behalf.</p>\n<p>6.&nbsp.\nHEARING.\nAny arbitration hearings will take place in the county of your billing address.</p>\n<p>7.&nbsp.\nNO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS.\nAll arbitrations will proceed on an individual basis and may not proceed in any manner as a class action arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstance unless all parties consent in writing.\nYOU AND THE COVERED PARTIES AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND IN DOING SO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO ASSERT OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS ACTION ARBITRATION, TO ASSERT OR PARTICIPATE IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL LAWSUIT OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ARBITRATION, AND TO ASSERT OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY JOINT OR CONSOLIDATED LAWSUIT OR JOINT OR CONSOLIDATED ARBITRATION OF ANY KIND.\nThe arbitrator is empowered to resolve the dispute with the same remedies and defenses available in court, but the arbitrator\u2019s rulings or any relief granted must be individualized to you and will not apply to or affect any other Person or company.\nIf a court decides that applicable Law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph\u2019s limitations as to a particular claim or any particular request for a remedy for a claim (such as a request for public injunctive relief), then only that particular claim or only that particular request for a remedy (and only that particular claim or particular request for a remedy) must remain in court and be severed from any arbitration.</p>\n<p>8.&nbsp.\nOTHER TERMS AND INFORMATION.\nThis Arbitration Provision will be governed by, and interpreted, construed, and enforced in accordance with, the Federal Arbitration Act and other applicable federal Law.\nExcept as set forth above in paragraph 7, if any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of the Arbitration Provision.\nThis Arbitration Provision supersedes any prior arbitration agreement between you and the Covered Parties.\nNo arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to any issues or claims in any dispute, arbitration, or court proceeding where any party was not a named party in the arbitration, unless and except as required by applicable Law.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>9.\nARBITRATION FOR CANADIAN CUSTOMERS.\nAny claim between you and the Covered Parties (defined below) must be referred to private and confidential arbitration before a single

lot of personal information involved.\nHere\u2019s a list of exactly what we collect.</p>\n<p>We also compile certain aggregate or anonymized data about our users.\nWhat is aggregate data? \u201cTim

principles on collecting, storing, and using personal information.\nBy following this list, we cover all our bases so you can rest easy knowing your personal information is safe.</p>\n<strong>1.\nAccountability and Challenging compliance</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>Wave has named a Privacy Officer who is responsible for all things privacy at Wave.\nThis includes our policies and procedures that are designed to keep your information safe.\nIf you have any questions about our privacy practices or this policy, you can contact us at:</p>\n<p>Wave Financial Inc.<br>Privacy Officer<br>235 Carlaw Ave, Suite 501 Toronto, ON M4M 2S1 Canada<br>Email: privacy@waveapps.com</p>\n<p>\n<br>If you\u2019re not satisfied with our response, you have the option of contacting the Office of Canada\u2019s Privacy Commissioner of Canada.</p>In simple Terms<p>If you have any questions or concerns about your privacy, we have someone to listen and help.\nHere\u2019s how you can get in touch with that person.</p>\n<strong>2.\nIdentifying Purposes</strong>\n<p>Wave collects, uses, discloses, and otherwise manages Personal Information in a variety of ways related to our Site and the services we provide.\nWe\u2019ve outlined these below.\nYour use of the services determines which information we collect and use.\nFor example, payroll information is optional, unless you\u2019d like to use Wave Payroll to run payrolls, at which point we will need to collect payroll information to provide you with this service.\nSimilarly, when you create an invoice, your customer\u2019s email is optional, but if you\u2019d like us to deliver the invoice by email, this information becomes necessary.</p>In simple Terms<p>Many Wave services and features simply wouldn\u2019t work without some personal information.\nHere\u2019s why and how that information is collected, stored, and used.</p>\n<p>Wave may collect, use, or store Personal Information for the purposes described below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In order to provide you with the services you request, which may include the following:</li>\n<li>We collect information directly from you when you use or interact with our Site or our services.\nThis Personal Information may relate to you, your employees, or individuals you interact with.</li>\n<li>We may also collect information from third parties when you connect your Wave account to them.\nThese integrations may pull data into or share data out of Wave.\nIn some cases, we use a service provider to connect you to a third-party service (e.g., when you connect&nbsp.\na bank account to Wave).\nWhen you connect your Wave account with a third-party service, their terms and policies apply.</li>\n<li>We may also collect your name and email address from third parties when you sign up and login to our Site using single sign-on (SSO).</li>\n</ul>In simple Terms<p>We sometimes connect with other service providers to deliver the best products and services.\nWhen this happens, your information also falls under their terms and policies.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our Site or services may offer publicly accessible blogs or community forums.\nYou should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.\nTo request removal of your Personal Information from our blog or community forum, you may contact us by emailing us at privacy@waveapps.com.\nIn some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</li>\n<li>To promote or offer you services, and to determine your eligibility for new products services we may offer from time to time.</li>\n<li>To offer you products and services from our Business Partners.</li>\n<li>To provide you with educational materials and guides relevant to the services you use.</li>\n<li>To contact you for the purposes of Service updates and system and account notifications.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>To provide you with support in connection with the services.</li>\n<li>We collect information and usage data whenever you interact with us, whether online, through a mobile application, or through an email.\nThis data may include which websites you visit, what you click on, and when you performed those actions.\nThese activities may be performed by us or a service provider acting on our behalf.</li>\n</ul>In simple Terms<p>Personal Information would only appear in our blog or community if you posted it.\nIf you\u2019ve posted on our site and want it removed, just let us know.\nWe can almost always remove it, and if not, we\u2019ll let you know why.</p>\n<strong>We do not sell your Personal Information to other companies.</strong>In simple Terms<p>We will not sell your details, ever.</p>\n<strong>How we Disclose Information.</strong>\n<br>\n<p>We may disclose your information to other Wave companies, our affiliates, or to third parties with whom we have a written contract limiting the use and disclosure of your information.\nWe may share your information to support the products and services you request or provide you information on products and services that may benefit you.</p>In simple Terms<p>There are times when personal information does need to be disclosed.\nYou have the right to know about these situations, so we\u2019ve listed them here.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Wave Companies and Our Other Affiliates, including H&amp;R Block.</strong> We may provide information to companies related by common ownership or control.\nThese companies may use this information to support the products and services you request or market additional products and services to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Business Partners.</strong> We work closely with a variety of business partners that are not Wave companies.\nWe may offer products jointly with our Business Partners.&nbsp.\nWe may share information that is related to such transactions with that Business Partners.\nWe require all Business Partners to have written agreements with us that require them to safeguard your information and prohibit them from selling, retaining, using or disclosing your personal information for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of performing the contract.</li>\n</ul>In simple Terms<p>Online products like Wave need to interact with other business partners in order to work properly.\nWhen this involves sharing personal information, we\u2019re vigilant about ensuring the information is managed securely and responsibly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Service Providers.</strong> We may transfer (or otherwise make available) your personal </li>\n<li>information to third parties who provide services on our behalf.\nWe have written agreements with our service providers that require them to utilize appropriate physical, technical, and administrative controls to protect personal information and prevent them from using personal information for any purpose other than performing the service they provide.\nFor example, we may use service providers to host our website and to process payments.\nYour Personal Information may be maintained and processed by these third parties in other jurisdictions.\nWe use service providers in Canada and the United States.\nWhen your information is in another jurisdiction, it will be subject to their laws.\nWe only share the information these service providers need to perform the service and we don\u2019t authorize them for any other use or disclosure of personal information.</li>\n</ul>In simple Terms<p>We also occasionally need to share personal information with service providers.\nThis is especially true for complicated tasks like transferring money electronically.\nWe take the same high level of caution, and ensure the information is used only for the purposes needed.<br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Persons Who Acquire Our Assets or Business.</strong> If we sell or transfer any of our business or assets (including insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings), certain information about our clients may be a part of that sale or transfer.\nIn the event such sale or transfer results in a material change to this privacy policy, we will notify you.\nThe notification procedure will be the same as the procedure we use to notify you of a change to this Privacy Notice&nbsp.\nas described below.</li>\n</ul>In simple Terms<p>If the ownership of Wave changes, customer information may be included in the transfer of ownership.\nRest assured, we\u2019ll let you know if that change causes material updates to these policies.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Responses to Legal Requests.</strong> We may disclose your information when we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is required or permitted by law pursuant to a legal request.\nThis may occur in connection with a court order, legal process, or other judicial, administrative or investigative proceeding that produces a request for information from us.\nIn certain situations, we may be required to disclose your information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</li>\n</ul>In simple Terms<p>When laws require us to share customer information with the proper authorities, we\u2019re obligated to do so.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Protection of Wave and Others.</strong> We may disclose your information when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect either your or our rights and safety.\nWe may disclose your information to federal, state, provincial, or local officials in order to, and only to the extent necessary, inform the official of activities that may constitute, or may have constituted, a violation of any criminal law or to assist the official in investigating or prosecuting a violation of criminal law.</li>\n</ul>In simple Terms<p>Like the point above, information may be shared with government authorities when legally required.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Aggregate Data.\n</strong>We may disclose aggregate information compiled using information that does not identify you individually or personally.\nThis may include, for example, the total number of visitors from a particular geographic area or the average user age.</li>\n</ul>In simple Terms<p>Some summarized, anonymous information may be shared publicly, but could never be connected to individual customers.</p>\n<strong>3.\nConsent</strong>\n<strong>Submitting the Personal Information of Others</strong>\n<p>When you submit the Personal Information of your customers or employees to us, you are responsible for informing such customers and employees about Wave, and for obtaining any necessary consent or authority from them, including informing them that Wave operates within Canada and utilizes service providers within the United States.\nIn addition, your Personal Information will be accessed by Wave employees outside of Canada and the US for business purposes.</p>\n<p>You may also choose to refer someone to our Site or through one of our referral programs.\nWe may ask for that person\u2019s name and contact information, including email address.\nWe will send them a single invitation email to the address you provide.\nPlease ensure that you only submit email addresses of individuals or businesses with whom you have a relationship and who would want to receive the message.</p>\n<strong>Closing your Wave Account</strong>\n<p>At any time and without penalty, you can close your Wave account and stop using our services.\nPlease ensure you complete the account closure process which includes a confirmation email.\nOtherwise, your account may not be closed.</p>In simple Terms<p>We\u2019d be sad to see you go, but if you do, we won\u2019t make closing your account a hassle.\nJust don\u2019t forget the confirmation email to make it official.</p>\n<strong>Email and Communications Consent</strong>\n<p>At any time, you can opt-out of commercial email communications from us by clicking on the unsubscribe link in such emails, or via the Email Preferences settings in your account.\nCertain non-commercial communications may still be sent to you that are required to provide you with our services.\nFor example, system notifications, major product changes, changes to our Terms of Use, or other news that we believe will materially affect how you interact with Wave.</p>\n<p>The only way to completely stop all emails from Wave is to close your account as outlined above.</p>In simple Terms<p>We like to keep in touch, and promise we won\u2019t overdo it.\nStill, if you\u2019d ever like to opt-out, we\u2019ve made it easy.</p>\n<p>Heads up: If you do opt out of our marketing emails, we may still send you important, non-marketing messages.</p>\n<strong>4.\nLimiting Collection</strong>\n<p>Wave only collects the Personal Information necessary to provide the services to you.\nThe services you use will determine most of the information Wave collects.\nWe\u2019ll also provide you the option of sharing additional information to enhance your Wave experience.</p>\n<p>Wave may also use third-party services to supplement or enrich our understanding of our customers.\nThis includes cross-referencing information like a name, business name, email address or IP address in third-party databases and using the information there to improve our understanding of you and your business.</p>In simple Terms<p>We only collect the personal information we need to deliver the services you want.\nWhat we collect depends on which services you use.</p>\n<p>Some of the services allow you to provide access to your Wave account to other authorized users, which we call \u201cguest collaborators\u201d.\nGuest collaborators have access to information in your Wave account, including Personal Information, and may perform various tasks on your behalf.\nYou take full responsibility for any collection, use or disclosure of your Personal Information by your guest collaborator(s).</p>\n<p>To provide access to your account to a guest collaborator, you must provide the guest collaborator\u2019s name and email address.\nWe will send them a single email inviting them to the Site.\nWave only uses this information to invite your guest collaborator.\nPlease ensure that you only submit email addresses of individuals or businesses that you have a relationship with and who would want to receive the message.\nThe guest collaborator may contact us at privacy@waveapps.com to request that we remove their name and email address from our database.\nThis will remove the guest collaborator\u2019s ability to access to or perform tasks on your behalf in your Wave account.</p>In simple Terms<p>You can allow someone else to access and use your Wave account.\nBe vigilant, as you are responsible for how that person uses the information they can access.</p>\n<strong>5.\nLimiting Use, Disclosure and Retention</strong>\n<p>We will use and disclose your Personal Information as described in this policy.\nSome Wave employees who have access to your Personal Information outside of Canada and the US.\nRegardless of where a Wave employee is physically located, your Personal Information is protected by the safeguards described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required by law.\nTo be clear, that means we\u2019ll retain your Personal Information while you have an active account, and afterward if we need to do so to meet our legal obligations.\nIf you choose to close your Wave account, we will destroy your Personal Information within 60 days unless we are otherwise legally obliged to keep it longer consistent with our retention policies or if we determine it is necessary to defend against legal claims.</p>In simple Terms<p>We take our responsibilities about using, disclosing, and storing your personal information seriously.\nWith rare legal exceptions, your information will be destroyed within 60 days of closing your account.</p>\n<strong>6.\nAccuracy</strong>\n<p>Wave relies on you to provide us with information that is accurate and complete.\nWe provide you the mechanisms and rely on you to keep your information up to date.\nYou can request updates or corrections

questions about security on our Site, you can contact us at security@waveapps.com.\nNevertheless, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.\nTherefore, we

too.</p>\n<p>You are also responsible for helping to protect the security of your Personal Information.\nFor instance, never give out your email account information or your password for the sServices to third parties.\nOur team will never request your password or PIN, and we ask that you never post account or credit card numbers to our support channels.</p>In simple Terms<p>Here are some best
