requested.\nContact our&nbsp;Privacy Officer for questions about the collection of personal information.\n&nbsp;We collect personal&nbsp;information for the following purposes:&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p> 1.\nTo provide and administer requested products and services, and to disclose the&nbsp;information for any purpose related to operation of accounts and provision of&nbsp;requested products and
