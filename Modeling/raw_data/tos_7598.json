disclose certain information to you about our collection, use, disclosure or sale of your personal information over the past 12 months.\nOnce we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see <em>Exercising Access and Deletion Rights</em>), and subject to certain limitations that we describe below, we will disclose such information.\nYou have the right to request any or all of the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The categories of sources from which the personal information is collected.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal

and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see <em>Exercising Access and Deletion Rights</em>), we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records.&nbsp.\nHowever, we may retain personal information that has been de-identified or aggregated.\nFurthermore, we may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us

activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Exercising Access and Deletion Rights&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>To exercise the access and deletion rights described above, please submit a request to us by emailing us at contact.privacyus@amnetgroup.com or via the following toll-free number: (877) 570-1441.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Only you, or a person or business entity registered with the California Secretary

to verify the identifying information we possibly maintain about you).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We will respond to consumer requests in a reasonably timely manner.\nIf we require extra time to respond, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.\nIn order to protect the security of your personal information, we will not honor a request if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.\nThe method used to verify your identity will depend on the type, sensitivity and value of the information, including the risk of harm to you posed by any authorized access or deletion.\nGenerally speaking, verification will be performed by matching the identifying information provided by you to the personal information that we already have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request (and will not be made more than twice in a 12-month period).\nIf we cannot comply with a request, or cannot fully comply with a request, the response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Non-Discrimination&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights, including, but not limited to,
