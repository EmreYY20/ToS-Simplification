confidential information about yourself or others on the Web site or elsewhere.\nMuch of the personal information we collect is used in conjunction with participation and/or member-level services such

about you, and to access that information.\nYou also have the right to request deletion of your personal information, though exceptions under the law may allow us to retain and use certain personal information notwithstanding your deletion request.&nbsp.\nFor additional information regarding such rights and laws, please review our Privacy Notice for California Residents at Appendix B hereto.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.\nData Privacy Laws</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Depending on the state, country or region where you are located or reside (your \u201cJurisdiction\u201d), you may have certain

reasonable fee.&nbsp.\nShould you request the deletion of your Personal Data, PCI Security Standards Council will generally do so as soon as practicable, although your right to have your Personal Data

processing of your Personal Data infringes applicable data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection.\nYou may do so in the UK or EEA member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.</p>\n<p>You should note that our servers are located in the United States, which is

our servers located in the United States or in another country outside of the UK or EEA.\nSuch countries may not have similar data protection laws to the UK or EEA or your country.\nIf we transfer your information outside of the UK or EEA in this way, we will take steps to ensure that appropriate security measures are taken with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this policy, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data sent to our Website or Portal is protected by TLS and strong cryptographic algorithms when transmitted across open,
