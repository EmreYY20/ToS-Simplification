the opt-out deadline or that fails to satisfy the other requirements above will not be valid, and You must pursue your Claim in arbitration or small claims court.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Initiation of Arbitration.</strong> Arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is filed unless any

arbitrator will have the power to award a party any relief or remedy that the party could have received in court in accordance with the law or laws that apply to the dispute, subject to any limitations of liability or damages that exist under this Agreement.\nThis agreement to arbitrate involves interstate commerce and is made pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\nsections 1-16 (the \"FAA\").\nAny claim or dispute as to the enforceability of this arbitration provision's restrictions on your right to participate in or pursue a class action or class wide arbitration shall be decided by a court and not an arbitrator.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs</strong>.\nIn the event You file a Claim in arbitration in accordance with these provisions, We will advance all arbitration filing fees if You ask that We do so, in writing, prior to the commencement of the arbitration.\nThe payment of any such fees will be made directly by Us to the AAA.\nSuch requests should be mailed to Equifax Consumer Services LLC, Attn: Request for Payment of Arbitration Filing Fees, P.O.\nBox 105496, Atlanta, GA 30348.\nWe will also pay all arbitrator fees.\nIf Equifax prevails in the arbitration, then the arbitrator shall have the authority to require that You reimburse Equifax for the filing fees advanced, but only to the extent such fees would be recoverable by Us in a judicial action.\nYou are responsible for all other fees and costs You incur in the arbitration, including attorney's fees and expert witness fees, except that the arbitrator shall have the authority to award attorney's fees and costs to the prevailing party.\n(i) based on applicable law.\n(ii) under the rules of the arbitration administrator.\nor (iii) if the arbitrator rules in Your favor and the arbitrator expressly determines that there is a good reason for requiring Us to pay those fees and costs.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Continuation.</strong> This arbitration

termination or changes in Our providing any Product(s) to You.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Small claims court.\n</strong>Notwithstanding anything in this Section, either You or Equifax may bring an individual

You most recently provided to Equifax according to Equifax\u2019s records in connection with this Agreement.</li>\n<br>\n<li>NOT A CREDIT REPAIR ORGANIZATION OR CONTRACT.\nEquifax is not a credit repair organization, or similarly regulated organization under other applicable law and does not provide any form of credit repair advice or counseling.\nEquifax offers You access to Your consumer report and other credit-related information Products, but We do not offer, provide, or furnish any Products, or any advice, counseling, or assistance, for the express or implied purpose of improving Your credit record, credit history, or credit rating.\nBy this We mean that We do not claim We can \"clean up\" or \"improve\" Your credit record, credit history, or credit rating and You acknowledge and agree that You will not purchase, use, or access any of Our Products or the Site for such purposes.\nThese items (credit record, history, and rating) are based on Your past or historical credit behavior, and accurate and timely adverse credit information cannot be changed.\nIf You believe that Your consumer file contains inaccurate, non-fraudulent information, it is Your responsibility to contact the relevant consumer reporting agency, and follow the procedures established by the various consumer reporting agencies related to the removal of such information.</li>\n<li>YOUR RIGHT TO

Equifax and make use of the Equifax Risk Score, which is a proprietary credit score model developed by Equifax.\nThird parties use many different types of credit scores and will not use the Equifax Credit Score to assess your creditworthiness.\nWhen prepared and delivered to You as part of any Product, the Equifax Credit Score is provided for educational purposes solely to help You understand how lenders may evaluate Your overall credit risk.\nTherefore, nothing in any of Our Products is an endorsement or a determination of a person's qualification for a loan, or any other extension of credit.\nEach lender has specific underwriting standards, so You should not assume that You will receive the same evaluation, credit terms or conditions.\nEquifax does not represent that the Equifax Credit Score is identical or similar to any other credit score or score model.\nMoreover, any estimated score changes predicted by Our Products are only estimates and are provided for educational purposes solely to enable You to determine how future financial decisions (e.g., obtaining a new car loan or mortgage) might impact your credit score.\nIn all instances, the information We use to calculate Your Equifax Credit Score is derived from credit information maintained by EIS or one of the other nationwide credit reporting agencies.\nThis consumer credit information reflects the latest information provided to the pertinent consumer reporting agency.\nRecent activity may not yet be reflected in Your consumer disclosure.\nIf not, this activity will not be reflected in Your Equifax Credit Score.\nIn addition, Your Equifax Credit Score may change every time new information is added to or removed from a consumer report as well as with the passage of time.\nYou may obtain a credit score from EIS for a fee without purchasing any Product.<br>\n<br> Please note Equifax Core Credit\u2122 provides You with a VantageScore 3.0, which is a proprietary credit model designed by

overdraft/over-the-limit charges or bank fees triggered by Your order being processed.</li>\n<li>FREE TRIALS.\nCONVERSION TO PAID MEMBERSHIP.\n<strong>Whenever offered, all free trials of Our Products

also result in the unavailability of or disruption of certain Products or Product features.\nIn addition, Your use of a Product that is excessive or in a manner not contemplated by this Agreement may

system error or other problem concerning Your Product, You agree to promptly notify Us of the same, We will try to correct the error, but You will not be entitled to any money for any system error of any type except for monies You paid for Products that We do not provide.\nCertain Product features within the Products may be provided by third parties or may be dependent on data provided by third parties.\nWe may be unable to provide such Product features because the third party will no longer provide the Product features or data to us or will no longer provide the Product feature or data on terms that Equifax believes, in its sole discretion, to be commercially reasonable.\nEquifax will notify you if it is no longer able to offer a Product feature or certain data associated with a

Products offered through this Site consist of membership Products (sometimes referred to as \"continuity plans\") and one-time Report Products.\nUnless otherwise indicated, all Products are subscription-based.\nBy \"subscription-based\" We mean that all such Products and associated Product features are offered pursuant to memberships that automatically renew indefinitely without further action by the Member, and the corresponding membership fee (if applicable) is charged to the Member each subsequent renewal term (monthly or annually, as the case may be).\nSo long as the subscription-based membership remains active, each Member is entitled to all of the features, benefits, and privileges associated with membership until the membership is cancelled by the Member or otherwise terminates or expires.\nUpon cancellation, Member immediately loses access to all of their credit data, analyses or similar information housed within the Site and all other Product benefits.\nAll of Our subscription-based Products renew automatically, but no Product is offered pursuant to terms which prevent the Member from cancelling the Product prior to the expiration of the then-current term.\nAccordingly, YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION-BASED MEMBERSHIP AT ANY TIME BY CALLING OUR TOLL-FREE NUMBER AT 1-866-807-7461 OR BY NOTIFYING US IN WRITING AT EQUIFAX PERSONAL

REQUEST.</li>\n<li>REPORT PRODUCTS.\nIf You purchase a one-time Report Product, the resulting report will be accessible online for a period of thirty (30) days from the date You order the report.\nIf You would like to be able to refer to the report beyond the 30 day period that it is available online, You must print the report within the 30 day period.\nThe report will not update during the 30 day period that it is available online.\nIf You order a Report Product while You are an active Member of a subscription-based Product, You may view the resulting Report Product online (but not update) for 12 months from the date that You ordered the report, provided that You maintain Your membership during that time.\nIf You cancel Your enrollment, Your report will no longer be available as of the date you cancel and You must print the report prior to cancellation if You would like to be able to refer to Your report beyond that time.\nIf you select a purchase option such as Complete Report Pack that features a multi-report product that allows You to order multiple reports for a single price during a defined time period (usually 90 days), You must order all of the reports within the specified timeframe.\nIf You fail to order all of the reports that are available under the multi-report product, You will forfeit your ability to obtain further reports.</li>\n<li>CREDIT MONITORING PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT FEATURES.\nWhen offered or included as part of Our Products, \"Credit Monitoring\" monitors Your consumer credit files maintained by one or more of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies, depending on the type of Product You have purchased (e.g, single bureau monitoring, tri-bureau monitoring, etc.).\nIn each case the credit file or files that are monitored on Your behalf are separately owned and/or maintained by one or more of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies: EIS, TransUnion LLC, and Experian.\nIn the case of all Products which feature Credit Monitoring, the Credit Monitoring You request and authorize monitors the credit file (or files in the case of tri-bureau Products) most closely identified with You based on identifying factors such as first, last, and middle name, date of birth, Social Security Number, and current and former addresses.\nCredit Monitoring will not advise You if an item of identifying information is contained in the credit file of another person and in no event will Credit Monitoring ever monitor, compare or cross-reference Your credit file(s) with the credit file(s) of another person, nor will it ever provide You with any information contained in another person's credit file(s).<br> Your credit monitoring alerts from EIS will usually begin on the day you enroll in an applicable Product.\nIf Your Product also includes credit monitoring from Transunion LLC and Experian, the credit monitoring of credit files at those consumer reporting agencies may take several days to begin.<br> If You order a Product that includes credit monitoring alerts from EIS and You cannot be successfully enrolled in credit monitoring from EIS, We will cancel Your Product.\nIf you cannot be successfully enrolled to receive credit monitoring from Experian or Transunion LLC after purchasing an applicable Product, We will cancel Your Product and in our sole discretion offer You the ability to enroll in a single bureau Equifax monitoring Product.</li>\n<li>IDENTITY THEFT PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT FEATURES.\nCertain Products contain features that may be of assistance to You in helping to prevent, detect and/or respond to incidents involving certain forms of theft or misuse of Your personal information (\"Identity Products\").\n\u201cIdentity Products\u201d do not include identity theft restoration assistance, which is described in Section 23 of this Agreement, and this Section of the Agreement does not apply to identity theft restoration assistance as described in Section 23 of this Agreement.\nWe offer several Identity Products and not all versions of Our Identity Products include the same features.\nPrior to purchasing any Identity Product, You should carefully review the Product Detail Page within the Site that is associated with each Identity Product for a complete list of included features and an explanation of the possible benefits and limitations.\nIn addition, You should also consider the availability of information, tools, and resources that may be available to You without charge or for a nominal fee in the event that You suspect that Your identity has been stolen or compromised, or may be subject to, possible theft or misuse.\nYou can learn more regarding the availability of such resources, by visiting the website maintained by the Federal Trade Commission at https://www.ftc.gov.\nOur Identity Products are information Products that consist of one more Product benefits that deliver information to Members to help them minimize the risk of identity theft and to prepare them to respond in the event that a real and/or suspected act of \"Identity Theft\" should occur.\nFor purposes of this Agreement, \u201cidentity theft\u201d is when your name, address, social security number, debit card, credit card or certain other personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) is stolen, lost, or otherwise used without your knowledge or approval to commit crimes or other fraud in the United States of America.\nThe brief summary provided in this Section is not intended to provide a comprehensive summary of Our Identity Products, nor are the descriptions of Our Identity Products contained in this Agreement intended to provide a complete list of all of the terms, conditions, exclusions and limitations that may apply with respect to any particular Identity Product.\nPlease review the comprehensive Product descriptions and associated Product literature contained in the Site for a more complete description of Our Identity Products prior to ordering any Identity Product.\nBY PLACING YOUR ORDER FOR ANY IDENTITY PRODUCT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT NO PRODUCT IS CAPABLE OF PREVENTING OR DETECTING ALL FORMS OF IDENTITY THEFT.\nYOU ALSO AGREE THAT YOU WILL TAKE REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS TO PROTECT AND SAFEGUARD YOUR PERSONAL AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND AVOID DISCLOSURES OF ANY SUCH INFORMATION TO ANY INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, THAT COULD BE REASONABLY EXPECTED TO IMPROPERLY USE SUCH INFORMATION.\nEQUIFAX AND ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS, AND/OR AFFILIATED COMPANIES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE IDENTITY PRODUCTS AND WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THEY WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THEIR OPERATION WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE.\nNONE OF THE IDENTITY PRODUCTS PROVIDED BY US UNDER THIS AGREEMENT CONSTITUTE A POLICY OR CONTRACT OF INSURANCE AGAINST IDENTITY THEFT AND/OR THE CONSEQUENCES OF IDENTITY THEFT AND OUR LIABILITY TO YOU WITH RESPECT TO ANY LOSSES YOU MAY SUFFER OR INCUR AS A RESULT OF ACTUAL OR SUSPECTED IDENTITY THEFT ARE LIMITED TO THE PRODUCT FEATURES EXPLICITLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THE IDENTITY PRODUCT DESCRIPTION CONTAINED IN THE SITE.\nIn addition, We reserve the right to request that You provide corroborating evidence with respect to any incident of Identity Theft of which We are notified, including signed affidavits, law enforcement or governmental agency reports, or other corroborating evidence, In the event that You fail to provide any requested corroborating evidence, We reserve the right not to provide You with any Product features or benefits normally available as part of Your Product.\nIf You cancel Your Identity Product membership, We are no longer obligated to provide any of the Product benefits associated with Your membership, regardless of whether or not a particular act of real and/or suspected Identity Theft occurred while Your identity Product membership was active.</li>\n<li>IDENTITY THEFT INSURANCE.\nCertain Products include an identity theft insurance benefit for active Members.\nThe insurance limits are different depending on the Product.\nThese identity theft insurance benefits are provided under master group policies issued to Equifax for the benefit of its Members.\nThe complete insurance policies are available from Us on request.\nThe insurance provider administers all claims, and We shall have no responsibility with respect to such identity theft benefit.\nPlease click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to view the policy summary of

providing an aggregate limit of insurance of up to $1,000,000.</li>\n<li>IDENTITY THEFT RESTORATION.\nCertain Products offer identity theft restoration assistance (\u201cIDR\u201d).\nIf Your Product has this feature, You must contact customer care for assistance.\nIn most cases, if your Product has IDR as a Product feature, information about how to contact customer care can be found after you sign in to Your Member Center.\nIf You are receiving IDR through an offering from Your employer, however, Your employer may provide you contact information for customer care and provide other important information and requirements.\nIf you have been notified You are eligible for IDR because of a suspected data breach or security incident, Your notification letter will instruct You about how to obtain IDR and provide other important information and requirements.<br> IDR is offered when You have a qualifying \u201cidentity theft\u201d event.\nFor purposes of this Section, Identity theft is when your name, address, social security number, debit card, credit card or certain other personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) is stolen, lost, or otherwise used without your knowledge or approval to commit crimes or other fraud in the United States of America.\nTo be eligible for IDR, You must be a US citizen or permanent resident.\nYou must also report an eligible identity theft event to Us within ninety (90) days after You first discover the identity theft event.<br>\n<br> IDR attempts to restore Your identity by working with credit bureaus, card issuers, and others.\nThis includes: <ul>\n<li>Explaining Your rights as a victim of identity theft;</li>\n<li>Providing You with an identity theft restoration claims kit in the event you have been the victim of an identity theft event (which you must complete and return);</li>\n<li>Assisting You with placing fraud alerts and security freezes with the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies (EIS, Experian, TransUnion);</li>\n<li>Contacting those entities where the identity theft event occurred, submitting appropriate documentation, and negotiating on your behalf to help resolve the identity theft event;</li>\n<li>Helping You through the process of filing an identity theft affidavit with the Federal Trade Commission.</li>\n</ul>\n<br> Restoring Your identity may not be possible in all cases, and We do not guarantee the effectiveness of IDR.\nIn many cases, We will have to work with third parties to attempt to restore Your identity.\nSome of those third parties, however, may not agree to work with Us.\nIn those cases, We will provide You with instructions about how to attempt to restore Your identity.\nOther third parties may agree to work with Us but only if You also participate in those efforts, such as by participating in three-way telephone calls.\nIn those instances, You agree to participate in such calls and otherwise assist Us.<br>\n<br> For Us to provide IDR, You may be required to provide Us with a Limited Power of Attorney (\u201cLPOA\u201d).\nIf a LPOA is required, it will be included in Your claims kit or otherwise delivered to You and must be returned to Us.\nThis document allows Us to work on Your behalf with creditors, merchants, banks and other entities.\nYou may also be required to provide Us with other documents for certain types of identity theft, such as tax identity theft.\nIn addition, separate and apart from the LPOA, You authorize us to take all reasonable actions on Your behalf to help restore Your identity.\nThis includes (i) providing Us with \u201cwritten instructions\u201d in accordance with Section 2 of this Agreement allowing Us to order and access credit reports from one or more consumer reporting agencies (ii) authorizing Us to take any other reasonable actions for the purpose of providing You assistance and taking other steps that are necessary to work with third parties to help restore Your identity.\nYou acknowledge and agree that You do not have to specifically authorize each action We take, and You further acknowledge that We can investigate the facts and circumstances related to Your identity theft case, including but not limited to contacting third parties by US mail, telephone, and email.\nWe reserve the right to ask for evidence of or related to the identity theft event or related facts, including, for instance, affidavits, police reports, or other government reports.\nIf You do not provide us with requested information or do not cooperate with Us, We will not provide You with IDR.<br>\n<br> In addition, if You have a minor family member who is eligible for IDR as part of Your Product and he or she becomes a victim of identity theft, You may be required to provide additional documentation to verify You are the minor\u2019s guardian, provide proof of the minor\u2019s identity, and be required to submit a LPOA for the minor.<br>\n<br> IDR will not be provided in certain situations, including the following: <ul>\n<li>Circumstances where You suffer a loss directly or indirectly resulting from Your negligence.\nFor purposes of this exclusion, \u201cnegligence\u201d means the failure to exercise reasonable care with respect to the disclosure of Your PII and/or financial account information.\nFor example, You negligently, but willingly, provide Your PII and/or financial account information to a \u201cfraudster\u201d for a service or product, and the fraudster deducts funds from Your account.\nA \u201cfraudster\u201d is defined as a dishonest individual, group, or company that engages in activity to make money by deceiving individuals;</li>\n<li>Circumstances where You suffer no direct or indirect financial losses or are not held responsible for such financial losses attributable to the identity theft event;</li>\n<li>Circumstances where You suffer any loss to an account used for a \u201cbusiness purpose\u201d.\nFor purposes of this exclusion, \u201cbusiness purpose\u201d shall mean any purpose other than for personal, family or household purposes;</li>\n<li>Circumstances where You are unwilling to cooperate with financial institutions, merchants or other creditors, or prosecute or otherwise bring a civil or criminal claim against any person culpable or reasonably believed to be culpable for the fraud or its consequences;</li>\n<li>Circumstances where You suffer losses arising from extortion, blackmail or criminal threats carried out by a person or persons, by means of preventing You from either gaining access to Your financial accounts and/or PII or threatening to destroy such PII where such actions are carried out for the purpose of extorting money;</li>\n<li>Circumstances where an identity theft event is committed or attempted to be committed by Your immediate family member without signature authority on the impacted account.\nFor purposes of this exclusion, an immediate family member includes only one who is Your spouse (or analogous domestic partner recognized by law, such as a civil union), Your child, or the child of Your spouse at the time of the identity theft event;</li>\n<li>Circumstances where You have been accused of a crime, such as where an alleged identity thief may have used your information and misrepresented him or herself to law enforcement as You;</li>\n<li>Circumstances where the identity theft event is caused by or directly or indirectly related to an act of war or warlike action or terrorism, including cyberterrorism;</li>\n<li>For any dishonest, criminal, malicious or fraudulent acts, if You personally participated in, directed, or had knowledge of such acts;</li>\n<li>For any physical injury, sickness, disease, disability, shock, mental anguish, or mental injury, including required care, loss of services or death at any time resulting directly or indirectly from the identity theft event.\nand</li>\n<li>When You voluntarily disclose any code or other security information to someone who subsequently contributes to an identity theft event, provided, however, that this does not include voluntary disclosure due to duress or fraud.</li>\n</ul>\n<br> IDR will also not be provided if You knew about the identity theft before You signed up for the Product.&nbsp;If You cancel Your Product while you are actively receiving IDR, We will not provide You with additional IDR after your cancellation date.<br>\n<br> IDR is not an insurance contract or policy and will not reimburse You or otherwise pay for any costs, fees, damages, financial losses, similar losses or expenses, pain and suffering or any other emotional or economic loss.\nIDR also does not reimburse You for or otherwise pay for attorneys\u2019 fees or other professional fees.</li>\n<li>FAMILY PLAN PRODUCT.\nThe Equifax Family Plan is a subscription-based Product that allows one adult (\"Primary Member\") to purchase a single membership that enables a second adult (\"Added Member\") to enjoy the benefits associated with one of our most common subscription-based Products (Equifax Complete Premier) at a discount to the normal retail price each adult would pay for an individual membership for the Product (Equifax Complete Premier) that corresponds to the features and benefits associated with the Family Plan Product.\nIn addition to these possible financial savings, the Family Plan Product offers two Product features that are unique to Our Products.\nThe first benefit is the ability of either adult to authorize Us (by way of an affirmative opt-in election and authorization that is revocable at any time) to share Alerts that are the result of Credit Monitoring.\nNo other form of credit information or personal information can be shared or disclosed.\nThe second benefit associated with Family Plan is the ability of the Primary Member to monitor up to four (4) of their minor children by means of the \"Child Monitoring\" Product feature described in Section 25 below.\nWhen You enroll under the Family Plan Product (as the Primary Member or Added Member, as the case may be) and authorize Us to share Your Alerts with the other adult Member, You are the \"Subject\".\nWhen the other adult Member makes their Alerts available to You for You to review, You are the \"Reviewer.\" The election to share Alerts under the Family Plan Product is strictly optional and does not need to be reciprocal.\nBy this, We mean that the Shared Alerts option can be configured such that one, both or neither of the adult Members may choose to share Alerts.\nIn no event will You be able to share Your Alerts or view the other Member's Alerts unless We have successfully authenticated Your identity and You have expressly authorized Us (by way of an affirmative and revocable election) to do so.\nThe version of Your Alerts that We provide to the Reviewer, will be the same as the Alerts You see, but no other credit information will ever be shared or made available to the Reviewer, even if You request that We do so.\nYou will not have the opportunity to review the Shared Version of Your Alerts before We share it with the Reviewer pursuant to Your authorization.\nYou acknowledge and agree that when You enable the Shared Alerts capability within the Member Center that You are designating Us as Your agent and giving Us Your \"written instruction\" to obtain from EIS and public records sources the credit file and other information necessary to compile Your Shared Alerts, to create Your Shared Alerts for You, and to make the Shared Version of Your Alerts available to the Reviewer as instructed by You.\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO EXERCISE SOUND JUDGMENT WHEN DECIDING WHETHER AND WITH WHOM TO SHARE YOUR ALERTS, AND YOU AGREE THAT YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH SUCH REVIEWERS, INCLUDING YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE FAMILY PLAN PRODUCT, IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.\nADDITIONALLY, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT NEITHER WE, NOR ANY OF OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS, OR AFFILIATED COMPANIES, ARE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY ACTIONS TAKEN OR DECISIONS MADE BY ANY REVIEWER WITH WHOM YOU HAVE SHARED YOUR ALERTS.</li>\n<li>MONITORING OF MINOR CHILDREN INCIDENT TO FAMILY PLAN.\nIn the event that You (in Your capacity as the Primary Member) successfully establish Your membership in the Family Plan Product, You will also be eligible to enroll up to four (4) of Your minor children for Child Monitoring.\nIf We are unable to successfully enroll You in Credit Monitoring program, Your entire Product order, including any pending orders to perform Child Monitoring for Your minor children, will be cancelled and You will not receive alerts regarding Your minor children.\nChild Monitoring Differs from Credit Monitoring.\nThe monitoring that will be performed for your enrolled minor children is different than Credit Monitoring that is available under Our Products for adult Members who are age eighteen (18) or older.\nOnce Your minor children have been successfully enrolled, We will first determine if an EIS credit file currently exists with respect to each enrolled child.\nIf there is an Equifax credit file for your minor child, We will notify you via email alert within twenty four (24) hours of Us having received the report.\nIf an EIS credit file does not exist for your minor child, an EIS credit file will be established and You expressly authorize and instruct Us to instruct EIS to place a credit lock on each such file, which prevents most third party access to the minor child's EIS credit file.\nEnrollment of Minor Children in Family Plan.\nAs part of Your Family Plan membership, You are entitled to enroll up to four (4) minor children for whom you are the legal parent or guardian by providing the required information and/or documentation including, but not limited to, a valid Social Security number and date of birth for each of Your minor children.\nIn certain circumstances, You may not be permitted to enroll Your minor children on-line.\nIn such circumstances, You will be notified of this event, and We will provide You with additional instructions regarding the steps and additional information needed to take in order for You to enroll Your minor child or children by contacting our Customer Care Center at 1-866-807-7461.\nChildren that have reached the age of seventeen (17) years and nine (9) months are not eligible for Child Monitoring and any attempt on Your part to enroll such a minor child will be denied.\nFurther Certifications or Documents May be Required.\nWe will provide information about a minor child only to a Primary Member who is also the minor child's parent or legal guardian.\nBy enrolling any minor child, You must certify that each such child is under the age of eighteen (18) years of age and You are the parent or legal guardian of each minor child whom You have named on the enrollment forms.\nWe may also require further documentation regarding your status as parent or legal guardian prior to releasing certain information to You.\nBy initiating Child Monitoring, You acknowledge and agree that it is illegal for anyone to obtain credit-related or other personal information concerning a minor child for whom they are not the parent or legal guardian and You further acknowledge and agree that Your enrollment of your minor child requires Us to obtain information about Your child from EIS, a consumer reporting agency, and that any information about Your minor child that You obtain from Us will be used solely for the purpose of assisting You in protecting Your minor child against actual, suspected or potential fraud.<br> Automatic Suspension.\nAny minor children You enroll for Child Monitoring will automatically lose their eligibility to remain under the Family Plan Product within seven (7) days before their eighteenth (18th) birthday and all Child Monitoring will automatically cease on or before that date.\nAfter this occurs, You will no longer be eligible to receive monitoring of any sort regarding that minor child and all other benefits available to You or Your minor child under the Family Plan Product will likewise cease upon the child attaining the age of eighteen (18).</li>\n<li>IDENTITY REPORT\u2122 PRODUCT.\nThe Identity Report Product is a Product that allows individuals to share a verification of their identity and their credit standing with others.\nWhen You obtain Your Identity Report and share Your Identity Report with someone else, You are the \"Subject\".\nWhen someone else makes their Identity Report available to You for You, You are the \"Reviewer.\" When You order Your own Identity Report, You will receive two versions for Your review: a Subject Version and a Shared Version.\nBoth versions will be available to You to view for 30 days from the date that You first order Your Identity Report.\nThe corresponding Subject Version of Your Identity Report will include a snapshot of Your identity information, a high-level summary of Your credit score range (if available), and a copy of Your Equifax Credit Report.\nWe will not provide the Subject Version of Your Identity Report to any individuals other than You.\nThe Shared Version of Your Identity Report will include a summary version of Your identity information and Your credit score range (if available), but will not include Your Equifax Credit Report.\nWe will not make the Shared Version of Your Identity Report available to other individuals unless You decide that You want to share it and instruct Us to do so on Your behalf.\nYou will have the opportunity to review the Shared Version of Your Identity Report before You decide if You want to share it with anyone else.\nYou acknowledge and agree that when You order Your Identity Report, You are designating Us as Your agent and giving Us Your \"written instruction\" to obtain and collect from EIS and public records sources the credit file and other information necessary to compile Your Identity Report, to create Your Identity Report for You, and to make the Shared Version of Your Identity Report available to those individuals as instructed by You.\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO EXERCISE SOUND JUDGMENT WHEN DECIDING WHETHER AND WITH WHOM TO SHARE YOUR IDENTITY REPORT, AND YOU AGREE THAT YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH SUCH INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE IDENTITY REPORT PRODUCT, IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.\nADDITIONALLY, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT NEITHER WE, NOR ANY OF OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS, AFFILIATED COMPANIES, OR AFFILIATED CREDIT BUREAUS, ARE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY ACTIONS TAKEN OR DECISIONS MADE BY ANY INDIVIDUALS WITH WHOM YOU HAVE SHARED YOUR IDENTITY REPORT.</li>\n<li>FINANCIAL ALERTS.\nCertain of Our Products offer You the opportunity to activate Our Financial Alerts feature, which allow Members to receive Financial Alerts concerning certain activity regarding their financial accounts (e.g., checking accounts, credit cards, etc.) These alerts can be customized by the Member to reflect the accounts to be monitored and the thresholds for the creation of alerts.\nIn order to enable Us to provide You with Your Financial Alerts (if available under Your Plan), You must activate this Product Feature and as part of this process, You must agree to provide certain information to Us that is needed in order for Us to access third-party financial websites and the information regarding Your accounts and all financial relationships designated by You (each a \"Third-Party Account\").\nBy providing Us with the foregoing information, You represent and warrant to Us that You are the legal owner of and have the right to authorize and permit Us to access each of the Third-Party Accounts that You so designate, and You expressly authorize Us to obtain and utilize such information solely for the purpose of providing You with Your Financial Alerts.\nBy activating Your Financial Alerts Product Feature, You acknowledge and agree that: (i) Your relationship with each Third-Party Account provider is fully independent of Your relationship with Us and Your use of the Financial Alerts and the Products to which they relate.\n(ii) We do not have a contractual or operational relationship with your Third-Party Account providers.\nand (iii) Our responsibility with respect to the Financial Alerts and the Product to which it relates is limited to solely to providing You with information made available by your Third-Party Account providers.\nAny questions regarding data accuracy with respect to a Financial Alert must be raised directly with the Third-Party Account provider.\nAs a condition of Your activation of the Financial Alerts Product Feature, You expressly acknowledge and agree that We shall not be responsible for any act or omission by any Third-Party Account provider, including without limitation any modification, interruption or discontinuance of any Third-Party Account.\nNOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WHEN WE ARE ACCESSING AND RETRIEVING INFORMATION FROM ANY THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNT IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A FINANCIAL ALERT, WE ARE ACTING AS YOUR AGENT, AND NOT AS THE AGENT OF OR ON BEHALF OF THE THIRD PARTY.\nYOU AGREE THAT WE AND OUR AFFILIATES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RELY UPON THE FOREGOING AUTHORIZATION GRANTED BY YOU HEREIN AND YOU AGREE THAT WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY COSTS, FEES, LOSSES OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF (1) OUR ACCESS TO THE THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS.\n(2) OUR RETRIEVAL OF OR INABILITY TO RETRIEVE INFORMATION FROM THE THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS.\n(3) ANY INACCURACY, INCOMPLETENESS OR MISINFORMATION CONTAINED IN INFORMATION RETRIEVED FROM THE THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS.\nOR (4) ANY CHARGES IMPOSED BY THE PROVIDER OF ANY THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNT.</li>\n<li>SCORE POWER\u00ae AND SCORE WATCH\u00ae PRODUCTS.\nFair Isaac Corporation and Equifax jointly provide certain of the Products available through this
