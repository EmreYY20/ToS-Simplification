obligations.\nThis provision does not require you to indemnify First Look for any unconscionable commercial practice or for First Look\u2019s fraud, deception, false promise, misrepresentation or concealment, suppression or omission of any material fact in connection with the Services.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>11.\nAGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES AND CHOICE OF LAW</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY \u2013 IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS.\nIt contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</strong>\n<strong>\n<em>WE BOTH AGREE TO ARBITRATE:</em>\n</strong> You and First Look agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms through final and binding arbitration, except that, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate First Look\u2019s intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights).\nUnder such circumstances First Look may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>WHAT IS ARBITRATION:</em>\n</strong> Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly.\nInstead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can.\nIf any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>ARBITRATION PROCEDURES:</em>\n</strong> The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision.\nArbitration shall be initiated through JAMS.\nAny dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures in front of one arbitrator.\nIf there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in this Terms will govern.\nThe JAMS Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available from JAMS at http://www.jamsadr.com or 1-800-352-5267.\nTo initiate arbitration, you or First Look must do the following things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(1) Write a demand for Arbitration.\nThe demand must include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered.\nYou can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com.</li>\n<li>(2) Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to: JAMS to your local JAMS office or to JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco, CA 94111</li>\n<li>(3) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules.\nIf travelling to New York is a burden, you may participate in the arbitration by phone or via document submission to the fullest extent allowable by the arbitrator.\nEach party will bear their own costs of arbitration unless the arbitrator directs that bearing such costs would be an undue burden and in that case, we will pay for your portion of the arbitration administrative costs (but not your attorneys\u2019 fees).\nArbitration under this agreement shall be held in the United States in New York, NY under New York law without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.\nThe arbitration may award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive relief).\nAny judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>AUTHORITY OF ARBITRATOR:</em>\n</strong> The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and First Look, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.\nThe arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.\nThe arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and the Terms.\nThe arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.\nThe arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.\nThe award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and First Look.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>NO CLASS ACTIONS:</em>\n</strong> You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action.\nClass arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL:</em>\n</strong> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration.\nArbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.\nIn the event any litigation should arise between you and First Look in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND FIRST LOOK WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>OPT-OUT OF AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE:</em>\n</strong> You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing First Look here with the Subject Line \u201cArbitration Opt Out\u201d and providing the requested information as follows: (1) Your Name.\n(2) the URL of the Terms.\n(3) Your Address.\n(4) Your Phone Number.\n(5) and clear statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision in the Terms.\nThe Opt-Out Notice must be emailed no later than 30 days after the date you first accept the Terms by using the website.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>12.\nWAIVER OF INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF.</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN AN INJUNCTION OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF OF ANY KIND, SUCH AS ANY COURT OR OTHER ACTION THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH OR PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEBSITE, APPLICATION, CONTENT, SUBMISSIONS, PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNED, LICENSED, USED OR CONTROLLED BY FIRST LOOK OR A LICENSOR OF FIRST LOOK.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>13.\nMISCELLANEOUS</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between us and you with respect to this subject matter and supersedes all previous and contemporaneous agreements and communications on this subject, whether written or oral.\nThis agreement is personal to you, is not intended to benefit any third party, and does not create any third party beneficiaries.\nIf any provision of these Terms, or any Additional Terms, is for any reason deemed invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms or the Additional Terms, and the invalidity of the provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of these Terms or the applicable Additional Terms.\nYou hereby waive any applicable statutory and common law that may permit a contract to be construed against its drafter.\nThe summaries of provisions and section headings are provided for convenience only and shall not limit the full Terms.\nFirst Look may assign its rights and obligations under these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, in whole or in part, to any party at any time without any notice.\nYou may not assign these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms to anyone and you may not delegate your duties under them, without the prior written consent of an officer of First Look.\nNo First Look consent or approval may be deemed to have been granted by First Look without being in writing and signed by an officer of First Look.\nExcept as expressly set forth in these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms, (i) no failure or delay by you or First Look in exercising any of rights, powers, or remedies under will operate as a waiver of that or any other right, power, or remedy, and (ii) no waiver or modification of any term of these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against whom the waiver or modification is sought to be enforced.\n</p>\n<p>This agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law.\nYou agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action that you may have arising out of or related to use of the Services or these Terms must be filed by you within one year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.\n</p>\n<p>First Look controls and operates the Services from the U.S.A., and First Look makes no representation that the Services are appropriate or available for use beyond the U.S.A.\nYou agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to these Terms.\nSoftware related to or made available by the Services may be subject to export controls of the U.S.A, and, except as authorized by law, you agree and warrant not to export or re-export the software to any county, or to any person, entity, or end-user subject to U.S.\nexport controls or sanctions.\n</p>\n<p>The sections on Indemnification, Limitation of Liability.\nRelease, and Disclaimers do not apply to New Jersey residents.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>14.\nCALIFORNIA
