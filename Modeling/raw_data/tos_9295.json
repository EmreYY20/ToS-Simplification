Services.&nbsp;</strong>Certain of our Services may be subject to payments now or in the future (the \u201cPaid Services\u201d).\n&nbsp;Please note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing up for a Paid Service are deemed part of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>b.&nbsp;<strong>Billing</strong>.\nSome Paid Services will charge a fee for downloading or installing the Services through the applicable App Store linked to the specific device.\nYou agree to comply with, and your license to use the applications is conditioned upon your compliance with, such App Store terms and conditions.\n&nbsp;Any refunds relating to the applications or inquiries regarding refunds relating to the applications shall be handled solely by the applicable App Store in accordance with such App Store\u2019s terms and conditions.\n&nbsp;To the extent you use other methods of payment for use of the Services, we use a third-party payment processor (the \u201cPayment Processor\u201d) to bill you through a payment account linked to your Account on the Services (your \u201cBilling Account\u201d) for use of the Paid Services.\nThe processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to this Agreement.\nPresently, we use Braintree as our Payment Processor.\n&nbsp;Braintree\u2019s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy can be found at&nbsp;https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal.\n&nbsp;We are not responsible for error by the Payment Processor.\nBy choosing to use Paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your \u201cPayment Method\u201d).\nYou agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method.\nWe reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>c.&nbsp;<strong>Payment Method</strong>.\nThe terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method.\nIf we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>d.&nbsp;<strong>Recurring Billing</strong>.\nSome of the Paid Services may consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you.\nBy choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such Services have an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation.\nWE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY, YEARLY, ETC) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD.\nSUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT.\nTO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD PLEASE EMAIL&nbsp;SUPPORT@NETNANNY.COM</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>e.&nbsp;<strong>Current Information Required</strong>.\nYOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT.\nYOU MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD.\nCHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE ON YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS ON THE SERVICES.\n&nbsp;IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>f.&nbsp;<strong>Change in Amount Authorized</strong>.\nIf the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction.\nAny agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method.\nYou agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>g.&nbsp;<strong>Auto-Renewal for Subscription Services</strong>.\nUnless you opt out of auto-renewal, any Subscription Services you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional rate.\nTo cancel auto-renewal or otherwise change or resign your Subscription Services at any time, go to the corresponding Account Settings on the Services or, for applications, cancel your subscription in the subscription management section of the applicable App Store.\n&nbsp;If you terminate a Subscription Service, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current term.\nyour subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires.\nHowever, you won't be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>h.&nbsp;<strong>Reaffirmation of Authorization</strong>.\nYour non-termination or continued use of a Paid Service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid Service.\nWe may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges.\nThis does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you.\nYour charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid Service.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>i.&nbsp;<strong>Free Trials and Other Promotions</strong>.\nAny free trial or other promotion that provides access to a Paid Service must be used within the specified time of the trial.\nYou must stop using a Paid Service before the end of the trial period in order to avoid being charged for that Paid Service.\nIf you cancel prior to the end of the trial period and are inadvertently charged for a Paid Service, please contact us at&nbsp;<strong>support@netnanny.com</strong>.\n&nbsp;If you do not stop using a Paid Service before the end of the trial period, you will be charged for that Paid Service.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>j.&nbsp;<strong>Changes in Paid Services</strong>.\n&nbsp;The Paid Services fees may change and are subjective to additional fees from time to time if we add new features or functionality.\nWe will notify you by email or some other notification method if a price change occurs.\nIf you don\u2019t agree with these changes you must immediately cancel your use of the Paid Services.\nOtherwise, we will then automatically renew the subscription and charge You at the new fee amount.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>10.&nbsp;<strong>Termination</strong>.\nWe may terminate your access to all or any part of the Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately, which may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with your membership.\nIf you wish to terminate your Account, you may do so by following the instructions on the Site or through the Services.\nAny fees paid hereunder are non-refundable.\nAll provisions of these Terms of Service which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, licenses of User Content, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>11.&nbsp;<strong>Warranty Disclaimer</strong>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>a.\nWe have no special relationship with or fiduciary duty to you.\nYou acknowledge that We have
