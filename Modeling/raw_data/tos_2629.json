any other services we create that are branded as STiBaRC services (such as STiBaRC Messenger), will be referred to as \"the service.\" STiBaRC is also the name of the organization that maintains the service, which will be referred to as \"we\" or \"us.\" \"The website\" refers to https://stibarc.com and any of its subdomains (such as https://messenger.stibarc.com).\n\"You\" refers to a user of

standard server logs.<br>\n<br> Security All user data is stored separate from the website, on a database not accessible to the outside world.\nAll access to the database is logged and is reviewed frequently.<br> If an intrusion is found, all affected users will be notified appropriately and quickly.<br> Information not publicly displayed is not accessible to anyone, even through the API, except to the associated user and us.<br> Your password is never stored in plain text.\nAs soon as it is sent to the server, it is quickly hashed and removed from memory before any other process begins handling the information.<br>\n<br> Cookies We may use cookies on the website and other official STiBaRC software.\nA cookie is a piece of data stored on your device that allows the website to identify a repeat visitor to the site and improve your access.\nUse of cookies is not linked to personally identifiable information.<br> Cookies may also be used by third parties (see \"Tracking\").\nWe do not have access to these cookies.<br>\n<br> Links Official STiBaRC software and user-created content submitted to the service may contain links to third-party websites.\nWe are
