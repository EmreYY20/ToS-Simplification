Managing your account and providing you with our services</p>\n<p>3.2.1 We use your Account Data, Behavioural Data and Channel &nbsp;4+ Account Data (if applicable) to set up, manage and administer your account, to respond to your queries, complaints or comments, to log you into your account and to provide you with Channel 4 and any other services that you request from us.\nIn particular, we use your Behavioural Data to customise your Channel 4 homepage and the ads you see on our site, and to provide you with programme recommendations when you are logged into Channel 4.\nThese are programmes that we think you will be interested in watching based on your viewing history.</p>\n<p>3.2.2 If you have signed up to access our Channel 4+ functionality, we use your Channel 4+ Account Data so we (and our payment processor MPP Global and its sub-processor Global Payments) can process your payments and deal with any related queries you may have.</p>\n<p>3.2.3 We use your Account Data to contact

categories of personal data (such as information about your health, race or religion), you must make sure before you provide this that you are happy for us to use that Voluntary Data for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>3.3 Competitions and surveys</p>\n<p>3.3.1 We use Competition Data for the purposes of allowing you to participate in competitions and to carry out any

Improving our services</p>\n<p>3.4.1 We use Account Data, Behavioural Data, Voluntary Data and Survey Data to help us monitor, analyse and improve Channel 4 (including our Channel 4+

combine all the different types of data that we hold about you in order to build up a picture of you and the types of products and services which might be of interest to you (your Profile).\nWe will use your Profile to provide you with a more customised and tailored experience on Channel 4 and to inform the advertising that is displayed to you.\nThis makes sure that you see advertisements (including personalised advertisements) that are relevant and interesting to you.\nIf you opt out of targeted advertising, you will still see advertising on Channel 4, but this will not be specifically tailored to your interests.</p>\n<p>3.8 Research panels \u2013 for example Core4, Your4 and Dynata</p>\n<p>3.8.1 We use a number of research panels to conduct market research for us which may involve collecting personal data for the purposes of carrying out this research.\nThis collection of personal data by third party research companies (such as Dynata) will be subject to separate privacy policies.</p>\n<p>3.8.2 We use Survey Data to:</p>\n<p>(a) enable us to assess our performance and to improve our products and services including advertising (including for profiling and for building our interest-based ad targeting models);</p>\n<p>(b) inform our marketing and promotional activities;</p>\n<p>(c) inform and support our advertising partners (e.g.\nhelping us to report to them about campaign performance).</p>\n<p>3.9 We may use the personal data of relevant contributors in our programme listings.</p>\n<p>3.10 Archiving</p>\n<p>3.10.1 Channel 4 captures copies of the www.Channel4.com website and Channel 4 microsites to archive data that may be of historical or statistical value and to use this data for internal purposes or to allow third parties access to this data for research purposes, for example if someone is writing a book and the data we hold in our archives is useful for that book.\nOccasionally this may include copies of Voluntary Data that you have provided on public areas of the platform, or if you are contributor, information about you in relation to the programme you were in.\nWe will only ever use personal data in this way that has already been made publicly available.\nWhere possible, when the sites are archived we anonymise or remove personal data.</p>\n<p>3.10.2 We periodically review the data that we keep in our archive and we will delete or anonymise your data held in the archive where we consider it is no longer of value or interest.</p>\n<p>3.11 How we use anonymised data</p>\n<p>3.11.1 We use combined and anonymised data for certain purposes, such as to report viewing numbers of particular genres of programmes and help us understand what type of content users like and to share with advertisers so that they know how effective their advertising is.\nWhen used for these purposes, this data does not enable you or any other individual user to be identified.</p>\n</dd>\n<dt> 4.\nHow do we use your data for marketing and advertising purposes? </dt>\n<dd>\n<p>4.1 Apart from monthly fees paid by users of our Channel 4+ functionality, our programming is almost entirely funded by advertising revenue.\nMarketing and advertising are therefore key parts of our activities.\nThis section sets out the various different types of marketing and advertising that we carry out and how your data is used for each type of activity.\nWe do not serve targeted advertising to registered Channel 4 Users who are under 18.</p>\n<p>4.2 Email marketing</p>\n<p>4.2.1 We will use your email address to send you email marketing (including our newsletter, information about new shows or series you have set a reminder for, rewards and competitions) where you have signed up to receive this from us.</p>\n<p>4.2.2 You can opt out of receiving marketing emails at any time by either following the instructions to unsubscribe in any of our email marketing communications or by changing your preferences in the \"My Communications\" section of your Account Settings.\nIt may take up to 48 hours for your change in preference to take effect and the change will not affect any marketing emails which have already been scheduled to be sent in the future.</p>\n<p>4.2.3 If you opt out of email marketing, we will still need to send you service communications by email from time to time, such as information about changes to our services and updates to our policies.</p>\n<p>4.3 Personalised advertising</p>\n<p>4.3.1 We sometimes use your name, gender, location or your birth month to personalise advertisements that you see on the Channel 4 platform.\nThis means, for example, that you may hear your first name in an audio/video advertisement or see your first name in a text advertisement.</p>\n<p>4.3.2 If you have opted out of targeted advertising, the advertisements you see will not be tailored to you and your interests, but they may still be personalised with your name, gender, location or birth month.</p>\n<p>4.3.3 You can opt out of personalised advertising at any time by changing your preferences in the \"Privacy settings\" section of your Account Settings.\nIt can take up to 72 hours for the change to take effect.</p>\n<p>4.3.4 If you opt out of personalised advertisements without opting out of targeted advertising, you will still see targeted advertisements on Channel 4 but they will not be personalised with your name, gender or birth month.</p>\n<p>4.4 Data Pairing (Enrichment)</p>\n<p>4.4.1 We offer certain data-led targeted advertising products to advertisers, for which we \u201cenrich\u201d the data that we hold on Channel 4 registered users with data held on that individual by third party data providers such as Acxiom.\nThis way, we can see which of our users fall into certain Acxiom segments that are popular with advertisers (e.g.\nsegments based on household composition and interests) and enable advertisers to reach our registered users that fall into these categories on Channel 4.\nWe do not offer these advertising products on iOS or tvOS devices.</p>\n<p>4.4.2 To carry out this data pairing exercise, we use reputable third party data providers such as Acxiom.\nThose data providers obtain personal data about you from publicly available sources and from other third parties who share your personal data on the basis of their legitimate interests or with your consent, in accordance with their own privacy policies and practices.</p>\n<p>We vet data providers to ensure they comply with all their data protection obligations including explaining what they do with your data, keeping it secure and protecting it appropriately.&nbsp.\nWe have a written agreement in place with all data providers we use and we monitor their activities to ensure they are complying with our contractual requirements.</p>\n<p>4.4.3 Data pairing works by sharing your Account Data with a data provider (e.g.\nAcxiom) so that they can enrich our data with personal data that they hold about you.\nIf there is a match, we collect and store the additional Third Party Data (including, for example, the information listed in 2.5 above) in our data warehouse, Mediarithmics, so that advertisers can target specific audiences of Channel 4 users that are comprised of Acxiom\u2019s proprietary segments.&nbsp.\nAdvertisers have no access to Channel 4 user data as part of this process.\nWe conduct fresh database matches on a quarterly basis and process opt outs every two weeks.</p>\n<p>For more information on Acxiom and the data it provides to companies like Channel 4, please visit https://www.acxiom.co.uk/about-acxiom/privacy/uk-privacy-policy/ and you can opt out of Acxiom\u2019s marketing data products here https://gdpr.eu.acxiom.com/managePreference.</p>\n<p>4.4.4 We also conduct data pairing with research companies such as Dynata.&nbsp.\nWe use Acxiom or a third party data matching company, Infosum, to find Channel 4 viewers on their database of individuals who have opted in to receive third party surveys.\nWe enrich our Channel4 data with behavioural information that people have voluntarily provided in response to these surveys.</p>\n<p>4.4.5 You can opt out of data pairing at any time by changing your preferences in the \"Privacy settings\" section of your Account Settings.\nIt can take up to 72 hours for the change to take effect.\nIf you opt out of data pairing, this means that your personal data held by us will no longer be combined with data held by data pairing providers.\nHowever, unless you also opt out of targeted advertisements, we will still use your data to target advertisements to you in accordance with the section headed Targeted advertisements below.\nThis targeting will be based on your Account Data.</p>\n<p>4.5 Database matching</p>\n<p>4.5.1 We use email addresses (and/or other Account Data) to securely match our Channel 4 registered user database with the customer databases of some of our advertisers in order to show their ads to customers / users we have in common when they are logged into Channel 4 (except on iOS or tvOS devices).\nWe never use sensitive data, known as special category data, for this purpose or the data of any of our registered users who are under 18.</p>\n<p>4.5.2 To do this, we usually use a third party matching company called Infosum, which uses proprietary technology to match its clients\u2019 data using secure data \u201cbunkers\u201d.\nBoth Channel 4 and the advertiser upload data into a secure bunker and neither party can access the other\u2019s bunker, nor can Infosum access the raw data in any bunker.\nThe Infosum platform has proprietary controls which allow both Channel 4 and the advertiser to set permissions over their respective bunkers (e.g.\nto allow it to be matched).\nOnce the data has been matched, the resulting list of matched Channel 4 users allows Channel 4 to activate the advertiser\u2019s campaign to those Channel 4 users..\nWe process opt outs on a daily basis and advertisers are required to refresh the data in their bunkers every 28 days during the campaign to ensure good data hygiene.</p>\n<p>4.5.3 When we carry out this kind of ad campaign, we may also use modelling techniques within our data management platform, Mediarithmics, to identify additional Channel 4 registered users that share similar characteristics as those in the target group, such as interests and viewing habits \u2013 who we call \u201clookalikes\u201d \u2013 so that we can target them with the same ad campaign.</p>\n<p>4.5.4 We use email addresses and/or other Account Data to securely match our Channel 4 registered user database with other companies to create a group of Channel 4 users that share similar interests - for example, Channel 4 users who enjoy comedy - in order to ensure our marketing promotions reach the right audiences when they are logged into Channel 4 (except on iOS or tvOS devices).\nWe never use sensitive personal data, known as special category data, for this purpose or the data of any of our registered users who are under 18.</p>\n<p>4.5.5 To do this, we use Infosum (see clause 4.5.2 above).&nbsp.\nOnce the data has been matched, the resulting list of matched Channel 4 users allows Channel 4 to find more relevant promotions for our Channel 4 users.&nbsp.\nWe process opt outs on a daily basis and advertisers are required to refresh the data in their bunkers every 28 days during the campaign to ensure good data hygiene.</p>\n<p>4.5.6 When we carry out this kind of marketing campaign, we may also use modelling techniques within our data management platform, Mediarithmics, to identify additional Channel 4 registered users that share similar characteristics as those in the target group, such as interests and viewing habits \u2013 who we call \u201clookalikes\u201d \u2013 so that we can target them with the same marketing campaign.</p>\n<p>Targeted advertisements on Channel 4 </p>\n<p>4.6.1 If we build a Profile about you (as set out under the section called Profiling above, we will use this Profile to predict what products and services you will be interested in and to target advertisements for these types of products and services to you through Channel 4.\nThese could be our own products and services or those of third party advertisers who have asked us to send their advertisements to certain categories of recipients, including recipients located in a specific geographic area or recipients we have identified are already a customer of the advertiser.</p>\n<p>4.6.2 In relation to advertisements for third party advertisers, when an advertiser is trying to reach a specific target audience, we may create target audiences for these advertisers, such as how many people of a particular age range (e.g.\n18-34 year olds) or in a particular interest group (e.g.\nDIY enthusiasts) or in a particular location (e.g.\nusers who live in Manchester).\nHowever these audiences are not shared with the advertiser in a way that enables individuals to be identified.</p>\n<p>4.6.3 Our third party advanced data platform, Mediarithmics, also provides advertisers with the opportunity to be able to build audience segments for targeting their ads on Channel 4 to individuals using a selection of Acxiom\u2019s proprietary pre-defined segments, such as your household composition, interests and financial status (as described above).\nWe enable them to select the segment names of their choice but they never have access to your data as part of that process.\nWe do not offer this option on iOS or tvOS devices.</p>\n<p>4.6.4 We tell our advertisers how many people in a particular audience have seen their specific advertisements and we provide them with your IP address so they can check that our viewing count is accurate.\nThis process is usually carried out by a company appointed by the advertiser\u2019s advertising agency.\nThis enables those advertisers to assess the effectiveness of their advertising.</p>\n<p>4.6.5 We may also share \u201cpseudonymised\u201d versions of your personal data with certain advertisers in order to help them carry out the targeting of advertisements on Channel 4\u2019s platforms.\n\u201cPseudonymisation\u201d means that the relevant data will be changed from personal identifiable data to a coded version of that data.\nFor example, we create anonymous temporary advertiser IDs for our users that we share with advertisers so they can cap the number of times you see a particular advertisement: however advertisers are not able to identify you from these IDs.</p>\n<p>4.6.6 You can opt out of targeted advertisements at any time by changing your preferences in the \"Privacy settings\" section of your Account Settings.\nIt can take up to 72 hours for the change to take effect.\nIf you opt out, we will still show you advertisements that are relevant to your country, region and city.</p>\n<p>4.6.7 We and other third parties also use cookies to assist in targeted advertising.\nYou can find out more about this in our Cookies Policy.</p>\n<p>4.7 Targeted Advertising on YouView</p>\n<p>4.7.1 If you are a YouView user, we are able to deliver targeted advertising, by dynamically inserting adverts, when you view Channel 4 channels on your YouView Service.</p>\n<p>4.7.2 To do this, YouView generates an ID which relates to your YouView device.\nThis is shared with Channel 4 and used to target advertising based on your Profile and/or your YouView viewing activity.\n</p>\n<p>4.7.3 For YouView users who are also BT customers, BT may also share part of your postcode linked to your BT account to improve the accuracy of the relevant adverts.\n</p>\n<p>4.7.4 We also use the YouView Information to personalise content and viewing recommendations on Channel 4 (both our streaming service and on Channel 4 channels).\n</p>\n<p>4.7.5 You can tell BT to stop providing this information by visiting their privacy settings - https://www.bt.com/privacy-policy/</p>\n<p>4.7.6 You can tell YouView to stop providing you with targeted adverts at any time by visiting the Privacy Settings in your YouView device (if you ask for targeted adverts to be turned off, you will still see adverts but they won\u2019t be tailored to you) - Privacy Policy - YouView.</p>\n<p>4.7.7 You can also opt out of all targeted advertisements by Channel 4 at any time by changing your preferences in the \"Privacy settings\" section of your Account Settings as further detailed in the section called \u201cPreference centre and opting out\u201d.</p>\n<p>4.8 Promoting our own services on other platforms</p>\n<p>4.8.1 We also promote our own content and features via third party platforms, such as social media sites like Facebook.</p>\n<p>4.8.2 This usually works by us sending a hashed or encrypted identifier to the third party platform which is then matched to that third party's records in order to identify whether you are also a user of the third party's platform.\nIf you are identified as a user, this allows us to send you promotions for Channel 4 content and features that we think you will be interested in via your homepage or profile on that platform.&nbsp.\nWe do not do this on iOS or tvOS devices.</p>\n<p>4.8.3 Once we have shown you a promotion for Channel 4 content and features on a third party platform, provided you have consented to the use of any cookies or equivalent technology, we may use a third party service provider to measure whether or not you then access Channel 4.&nbsp.\nYou can choose to opt out of attribution tracking in our Cookies Policy.&nbsp.\nWe do not do this on iOS or tvOS devices.</p>\n<p>4.8.4 We may also make use of Facebook\u2019s business tools.&nbsp.\nThese tools enable us to send event information to Facebook (e.g.\ninformation about programmes that you have watched on Channel 4) so that they can report back to us about the impact of our Facebook marketing campaign on these events.\nThis helps us to evaluate how effective our marketing is in driving programme viewing.\nWe do not do this on iOS or tvOS devices.</p>\n<p>4.8.5 Facebook acts as our data processor when it provides matching, measurement and analytics services to us when we use Facebook\u2019s business tools.</p>\n<p>4.8.6 We are joint data controllers with Facebook Ireland when we share Event Data with Facebook Ireland to help target our marketing campaigns, create custom-made audiences and also improve ad delivery and optimisation of our marketing campaigns on Facebook This enables us to make sure we area reaching the right audiences with our marketing campaigns, which in turn helps us recommend the most relevant programmes to you.\nWe have entered into Facebook\u2019s standard joint data controller agreement in accordance with the terms for the use of the relevant Facebook Business Tools: https://www.facebook.com/legal/controller_addendum.</p>\n<p>4.8.7 Facebook also acts independently as a data controller when it combines our user Event Data with the Event Data from other advertisers to improve and refine its ad targeting algorithm to help it deliver more personalised ads to its users.\nFurther information about how Facebook processes your personal data, including the legal basis Facebook Ireland relies on and the ways to exercise your rights under GDPR against Facebook Ireland, can be found in Facebook Ireland\u2019s Data Policy at https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy.\nMore information about the security measures that Facebook uses can be found here: https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/data_security_terms.</p>\n<p>4.8.8 We rely on legitimate interests as a legal basis for the processing of your personal data for the targeted promotion of our content on third party platforms.&nbsp.\nBy using your data in this way we can ensure that our marketing communications with you will be more relevant, and our campaigns reach the right audiences.\nYou can opt out of receiving this type of marketing on other platforms at any time by changing your preferences in the \"Privacy settings\" section of your Account Settings.\nWe will process this request as quickly as possible but you might continue to see our promoted messages whilst your instruction is being administered.</p>\n<p>4.8.9 Our content might appear on third party sites based solely on your behaviours on these sites (for example, after liking our brand or its content on Facebook), or the behaviours of those within your networks (for example, a friend within your Facebook network likes our brand or its content on Facebook, so it appears in your News Feed).\nThese branded messages are controlled by the third party site, but you may be able to update your preferences to stop these messages appearing in future (for example, you can customise your News Feed in Facebook via \u2018News Feed Preferences\u2019).</p>\n<p>4.9 Broadcaster Sharing</p>\n<p>4.9.1 Sometimes we will also share your Profile, or part of it, with reputable third parties such as other broadcasters to help them to target their own advertising on their own platforms.\nThis helps to ensure that those third parties have as full a picture of you as possible and they can therefore target relevant advertisements to you on their own platforms that you will find interesting and helpful.</p>\n<p>4.9.2 This data pairing applies where you have also shared your personal data with that third party in the course of using their service.\nThe broadcaster then shares your data with us, and we combine it with any personal data we hold about you.\nIf there is a match, we pass the broadcaster the information we hold about you, for example information about your lifestyle, interests and viewing habits.\nThe broadcasters use this information to show you advertisements that are relevant to your interests.</p>\n<p>4.9.3 Those third parties will be responsible for how they use the data that we share with them and how they advertise to you using that data.</p>\n<p>4.10 Push notifications</p>\n<p>4.10.1 If you download the Channel 4 app, some of the communications that we send to you, including marketing communications, content recommendations and information about new content or features, may be sent by push notification.\nPush notifications are messages that pop up on your mobile device.\nYou can choose whether or not to receive push notifications from the Channel 4 app through your device settings.</p>\n<p>4.10.2 If you use an Android device, your device will automatically opt you in for push notifications and you will need to turn these off if you don't want to receive them.\nIf you use an Apple device, you will be asked when you set up your device if you want to receive push notifications and you can choose to receive them then.\nIf you change your mind, you can change your preferences at any time in your device settings.</p>\n<p>4.11 Preference centre and opting out</p>\n<p>4.11.1 You can manage your advertising preferences at any time through the \"My communications\" and \"Privacy settings\" sections of your Account Settings.\nThese sections enable you to choose the electronic marketing and advertising you are happy to receive.</p>\n<p>4.11.2 We will always respect your preferences but please note that it can take up to 72 hours for changes to your preferences to take effect.\nThis may mean that you see some advertising that you have opted out of for a short time after opting out.\nSome advertising campaigns are also set up to run for a particular time and we are unable to change these settings once they are set up.\nIf that is the case, we will make sure that you are opted out of future campaigns, but you may continue to see advertising relating to a particular campaign if the campaign is ongoing at the time you have opted out.</p>\n<p>4.11.3 Even if you opt out of all marketing and personalised/targeted advertising above, we will still show advertisements while you watch Channel 4 based on your broad geographical location, unless you have paid for our Channel 4+ functionality (in which case you will not see any ads in most of the content on Channel 4).\nThese advertisements will not be personalised or targeted to you (other than on the basis of your broad location).\nThey will be standard advertisements that will be served to every user in a relevant country, region or city area, who has opted out of personalisation and targeting of advertisements.\nWe will also still customise your Channel 4 homepage and the promotional clips you see for other programmes on Channel 4, based on your viewing history as we consider this to be an integral part of our service.</p>\n<p>4.11.4 If you want to opt out of receiving push notifications, you need to do this through your device settings.\nPlease see the section headed Push notifications above for more information.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</dd>\n<dt> 5.\n&nbsp;What is our legal basis for using your data? </dt>\n<dd>\n<p>5.1 Data protection law says that we must tell you the legal basis that we rely on

platforms.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5.3 You have the right to object to us processing your personal data for the purposes set out above.\nUnless we can show that we have a compelling legitimate

computer or mobile device when you visit a website or application.\nYour web browser (such as Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome) then sends these cookies back to the website or application on each subsequent visit so that they can recognise you and remember things like personalised details or user preferences.</p>\n<p>Cookies are very useful and do lots of different jobs which help to make your experience on websites as smooth as possible.\nFor example, they let you move between web pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving your

features.\nThey help us to display our advertisements and control how often an advertisement is shown to you, how long it is shown for and how often it will appear (these are commonly known as \"ad-serving\" or \"ad delivery\" cookies).<br>\nSome examples of these essential cookies include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identifying you as being signed in to Channel 4 or other services and keeping you logged in throughout your visit so that you don't need to sign in each and every time you visit.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Remembering security settings, such as parental PIN control, which restrict access to certain content.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Remembering settings across different devices (e.g.\nsynching preferences you set on Channel 4 with your Xbox 360, if you use Channel 4 on your Xbox 360).</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Tracking what content has been viewed so that we can count the number of views and pay the owners of the rights in that content accordingly.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Remembering your preferences and settings such as our \u201cmy list\u201d setting, or your preferred volume setting.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Remembering your place in a video if you leave any of the viewing services before you've finished watching a programme, so that you can pick up where you left off the next time.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Restricting the number of times you're shown a particular advertisement.\nThis is sometimes called \u2018frequency capping'.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Working out when to show you advertisements on any of the viewing services so that you don't get shown too many.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Making sure you get shown advertisements that are part of a sequence in the correct order.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<strong>2.\nStatistics </strong>\n<br>\nIn order to keep Channel 4 relevant, easy to use and up-to-date, we use analytics services to help us understand how people use our website and apps.\nAnalytics services use cookies to recognise your browser or device.\nThis allows us to gather statistics, such as how many individual users we have and how often they visit Channel 4.\nIt also helps us analyse patterns of user activity and to develop a better user experience.\nFor example, we might see that many people who viewed Programme A also viewed Programme B and we can then recommend Programme B to everyone else who viewed Programme A.</p>\n<p>These cookies do not identify you directly as they&nbsp;do not<strong>&nbsp;</strong>collect information such as your name or email address.\nInstead these cookies contain a random sequence of numbers and letters which our analytics services use to identify a unique user.<br>\nWe use information from our analytics services to serve more relevant programme promotions.\nFor example, if you have previously watched a programme about food this information may be used to decide to show you advertisements for other programmes about food, or a later series of the same programme.\nYou can find out more about our advertising and marketing in our Privacy Policy and our \u2018\u2019Your Data\u201d video.<br>\nThe Broadcasters Audience Research Board (BARB), which is an independent body which provides the TV industry with viewing data, has worked with broadcasters including Channel 4 to add a bit of code to Channel 4.\nThis code counts all of the Channel 4 programmes and adverts that people stream or download across TVs, laptops, PCs, tablets and mobile phones.\nThe code does not collect any data which enables individual viewers to be identified.\nThis anonymous Channel 4 viewing data is passed from Channel 4 to a research agency called Kantar (acting on behalf of BARB) and includes what programme or advert has been watched, at what time, for how long and on what type of device.\nThese figures do not contain any information on who is watching or any other personally identifiable information, and do not relate to any other activities apart from Channel 4 viewing.\nIt is solely used by BARB to calculate the total amount of people who watched a programme or advert.\nYou can opt out of this collection of non-personal data for programme and advertisement measurement purposes by requesting that the Kantar cookie (the small bit of code) is not captured.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third party cookies </strong>\n<br>\nAll the cookies described so far in this policy are \"first party cookies\", which means they are set and controlled by Channel 4.\nOccasionally, third parties may set cookies on our Services which Channel 4 does not control.&nbsp.\nThese are called \"third party cookies\".\nThis may happen in the following circumstances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Advertisement impressions: </strong>We work with advertisers to help them make sure that their advertisements are served to people who will find them relevant and interesting.\nFor example, if an advertiser wants to advertise a car, we use information we hold about you and your viewing habits (including the information collected by analytics cookies as detailed above) to decide if you are likely to be interested in an advertisement for a car and, if so, to serve that advertisement for you.\nMore information about this is set out in our Privacy Policy.\nWe do not allow our advertisers to set their own cookies for the purposes of tracking you or advertising to you directly.\nHowever, our advertisers will set a cookie which counts the number of times their advertisements have been viewed, to make sure that their advertisements are reaching enough people.\n&nbsp;This is so they can verify that the view count that we give them is correct.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Embedded content: </strong>On some pages of our websites (for example sites that are specific to one of our programmes, like f1.channel4.com) we may include embedded content, for example from YouTube.\nWhen you visit a page with embedded content, the service provider (for example, YouTube) may set its own cookies on your web browser to track the success of their application or to customise their application to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Channel 4 does not control the use of these cookies and cannot access them, as cookies can only be accessed by the party who originally set them.\nYou should check the third party websites for more information about these cookies.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>HOW TO CONTROL YOUR COOKIES</strong>\n<br>\nThere are various ways that you can control and manage your cookies which are discussed in a bit more detail below.</p>\n<p>Browser Privacy Options</p>\n<p>Please remember that any settings you change will not just affect Channel 4 cookies.\nThese changes will apply to all websites that you visit (unless you choose to block cookies from particular sites).\nThe settings you change will also only apply to the device on which you change them and will not apply across all your devices.\nIf you want to opt out of cookies on all your devices, you will need to change the settings on all your devices individually.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Managing cookies in your browser</strong>\n<br>\nMost modern browsers will allow you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>See what cookies you've got and delete them on an individual basis.</li>\n<li>Block third party cookies.</li>\n<li>Block all cookies from being set.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Delete all cookies when you close your browser.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nYou should be aware that any preferences will be lost if you delete all cookies.\nIronically, this includes where you have opted out from cookies, as this requires an opt-out cookie to be set.\nThis means that if you opt out from cookies and then delete all cookies, your opt out will not be saved and you will need to opt out again (which will store a strictly necessary cookie so that your device can remember that you have opted out).</p>\n<p>If you block cookies completely, many websites will not work properly and some functionality on these websites will not work at all.\nWe do not recommend turning cookies off when using our Services for these reasons.<br>\nThe links below take you to the \u2018Help' sections for

Settings.)&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Innovid</strong>\n<br>\nInnovid cookies help us to make our advertisements interactive and also make sure that advertisements that are part of a sequence are shown

take you to the relevant third party's website and generate a \u2018no thanks' cookie, which will stop any further cookies being set by these analytics services.<br>\n<br>\nDon't forget that by not allowing analytics cookies, this stops us from being able to learn what people like or don't like about Channel 4 and our other Services, so that we can make them

with that website and you should be careful about assuming Channel 4's association or affiliation to anyone else, especially where the existence of that relationship has not been confirmed by us.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.\nWill the Channel 4 Services change?</strong>\n<br>\nThe Content on Channel 4 Services will change regularly, meaning new programmes and channels may become available while

watch our channels online when they are live simulcasts of broadcast channels (but not for watching on demand programmes).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>18.\nWhat are the rules I need to know about user content?</strong>\n<br>\nWe provide users and viewers with an opportunity to participate in shared activity such as contributing to our programmes (e.g.\nvia calls to action on our shows) and online projects via online comments, blogs, social media channels, email and other interactive activity.</p>\n<p>Your participation in and contribution to any such shared activity is governed by and subject to your compliance with our&nbsp;Privacy Policy,&nbsp;Cookies Policy&nbsp;and&nbsp;Competition Terms.</p>\n<p>You will own your user content and may continue to use it, but by posting or submitting this content to us, you allow us (and our third party partners) irrevocably to use your content at our discretion in any media (including on television and online) throughout the world at any time without further liability or payment to you, including to promote our Channel 4 Services or Content.</p>\n<p>Where we do use your user content, we also have the right to change or edit this content.\nWe might also show your name (and, if provided to us, your photograph) with your contribution, in accordance with our Privacy Policy.\nIf you would rather that we did not use your user content, we would kindly ask that you do not post or otherwise submit any user content to us.</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to remove, modify or delete any material you submit to us on becoming aware

to or use the embeddable content, embed code or embeddable player in any other way;</li>\n<li>charge users for access to the embeddable content, or use the embeddable content as a means to secure

acts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>20.\nWhat technical stuff do I need to know about?</strong>\n<br>\nWe will try to ensure Channel 4 is available to you at all times.\nHowever, we do not provide any guarantees about its availability or that we will be able to quickly resolve any technical problems that arise.</p>\n<p>Whilst we seek to make Channel 4 available as widely as possible, some features
