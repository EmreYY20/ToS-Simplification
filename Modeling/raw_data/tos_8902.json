26, 2023</p>\n<p>Welcome to https://oldgate.org (the \u201cSite\u201d).\nWe understand that privacy online is important to users of our Site, especially when conducting business.\nThis statement governs our privacy policies concerning those users of the Site (\u201cVisitors\u201d) who visit without transacting business and Visitors who register to transact business on the Site and make use of the various services offered by Oldgate Studios (collectively, \u201cServices\u201d) (\u201cAuthorized Customers\u201d).</p>\n\u201cPersonally Identifiable Information\u201d\n<p>refers to any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains, including, but not limited to, name, address, phone number, fax number, email address, financial profiles, social security number, and credit card information.\nPersonally Identifiable Information does not include information that is collected anonymously (that is, without identification of the individual user) or demographic information not connected to an identified individual.</p>\nWhat Personally Identifiable Information is collected?\n<p>We may collect basic user profile information from all of our Visitors.\nWe collect the following additional information from our Authorized Customers:</p>\nWhat organizations are collecting the information?\n<p>In addition to our direct collection of information, our third-party service vendors (such as credit card companies, clearinghouses, and banks) who may provide such services as credit, insurance, and escrow services may collect this information from our Visitors and Authorized Customers.\nWe do not control how these third parties use such information, but we do ask them to disclose how they use personal information provided to them by Visitors and Authorized Customers.\nSome of these third parties may be intermediaries that act solely as links in the distribution chain and do not store, retain, or use the information given to them.</p>\nHow does the Site use Personally Identifiable Information?\n<p>We use Personally Identifiable Information to customize the Site, to make appropriate service offerings, and to fulfill buying and selling requests on the Site.\nWe may email Visitors and Authorized Customers about research or purchase and selling opportunities on the Site or information related to the subject matter of the Site.\nWe may also use Personally Identifiable Information to contact Visitors and Authorized Customers in response to specific inquiries or to provide requested information.</p>\nWith whom may the information be shared?\n<p>Personally Identifiable Information about Authorized Customers may be shared with other Authorized Customers who wish to evaluate potential transactions with other Authorized Customers.\nWe may share aggregated information about our Visitors, including the demographics of our Visitors and Authorized Customers, with our affiliated agencies and third-party vendors.\nWe also offer the opportunity to \u201copt-out\u201d of receiving information or being contacted by us or any agency acting on our behalf.</p>\nHow is Personally Identifiable Information stored?\n<p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by Oldgate Studios is securely stored and is not accessible to third parties or members of Oldgate Studios except for use as indicated above.</p>\nWhat choices are available to Visitors regarding the collection, use, and distribution of the information?\n<p>Visitors and Authorized Customers may opt out of receiving unsolicited information from or being contacted by us and/or our vendors and affiliated agencies by responding to emails as instructed, or by contacting us at privacy@oldgate.org</p>\nCookies\n<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor\u2019s computer, and that the visitor\u2019s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.</p>\n<p>We use \u201ccookies\u201d to collect information.\nYou can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.</p>\nAre Cookies Used on the Site?\n<p>Cookies are used for a variety of reasons.\nWe use Cookies to obtain information about the preferences of our Visitors and the services they select.\nWe also use Cookies for security purposes to protect our Authorized Customers.\nFor example, if an Authorized Customer is logged on and the site is unused for more than 10 minutes, we will automatically log the Authorized Customer off.\nVisitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using https://oldgate.org , with the drawback that certain features of the website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>\nCookies used by our service providers\n<p>Our service providers use cookies and those cookies may be stored on your computer when you visit our website.\nYou can find more details about which cookies are used on our cookies info page.</p>\nWhat partners or service providers can access Personally Identifiable Information from Visitors and/or Authorized Customers on the Site?\n<p>Oldgate Studios has entered into and will continue to enter into partnerships and other affiliations with several vendors.\nSuch vendors may have access to certain Personally Identifiable Information on a need-to-know basis for evaluating Authorized Customers for service eligibility.\nOur privacy policy does not cover their collection or use of this information.</p>\nHow does the OGS keep Personally Identifiable Information secure?\n<p>All of our members are familiar with our security policy and practices.\nThe Personally Identifiable Information of our Visitors and Authorized Customers is only accessible to a limited number of qualified members who are given a password to gain access to the information.\nWe audit our security systems and processes regularly.\nSensitive information, such as credit card numbers or social security numbers, is protected by encryption protocols, in place to protect information sent over the Internet.\nWhile we take commercially reasonable measures to maintain a secure site, electronic communications, and databases are subject to errors, tampering, and break-ins, and we cannot guarantee or warrant that such events will not take place and we will not be liable to Visitors or Authorized Customers for any such occurrences.</p>\nHow can Visitors correct any inaccuracies in Personally Identifiable Information?\n<p>Visitors and Authorized Customers may contact us to update Personally Identifiable Information about them or to correct any inaccuracies by emailing us at privacy@oldgate.org.</p>\nCan a Visitor delete or deactivate Personally Identifiable Information collected by the Site?\n<p>We provide Visitors and Authorized Customers with a mechanism to delete/deactivate Personally Identifiable Information from the Site\u2019s database by contacting them.\nHowever, because of backups and records of deletions, it may be impossible to delete a Visitor\u2019s entry without retaining some residual information.\nAn individual who requests to have Personally Identifiable Information deactivated will have this information functionally deleted, and we will not sell, transfer, or use Personally Identifiable Information relating to that individual in any way moving forward.</p>\nYour rights\n<p>These are summarized rights that you have under the data protection law</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The right to access</li>\n<li>&nbsp;The right to rectification</li>\n<li>&nbsp;The right to erasure</li>\n<li>&nbsp;The right to restrict

identifiable information from children under 18 years old.</p>\n<p>If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with Personal Information, please get in touch with us immediately at the contact details provided.\nIf we come to know that children below 18 years have provided personal information, we will delete the information from our servers immediately.</p>\nWhat happens if the Privacy Policy Changes?\n<p>We will let our Visitors and Authorized Customers know about changes to our privacy policy by posting such changes on the Site.\nHowever, if we are changing our privacy policy in a manner that might cause disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information that a Visitor or Authorized Customer has previously requested not be disclosed, we will contact such Visitor or Authorized Customer to allow such Visitor or Authorized Customer to prevent such disclosure.</p>\nLinks\n<p>https://oldgate.org contains links to other websites.\nPlease note that when you click on one of these links, you are moving to another website.\nWe encourage you to read the privacy statements of these linked sites as their privacy policies
