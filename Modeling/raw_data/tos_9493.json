"/html/body/div[1]/div/div[3]", "text": "AdGuard DNS Privacy Policy February 1, 2023 Keynote: We do not share or sell any of your personal data.\nWe are proud to say that we fight for users' privacy and we are strongly committed to this principle and to being as transparent as possible.\nWe believe that privacy is a fundamental human right.\nThat's why we are transparent about what AdGuard does, and explain the purpose of every little bit of information that may be gathered by our apps and services.\nBelow we list all the information that we may collect via AdGuard DNS and explain why we do it and how we use this information.\nThe information we collect includes no more than is crucial to provide the full functionality of AdGuard DNS, both public and private.\nWe do not collect anything for tracking purposes and take all necessary measures to protect the information we get.\nWho We Are ADGUARD SOFTWARE LIMITED (\u201cWe\u201d, \u201cOur\u201d or \u201cUs\u201d) collects and processes your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and in compliance with the applicable data protection laws.\nThis Policy provides you with the necessary information regarding your rights and our obligations and explains how, why and when we process your personal data.\nOur general principle is to collect only the information that is necessary to provide you with full functionality of our products and services.\nADGUARD SOFTWARE LIMITED is a company registered in Nicosia, Cyprus, registered office is at Klimentos 41-43, KLIMENTOS TOWER, Flat/Office 25, 1061, Nicosia, Cyprus and acts as the data controller when processing your data.\nIf you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at privacy@adguard.com.\nWhat We Do AdGuard DNS operates as a DNS resolver which can block access to certain domains, depending on the chosen configuration (server): AdGuard DNS Default blocks access to domains that we consider ad, tracking, or malware.\nThis list is constantly updated based on the community feedback.\nAdGuard DNS Family blocks access to the same domains as Default, and also to domains that may contain adult content.\nIt also enforces safe search and other safe modes wherever possible, which can result in modified search results, missing comment sections, and other differences in web page appearance compared to its original state.\nNon-filtering AdGuard DNS doesn't block or redirect anything.\nIt only returns the IP address of the requested domain.\nPrivate AdGuard DNS blocks DNS queries or modifies DNS responses in accordance with the user\u2019s preferences.\nIn addition to that, it displays the queries and statistics to the user via the AdGuard DNS dashboard.\nRegistering an AdGuard account is required to use this type of DNS resolver.\nWhenever an AdGuard DNS server (except non-filtering servers) receives a request to a domain that\u2019s considered to be an ad or tracking domain, it returns an \u201cunspecified IP\u201d response (<code>0.0.0.0</code>).\nWhenever an AdGuard DNS server (except non-filtering servers) receives a request to a domain that\u2019s considered to be a malware domain, or when an AdGuard DNS Family server receives a request to a domain that\u2019s considered to be an adult domain, it replies with a redirect to a dummy page that explains what has happened.\nIf you disagree with us about classifying a certain domain as advertising, tracking, malicious, or adult one, or if you believe a certain domain should get blocked by one of AdGuard DNS servers, contact us at support@adguard.com.\nWhat Data AdGuard DNS Can Collect And When We do not collect anything about the user specifically.\nIn other words, your IP address or any data about you is not logged.\nWe store aggregated performance metrics of our DNS servers, namely the number of complete requests to a particular server, the number of blocked requests, and the speed of processing requests.\nWe keep and store the anonymous database of domains requested in the last 24 hours.\nThere is no information whatsoever that could link any of these domain names to the original user who sent the request.\nWe need this information to identify and block new trackers and threats.\nWe also log how many times this or that tracker has been blocked.\nWe need this information to remove outdated rules from our filters.\nAll data that we collect is not shared with any third parties.\nIt is used solely for internal purposes such as performance analytics.\nThe only information that we can possibly share is derivatives, i.e.\nlists of domains that our servers recognized as advertising, tracking, or malicious.\nWhen You Are Using Our Website Email address and password you use for authorization.\nThat ensures that you can retrieve your password if needed and that we can communicate with you when we have any announcements to make, service updates to advise or errors to report.\nYou can unsubscribe from our newsletter via AdGuard Account or by clicking \u201cUnsubscribe\u201d in the email itself.\nCookies for personalizing the content of the AdGuard DNS website for users, such as setting the default language.\nNone of the information we may acquire through the use of cookies is considered Personal Data by the standards of GDPR as it does not allow us to identify you.\nYou can always disable or clear cookies in your browser, but please note that some of our services may not function properly without the aid of cookies.\nBilling and payment information.\nIf you buy a subscription to Private AdGuard DNS, we will need to know your contact details.\nWe conduct all transactions via the Paddle payment provider.\nWhen You Are Using Private AdGuard DNS AdGuard DNS users may opt to use the \u201cprivate AdGuard DNS\u201d server.\nThis functionality allows them to control their DNS queries, observe statistics and query logs.\nIn this case, AdGuard DNS will block DNS queries or modify them according to the user\u2019s preferences.\nYour email address which is required to create the account.\nWe store the log of your DNS queries in order to display it to you on the AdGuard DNS dashboard.\nThe users may opt to disable logging via the account settings.\nThe log is only stored for a limited period of time which can also be configured via the account settings.\nHow We Use Your Personal Data We follow EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) which defines personal data the following way: \u2026any information relating to an identified or
