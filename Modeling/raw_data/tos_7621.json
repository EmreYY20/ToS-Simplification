Statement applies regardless of which devices the website is running on.</p>\n<p>The data protection terms used in this Privacy Statement (for example, \u201cpersonally identifiable information\u201d or \u201cprocessing\u201d) can be looked up in the definition catalogue under Article 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as \u201cGDPR\").</p>\n<p>1.2 Data processed by our website includes user data (e.g., first and last names or email addresses), usage data (e.g., for website visits or interest in our products), and content data (e.g., entries in the contact

our website.</p>\n<p>1.3 Users' data is only processed with legal permission or the users\u2019 consent.\nThis means that we only process user data for the purpose of providing our online services on the basis of legal permission or on the basis of prior consent obtained from the user.\nIn this context, we refer in particular to the basis for consent under art.\n6 (1) lit.\nf.\nGDPR, according to which processing may be necessary to safeguard our legitimate interests.\nA legitimate interest may arise in particular from the reach measurement, from the creation of profiles for advertising and marketing purposes as well as from the collection of access data and the use of third-party services.\nConceivable scenarios are the analysis, optimisation, business operation and security of our website.</p>\n<p>1.4 The consent is based on art.\n6 (1) lit.\na.\nand art.\n7 GDPR, the processing for the fulfilment of a legal obligation is based on art.\n6 (1) lit.\nc.\nGDPR, the processing for

destruction and to prevent access by unauthorised persons, we take extensive organisational, contractual and technical security measures, which are regularly reviewed and adapted as necessary.\nHowever, due to the structure of the internet, it is possible that data protection regulations and security arrangements will not be observed by other persons or institutions outside our area of responsibility.\nIn particular, unencrypted data (for example, in an email) may be read by third parties.\nIt is therefore the user\u2019s responsibility to protect the data provided by them against misuse using encryption or by some other means.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>3.\nDisclosure of data</b>\n</p>\n<p>3.1 Data is only transferred to third parties in accordance with legal

address: admin@citizen-europe.com</p>\n<p>4.5 User information can be stored in our Customer Relationship Management System (\u201cCRM System\u201d) or comparable query organisation.\nWe use a CRM system from the provider HubSpot Germany GmbH, Unter den Linden 26, 10117 Berlin, Germany, on the basis of our legitimate interests (efficient and fast processing of user requests) pursuant to art.\n6 (1) lit.\nf GDPR.\nFor this purpose, we have concluded an order data processing contract with HubSpot Germany GmbH, which among other things obliges HubSpot Germany GmbH to process data only in accordance with our instructions.\nHubSpot and its sub-contractors process personal data i.a.\nin the US.\nWe have concluded standard contractual clauses with HubSpot Inc., 25 First Street,

and can present the website to the user in a language version corresponding to the location or provide information and links to online shops or retailers that may be of interest to the user due to their geographical location.\nFor this purpose, we integrate the service GeoIP by MaxMind Inc (14 Spring Street, Waltham, MA 02451, USA), to which the IP addresses of the users are transmitted.\nWe have concluded a data processing agreement with MaxMind and, since the IP addresses are transmitted to the USA, also standard contractual clauses to guarantee an adequate level of data protection.\nThe legal basis is art.\n6 (1) lit.\nf GDPR, our legitimate interest is to be able to show users relevant content.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>7.\nCookies and Reach

small files or other types of information storage.</p>\n<p>7.2 We use session cookies, which are only stored for the duration of the visit to our website (for example, to enable storage of the login status and thus the use of our website in the first place).\nIn a session cookie, a randomly generated unique identification number is stored, which is know as a session ID.\nIn addition, a session cookie contains information about its origin and the retention period.\nSession cookies cannot save other data.\nSession cookies are deleted when the use of our website is ended (for example, by

regarding activities within our website and to provide us with additional services related to the use of our website and internet usage.\nIn the process, pseudonymous user profiles can also be created from the processed data.\nThis is independent from the configuration of marketing functions of Google Analytics which we also use on this website and which are described in section 9.3 below.</p>\n<p>8.1.3 We only use Google Analytics with IP anonymisation activated.\nThis mean the user\u2019s IP address will be abridged by Google within the Member States of the European Union or in other states parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.\nThe full IP address is only sent to a Google server in the U.S.\nand truncated there in exceptional cases.\nTo cover these exceptional cases where personal data is transferred to the US Google has concluded standard contractual clauses pursuant to art.\n46 GDPR.</p>\n<p>8.1.4 Google will not merge the IP address provided by your browser with other data.\nUsers may prevent cookies from being stored by making relevant settings in their browser software.\nUsers can also prevent the recording of the data generated by the

online offer pursuant to art.\n6 (1) lit.\nf.\nGDPR we use HubSpot, a service of HubSpot, Inc., 25 First Street, 2nd Floor, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA, on our website.\nThe functions include email marketing (more on this in section 10 Newsletters), reporting, contact management, landing pages and contact forms for marketing and analysis purposes.</p>\n<p>8.2.2 This involves the use of so-called \"web beacons\" and also the setting of \"cookies\" which are stored on the user's computer and which enable us to analyse their use of the website.\nData such as IP address, geographical location, browser type, duration of the visit and pages viewed are collected and evaluated by HubSpot on our behalf in order to generate reports about the visit and the pages visited on our website.\nAs personal data is transferred to the US as part of the processing via HubSpot, we have concluded standard contractual clauses with HubSpot in addition to a data processing agreement to ensure an adequate level of data protection.</p>\n<p>8.2.3 If a collection by HubSpot is generally not desired, the storage of cookies can be prevented at any time by appropriate browser settings (see section

the case of processing in third countries) have been agreed between Yandex Oy and YANDEX LLC, 16 Lva Tolstogo st., Moscow, 11 902 1, Russia, which is responsible for processing the data.</p>\n<p>8.3.2 We use Yandex.Metrica with IP anonymisation activated.\nThis means that Yandex.Metrica replaces the last octet of an IPv4 address or the last 64 bits of an IPv6 address with zeros, so that an incomplete address is registered in the system.</p>\n<p>8.3.3 Yandex.Metrica's session replay tool is configured for use on our website to automatically mask fields where personal data may be entered.</p>\n<p>8.3.4 Yandex.Metrica opt-out add-on</p>\n<p>By default, Yandex.Metrica collects information about all visitors to our website.\nHowever, data collection can be blocked by individual

consent pursuant to art.\n6 (1) lit.\na.\nGDPR for marketing and optimisation purposes.\nAs a transfer of personal data to the USA may take place, we have agreed standard contractual clauses with Facebook pursuant to art.\n46 (2) lit.\nc.\nGDPR to ensure an adequate level of data protection.\nInformation on the data security can be found here: https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/data_security_terms.\nInformation on the processing based on standard contractual clauses can be found here: www.facebook.com/legal/EU_data_transfer_addendum.</p>\n<p>9.1.2 We use Facebook Pixel for remarketing purposes (Facebook (Website) Custom Audiences) to be able to display interest-based advertisements (\"Facebook Ads\") to users of our website again within 180 days if they visit the social network \"Facebook\" or other websites also using this process and to make our website and our offers more interesting.</p>\n<p>9.1.3 With the help of Facebook Pixel, we can also track the effectiveness of the Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes because it allows us to see whether users were redirected to our website after clicking on a Facebook ad (\"conversion\").</p>\n<p>9.1.4 Due to the Facebook Pixel, the user's browser automatically establishes a direct connection with Facebook\u2019s servers as soon as the user has agreed to the use of cookies.\nFacebook then receives the information that the user has called up our website or clicked on an advertisement.\nIf a user has a Facebook account and is logged in, Facebook can assign the visit to the user's account.\nFurther information on data protection at Facebook: www.facebook.com/about/privacy.\nFurther information on Facebook Pixel: www.facebook.com/business/help/651294705016616</p>\n<p>9.1.5 Logged-in Facebook users can object to the collection of data by Facebook Pixel and the use of their data to display Facebook Ads.\nUsers can make the relevant settings as to which types of advertisements are displayed to them within Facebook on the Facebook website: www.facebook.com/settings.\nPlease note that this setting will be deleted when the user deletes the cookies.</p>\n<p>9.1.6 For the collection and transfer of data as part of this process, we are jointly responsible with Facebook Ireland Ltd, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland within the meaning of art.\n26 GDPR.\nThis applies to the creation and optimisation of interest-based ads.\nThe processing that takes place after collection and transfer is the sole responsibility of Facebook.\nFor the joint responsibility, we have concluded a corresponding agreement with Facebook, which can be accessed here: www.facebook.com/legal/controller_addendum.\nThis agreement sets out the respective responsibilities for fulfilling the obligations under the GDPR with regard to joint responsibility.\nAmong other things, the agreements say that, irrespective of the allocation of responsibilities in the agreement, Facebook can be used as a contact point for the assertion of data subject rights.\n</p>\n<p>The contact details of the data controller and the data protection officer of Facebook can be found here: www.facebook.com/about/privacy.</p>\n<p>9.1.7 The preparation of reports and analyses in aggregated and anonymised form is carried out as part of commissioned processing and is therefore our responsibility.</p>\n<p>We transmit the data within the scope of joint responsibility based on legitimate interest pursuant to art.\n6 (1) lit.\nf.\nGDPR.</p>\n<p>9.1.8 Lifetime of cookies: up to 180 days after the last interaction (this only applies to cookies set via this website).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>9.2 Google Ads</b>\n</p>\n<p>9.2.1 Google Ads Conversion</p>\n<p>On the basis of consent pursuant to art.\n6 (1) lit.\na.\nGDPR, we use the Google Ads Conversion service to advertise our services on external websites and to determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.</p>\n<p>Google delivers these ads via so-called \"Ad Servers\".\nThis is done with the help of Ad Server Cookies, which can be used to measure certain parameters for measuring success, such as the display of ads or clicks by users.\nIf a user accesses our website via a Google Ad, Google Ads stores a cookie on the user's device.\nThese cookies usually lose their validity after 30 days and are not used to identify the user personally.\nThe unique cookie ID, number of ad impressions per placement (frequency), last impression (relevant for post-view conversions) and opt-out information (marking that the user no longer wishes to be addressed) are usually stored as analysis values for this cookie.</p>\n<p>These cookies enable Google to recognise a user's internet browser.\nIf a user visits certain pages of an Ads client's website and the cookie stored on their computer has not yet expired, Google and the client can recognise that the user has clicked on the ad and been redirected to that page.\nThe (custom) cookies cannot be tracked via Ads customers' websites.\nWe ourselves do not collect and process any personal data in the aforementioned advertising measures and only receive statistical evaluations from Google.\nFrom these, we can see which of the ads used are particularly effective.</p>\n<p>Due to the marketing tools used, the user's browser automatically establishes a direct connection with Google's server.\nWe have no influence on the scope and further use of the data collected by Google through the use of this tool.\nAs far as we are aware, the integration of Ads Conversion provides Google with the information that the user has called up the relevant part of our website or clicked on one of our advertisements.\nIf the user is registered with a Google service, Google can assign the visit to their account.\nEven if the user is not registered with Google or has not logged in, it is still possible for the provider to obtain and store the user's IP address.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>9.2.2 Google Ads Remarketing</p>\n<p>On the basis of consent in accordance with art.\n6 (1) lit.\na.\nGDPR, we use the remarketing function within the Google Ads service.\nWith the remarketing function, we can show users of our website interest-based advertising on other websites within the Google advertising network (in Google Search or on YouTube, so-called \"Google Ads\" or on other websites).\nFor this purpose, the interaction of users on our website is analysed, e.g., which offers the user was interested in, to be able to display targeted advertising to users on other sites even after they have visited our website.\nFor this purpose, Google stores cookies on the end devices of users who visit certain Google services or websites in the Google display network.\nThese cookies are used to record the visits of these users.\nThe cookies are used to uniquely identify a web browser on a particular device and not to identify a person.</p>\n<p>Further information on data protection at Google can be found here: www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy and services.google.com/sitestats/de.html.</p>\n<p>Transfers to third countries are possible.\nSo-called standard contractual clauses pursuant to art.\n46 GDPR have been concluded as suitable guarantees.</p>\n<p>Cancellation/revocation: Users can prevent participation in this tracking procedure in various ways: By an appropriate setting of the browser software, in particular the suppression of third-party cookies leads to the user not receiving ads from third-party providers, by installing the plug-in provided by Google at the following link: www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin, by deactivating the interest-based ads of the providers that are part of the self-regulation campaign \"About Ads\" via the link www.aboutads.info/choices, whereby this setting is deleted when the user deletes cookies on the end device, by means of the corresponding cookie setting in our consent management tool Usercentrics.\nWe would like to point out that in this case not all functions of this website may be fully available.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>9.3 Google Analytics Advertising Functions</b>\n</p>\n<p>9.3.1 We use Google Analytics advanced features on this website in addition to the standard features.\nThe Google Analytics advertising features implemented on this website include: Google Display Network Impressions reports.\nGoogle Analytics Performance by Demographics and Interests reports.\nIntegrated Services for which Google Analytics collects data for advertising purposes, including the collection of data via cookies for ad preferences and anonymous identifiers.\nEvent Tracking.\nFor this purpose, in addition to the data collected by the Google Analytics analysis tool, further data is collected via Google cookies for ad preferences and anonymous identifiers on accesses.\nWe use this information to improve our website.</p>\n<p>9.3.2 Users can prevent the use of Google Ads and Google Analytics advertising functions by making the appropriate setting in their browser, via the Google Ads settings at www.google.com/ads/preferences/, in our consent management platform Usercentrics or by deactivating them on the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) website at www.networkadvertising.org.\nWe would like to point out that in this case not all functions of this website may be fully available.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>9.4 Google Tag Manager</b>\n</p>\n<p>This website uses Google Tag Manager, a service by Google Ireland Ltd, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin, Ireland, based on consent pursuant to art.\n6 (1) lit.\na.\nGDPR, Dublin 4, Ireland.\nSo-called standard contractual clauses pursuant to art.\n46 GDPR have been concluded with this service provider as suitable guarantees to ensure an appropriate level of data protection.</p>\n<p>Google Tag Manager allows marketers to manage website tags via an interface.\nThe tool itself (which implements the tags) is a cookie-less domain and does not store any personal data.\nThe tool takes care of triggering other tags, which in turn may collect data.\nGoogle Tag Manager does not access this data.\nIf a deactivation has been made at the domain or cookie level, this remains in place for all tracking tags implemented with Google Tag Manager.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>9.5 LinkedIn Analytics and LinkedIn Ads</b>\n</p>\n<p>We use the conversion tracking technology and the retargeting function of LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland on our website based on consent pursuant to art.\n6 (1) lit.\na.\nGDPR.</p>\n<p>With the help of this technology, visitors to this website can be shown personalised advertisements on LinkedIn.\nFurthermore, it allows to create anonymous reports on the performance of the advertisements as well as information on website interaction.\nFor this purpose, the LinkedIn Insight tag is integrated on this website, which establishes a connection to the LinkedIn server for users who are logged into their LinkedIn account at the same time.</p>\n<p>Further information on data collection and use and on the options and rights to protect

described.</p>\n<p>10.2 Content of the newsletter: We only send newsletters, emails and other electronic notifications containing advertising information (hereinafter \u201cnewsletter\u201d) based on the recipient\u2019s (user\u2019s) consent within the meaning of art.\n6 (1) lit.\na.\nGDPR or any other legal permission.\nIf the contents of the newsletter are outlined specifically upon registration, these are authoritative for users\u2019 consent.\nIn all other cases, our newsletters contain information regarding our products, offers, promotions and our company.</p>\n<p>10.3 Double opt-in and logging: Registration for our newsletter is performed using a double opt-in procedure.\nThis means that after signing up, the user will receive an email to their email address asking them to confirm their registration.\nThis confirmation is necessary so that nobody can register with third-party email addresses.\nThe registration for the newsletter will be logged to prove that the registration process complies with legal requirements.\nThis includes the storage of the login and the confirmation time, as well as the IP address.\nChanges in the data stored with the shipping service provider are also logged.</p>\n<p>10.4 The newsletter is distributed via the service provider Hubspot Ireland Limited, Ground Floor, Two Dockland Central, Guild St, North Dock, Dublin, D01 R8H7 Dublin (\u201cHubspot\u201d) who receives the user data provided upon sign up.\nThe data provided by the use (e.g., email address) is stored on servers in Germany.\nHubSpot uses this information to send the newsletter and analyse interactions with the newsletter on our behalf.\nAs it is possible that personal data is transferred to the US, we have concluded standard contractual clauses pursuant to art.\n46 GDPR in addition to a data processing agreement with the service provider, who in addition is certified under the Privacy Shield, to ensure an adequate level of data protection in the recipient country.</p>\n<p>10.5 According to its own statements, the marketing automation service provider may use the data in a pseudonymised form, meaning without assignment to a user, for the optimisation or improvement of their own services (e.g., for the technical optimisation of mailouts and the display of newsletters or for statistical purposes to determine which countries the recipients come from).\nHowever, the marketing automation service does not use the newsletter recipients\u2019 data to write to them itself or pass this data on to third parties.</p>\n<p>10.6 Registration data: To sign up for the newsletter, the user only needs to provide their email address.\nWe request the user to optionally provide their name so that they may be addressed personally in the newsletter.</p>\n<p>10.7 Statistical survey and analyses: For evaluation purposes, the emails sent contain so-called web beacons or tracking pixels, which are single-pixel image files stored on our website.\nThis makes it possible to determine whether a newsletter message has been opened and which links, if any, have been clicked on.\nWith the help of so-called conversion tracking, it can also be analysed whether a predefined action (e.g., the purchase of a product on our website or the filling out of a form) has taken place after clicking on the link in the newsletter.\nIn addition,
