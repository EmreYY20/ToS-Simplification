Services, or when you interact with emails, advertisements, or other electronic messages we send to you through the Services.\nThis information may include your IP address, device characteristics (including device identifiers), web browser characteristics, unique identifiers and other data stored in cookies, operating system details, language preference, referring URLs, length of visits, pages viewed, and other information that may be automatically accessible to us from your browser or device.</p>\n<p>We and our vendors may automatically collect this information using various tools and technologies such as cookies, web server logs, tags, SDKs, tracking pixels, local storage, JavaScript, APIs, session replay/screen capture (i.e., how you use and navigate the services, but not your keystroke data), and other similar technologies.&nbsp.\nAdditional information on other technologies we may use is set forth below.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nWhat is a cookie? A cookie is a piece of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your device, sometimes with a code unique to your device.\nCookies enable us and our vendors to (i) recognize your computer.\n(ii) store your preferences, settings, and other data.\n(iii) understand the web pages you have visited on our Services and elsewhere.\n(iv), enhance your user experience by delivering and measuring the effectiveness of content and advertising tailored to your interests.\n(v) perform searches and analytics.\nand (vi) assist with security and administrative functions.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nWhat is a web server log? A web server log is a file where online activity is stored.&nbsp.\nIt may be used for similar purposes.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nWhat\u2019s an SDK? An SDK is a set of tools and/or code that we embed in our applications and software to perform certain functions, such as allowing us or third parties to collect information about how users interact with our Services.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nWhat are Tags or tracking pixels? Tags or tracking pixels (sometimes also referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are small code (sometimes containing, generating, or detecting a unique identifier) embedded in websites, online ads, and email, that can be used for purposes such as generating web server logs or reading or writing cookies for the purposes described above.</p>\n<p>As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather information through other methods.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We may also use certain third-party web and mobile app analytics services \u2013 including but not limited to Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, Twitter Analytics, and Facebook Custom Audiences \u2013 to help us understand and analyze how visitors use the online Services and serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and in different channels (including on the web, in mobile apps, on out-of-home digital surfaces, and in connected TV apps.\nWe\u2019ve implemented Google Analytics Advertising features such as&nbsp;remarketing with analytics, interest-based advertising, demographics and interests reporting, user segment analysis, look-alike modeling and impression reporting.\nWe and third-party vendors may use first-party cookies or other first-party identifiers as well as third-party cookies or other third-party identifiers to provide Chipotle with insight into behavior information relating to inferred visitor age range (e.g., GenZ, Millenial, GenX, etc.), your interests, and&nbsp;to deliver advertisements to you, create a profile of you, measure your interests, detect your demographics, detect your location, personalize content, and detect and associate online and offline behaviors such as site visitation, dwell time and actions taken.\nFor more information on how the Google Marketing Platform uses the data collected through the online Services, visit:&nbsp;<b>www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</b>.</p>\n<p>In addition to the automatic collection mechanisms listed above, we may also:</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nAs an advertising publisher, use tags in connection with the Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings Service for Google Ad Manager;</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nThrough tracking technologies, receive and use Foursquare service user data, including search terms, what pages you view, your access times, the time you spend on each page, the IP address used to access the pages, and other user data (<i>see&nbsp;</i>\n<b>Foursquare Privacy Policy</b>).\nand</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nUse Microsoft\u2019s Bing Universal Event Tracking (UET) feature, in which case Microsoft collects your personal information (<i>see&nbsp;</i>\n<b>Microsoft Privacy Statement</b>).</p>\n<p>Depending on your personal device and App permission settings, when using the App, we may collect or have access to your:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Precise geolocation.</b>&nbsp;When you give the App permission to do this, the App may use your mobile device\u2019s location services to collect real-time information about the location of your device (using both GPS and other methods) to provide requested location services, ensure your orders are placed at the correct location, and to serve you relevant offers or promotions.\nHowever, Chipotle does not retain or store your precise location when you enable sharing this information on your mobile device.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Camera.</b>&nbsp;When enabled, this may allow the App to access the camera to scan and input payment method details.\nProviding access to your Camera function is entirely optional.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Wi-Fi connection information.</b>&nbsp;When enabled, this may allow the App to view Wi-Fi connections.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Other.</b>&nbsp;The App will send and receive data to and from the Internet, and may view network connections, have full network access, control vibration of your device, or prevent your device from sleeping.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may be able to enable or disable geolocation collection by the App by adjusting the permissions in your account or device settings.\nIf GPS precise location services are disabled, other means of establishing or estimating location (e.g., connecting to or proximity to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, beacons, or our networks) may still be active.\n&nbsp;networks generally</p>\n<p>Some of the technology described above is used by us or our partners to correlate information collected about you over time across two or more websites or online services.</p>\n<p>Please review Section 7 (\u201cYour Choices\u201d) for additional information about how you can manage the use of these technologies.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Information Collected From Third Parties</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>Our vendors and other third parties may share with us your personal information.\nFor example, if you order food or catering, order gift cards, make a purchase for merchandise, make a payment, or provide feedback on your experiences, you may submit personal information to one or more third parties that may share your information with us.</p>\n<p>In some circumstances, we also may collect information about you from publicly-available sources, including content about our Services that you make publicly available on third-party websites (e.g., social media platforms).&nbsp.\nWe or vendors assisting us may also receive information from geolocation data providers to help us understand aggregate visit patterns in restaurant markets of interest, but these providers get the location data from sources other than our own App and websites.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Additionally, for certain features of the online Services, you may log in through your third-party social media account or share content from the online Services through third-party social media platforms.\nWe may combine information that we have about you with information we obtain from third parties.\nWhen you submit information to a third party, you are subject to that third party\u2019s terms of use and privacy policies, for which we are not responsible.</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nUSE OF INFORMATION</b>\n</p>\n<p>We may use personal information we obtain about you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>facilitate and personalize your user experience

above) may view, edit, or set their own tracking technologies/cookies, some of which collect personal information.</p>\n<p>We may also share, including by publicly posting on our online Services or other public online locations, certain content about us or our Services that you submit to us or otherwise make publicly available.&nbsp.\nFor example, we may repost content that you post about us on social media.</p>\n<p>In the event of a business transaction, such as if we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (e.g., further to a merger, reorganization, liquidation, or any other business transaction, including negotiations of such transactions), we reserve the right to disclose any information we obtain through the Services.\nYou acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy.&nbsp.\nTo the extent legally permitted, the acquiring party may use the information pursuant to their own privacy policy instead of this one.</p>\n<p>We may also disclose personal information when required by subpoena, search warrant, or other legal processes, or in response to activities that are unlawful or a violation of Chipotle\u2019s rules for use of the Services, or to protect and defend the rights or property of Chipotle or others.&nbsp.\nThis may involve the disclosure of personal information to law enforcement, other governmental

information applicable to California residents under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Collection, Use, and Disclosure of California Personal

(\u201c<b>\n<i>Collection of Information</i>\n</b>\n<i>\u201d</i>)<i>&nbsp;</i>of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp.\nDuring that period, we made the following disclosures of personal information about

CCPA), commercial information (transaction data), payment card information, and internet or other network or device activity (like a record of a browser\u2019s visit to our website) to market and advertise services to assist with such activities.&nbsp.\nWe do not \u201csell\u201d personal information if we have actual knowledge that the consumer is less than 16 years of age.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Your CCPA Information &amp.\nDeletion Rights</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>The CCPA allows you to request us to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inform you about the categories of personal information we collect or disclose about you.\nthe categories of sources of such information.\nthe business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information.\nand the categories of third parties with whom we share/disclose personal&nbsp;information.</li>\n<li>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain personal information we hold about you.</li>\n<li>Delete certain personal information we have about&nbsp;you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you may submit your request by completing our&nbsp;CCPA Data Request Form&nbsp;or contacting us by phone at 833-506-0473.</p>\n<p>Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under California law.\n&nbsp;For example, we need certain information to provide our Services to you.&nbsp.\nWe also will take reasonable steps verify your identity before responding to your request, which may include, at a minimum, depending on the sensitivity of the information you are requesting and the type of request you are making, verifying your name, email address, and other information regarding your use of the Services (e.g., date of last purchase or last 4 digits of a payment/gift card).\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While you have the right to make a deletion request at any time, kindly note that processing this right would cause you may lose any promotional offers that would have been provided as a result of maintaining your deleted Chipotle Rewards account.&nbsp.\nThis may include any benefit provided through the exclusive use of Rewards account, like any accrued points, prizes, and promotional coupons.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Your CCPA Right to Opt Out of \u201cSale\u201d of Personal Information</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>Californians have a right to direct us not to \u201csell\u201d certain personal information as that term is defined in under the CCPA.&nbsp.\nYou can exercise that right by performing BOTH of the following steps:</p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nFollow the instructions on our&nbsp;CCPA Do Not Sell Request Form</p>\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nOR contact us by phone at 833-506-0473 to make a general do-not-sell request.\nWe may take reasonable steps to verify the validity of your request.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Requests Made by Agents</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>If you are an agent making a request on behalf of a consumer, we reserve the right to take steps to verify that you are authorized to make that request, which may include requiring you to provide us with written proof such as a notarized authentication letter or a power of attorney, as stipulated applicable state law.&nbsp.\nAs part of the process, we may additionally require the customer to verify their identity directly with us.\nFor security and legal reasons, Chipotle will reject requests that require us to access third-party websites or services.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because opt-out requests for sales made through cookies and related technology must be performed from each browser that is used to access our Services, it is easiest for the consumer to perform such opt-outs themselves.&nbsp.\nHowever, if a consumer wishes for an agent to perform browser-based requests on their behalf, the consumer may arrange for the agent to use the consumer\u2019s browser to make such requests.&nbsp.\nWe are not responsible for the security risks of this or any other arrangements that a consumer may have with an agent.&nbsp.\nFor clarity, this is not permission for any user to share their login credentials with an agent or any third party.&nbsp.\nSuch sharing is a violation of our Terms of Use and is not required for an agent to make requests under this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Nondiscrimination</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>You also have the right not to receive \u201cdiscriminatory treatment\u201d (within the meaning of the CCPA) for exercising CCPA rights.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Notice of Financial Incentives</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>The Chipotle Rewards Program lets participants earn or otherwise receive rewards (e.g., free entrees) and discounts, in return for registering and/or making purchases, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend-based incentives, where you earn credit based upon spend levels</li>\n<li>Discounts and free products offered for frequent visitors&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Periodic promotional discounts and offers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can sign up for the Rewards Program by&nbsp;registering on our website&nbsp;or through the Chipotle app.\n&nbsp;Registration requires you to provide your name, email address, telephone number, and (optionally) your day and month of birth.&nbsp.\nWe will then associate that and other categories of personal information with your Rewards Program account, such as other unique identifiers, purchase history, geolocation data, preferences you provide (e.g., favorite Chipotle restaurants), and stored payment methods.&nbsp.\nNote that we also may collect all of this information outside the context of the Rewards Program.</p>\n<p>Full terms for the Rewards Program are available&nbsp;here.</p>\n<p>You may withdraw from the Rewards Program at any time and forfeit any ongoing incentives by contacting us using the contact information below.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\nWhile we do not and cannot assign a monetary value to the personal information we collect through the Rewards Program, we do benefit financially from the Rewards Program.\nFor example, although we may lose immediate revenue when a member uses a discount, the positive experience may lead to an overall increase in visits to our restaurants.</p>\n<p>Calculating the actual value that Chipotle generates from those efforts (whether in aggregate or by individual) or a monetary value of the personal information involved is impossible.\nThere are many reasons for this:</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nFirst, the information is of no monetary value by itself, as Chipotle achieves personal information-related benefits only when the information is used in combination with, and in the context of, other aspects of our business such as (1) high-quality marketing efforts, (2) the compelling financial components of our Rewards Program that do not require use of the personal information, such as the ability to earn discounts and rewards, (3) the high quality of our food and service, and (4) the proximity of our restaurants to Rewards Program members.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nSecond, we can\u2019t precisely determine the motivating factors of any specific purchase, or the relative weights of each factor.&nbsp.\nEven if somebody redeems a coupon we sent to the contact information they supplied during Rewards Program registration, we can\u2019t determine whether they would have made the same purchase on the same day even without the coupon.&nbsp.\nIn a lot of households, Tuesday is taco Tuesday \u2013 coupon or not.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nThird, the level of engagement with our uses of personal information varies among Rewards Program members.\nFor example, some members may read a lot of our marketing content, while others have unsubscribed and never see any.\nSome live next door to one of our restaurants, while others are out of delivery range.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nFourth, the dining habits of our Rewards Program members appear to vary significantly.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nFifth, not all members link their purchases to their Rewards Program membership, so we can\u2019t identify all purchases by Rewards Program members, let alone which ones were influenced by their participation in the program.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we estimate that the value of the personal information collected for the Rewards Program would be less than the value the individual receives from their participation in the Reward Program.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Other California Law</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>Subject to certain limitations under California\u2019s Shine the Light law, residents of the State of California may contact us as described at the end of this Privacy Policy to request a list of third parties to whom

questions concerning the construction, validity, interpretation, and enforceability of these Terms, or the rights and obligations of you or Chipotle in connection with your use of the Services or your Submitted Content, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Colorado, without giving effect to the conflict of laws rules thereof.</p>\nDISPUTE RESOLUTION, ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\n<p>You agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen or may arise relating in any way to or arising out of these Terms will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Dispute Resolution section.\nPLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.\nIT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW CLAIMS YOU AND WE HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.</p>\n<p>You agree that whenever you have a disagreement with Chipotle arising out of, connected to, or in any way related to these Terms, you will send a written notice to Chipotle (\u201cDemand\u201d).\nYou agree that the requirements of this Dispute Resolution section will apply even to disagreements that may have arisen before you accepted these Terms.\nYou must send the Demand to the following address (the \u201cNotice Address\u201d): Legal Department, Chipotle Mexican Grill c/o CMG Strategy Co., LLC,&nbsp;610&nbsp;Newport&nbsp;Center Dr., Suite 1300,&nbsp;Newport&nbsp;Beach, CA 92660.\nYou agree that you will not take any legal action, including filing a lawsuit or demanding arbitration, until 20 business days after you send a Demand.\nIf the disagreement stated in the Demand is not resolved to your satisfaction within 10 business days after it is received, and you intend on taking legal action, you agree that you will file a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d).\nThis arbitration provision limits the ability of you and Chipotle to litigate claims in court and you and Chipotle each agree to waive your respective rights to a jury trial or a state or federal judge.\nThere is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.\nHowever, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow these Terms as a court would.\nYou agree that you will not file any lawsuit against Chipotle in any state or federal court.\nYou agree that if you do sue in state or federal court, and Chipotle brings a successful motion to compel arbitration, you must pay all fees and costs incurred by Chipotle in court, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\nFor any such filing of a demand for arbitration, you must effect proper service under the rules of the Arbitrator and notice to the Notice Address may not be sufficient.\nIf, for any reason, the American Arbitration Association is unable to conduct the arbitration, you may file your case with any national arbitration company.\nThe Arbitrator shall apply the AAA Consumer-Related Disputes Supplementary Procedure effective September 15, 2005 (as may be amended) and as modified by the agreement to arbitrate in this Dispute Resolution section.\nYou agree that the Arbitrator will have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute you have with Chipotle.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act allows for the enforcement of arbitration agreements and governs the interpretation and enforcement of the agreement to arbitrate.</p>\n<p>You agree that you will not file a class action or collective action against Chipotle, and that you will not participate in a class action or collective action against them.\nYou agree that you will not join your claims to those of any other person.\nNotwithstanding any other provision in these Terms, if this class action waiver is invalidated, then the agreement to arbitrate is null and void, as though it were never entered into, and any arbitration dispute at that time will be dismissed without prejudice and may be refiled in a court.\nUnder no circumstances do you or Chipotle agree to class or collective procedures in arbitration or the joinder of claims in arbitration.\nChipotle agrees that we will submit all disputes with you to arbitration before the Arbitrator.</p>\nMISCELLANEOUS\n<p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Chipotle and govern your use of the Services and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals whether electronic, oral or written, between you and Chipotle with respect to the Services.\nBoth you and Chipotle acknowledge and agree that no partnership is formed and neither you nor Chipotle has the power or the authority to obligate or bind the other.</p>\n<p>The failure of Chipotle to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.\nIf any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties\u2019 original intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms shall remain in full force and effect.</p>\n<p>The failure of Chipotle to comply with these Terms because of an act of God, war, fire, riot, terrorism, earthquake, actions of federal, state, or local governmental authorities, or for any other reason beyond the reasonable control of Chipotle shall not be deemed a breach of this agreement.\nIf Chipotle fails to act with respect to your breach or anyone else\u2019s breach on any occasion, Chipotle is not waiving its right to act with respect to future or similar breaches.</p>\n<p>The headings in these Terms are for your convenience and reference.\nThese headings do not limit or affect this agreement.</p>\n<p>If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>\nBINDING AGREEMENT\n<p>These Terms constitute a binding agreement between you and Chipotle, and are accepted by you upon your use of the Services.\nThis agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Chipotle regarding the use of the Services and the features therein and supersedes and replaces any prior agreements between you and Chipotle regarding the use of the Services.\nBy using the Services, you represent that you are capable of entering into a binding agreement, and that you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p> ", "created_at": "2022-12-02 23:34:40.647377", "updated_at":
