Information\").</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We may use cookies, web beacons, tokens or similar technologies (collectively referred to as \u201cTracking Technologies\u201d) on the Sites.\n\"Cookies\" are text files that help store user preferences and activity.\n\u201cWeb beacons\u201d (also known as image tags, gif or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses.\n\u201cTokens\u201d are unique persistent identifiers that are generated and sent from a server to a user\u2019s device to identify an interaction session, such as the authentication for a user\u2019s cable provider service, and which are usually stored as an HTTP cookie.\nThe Site and/or third parties may use Tracking Technologies

use of the Site through these Tracking Technologies and Identifiers and that we may use in the emails we send to you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While none of our Sites track our users for behavioral advertising purposes we feel it is important for our users to be aware of their choices when it comes to their online privacy.\nClick&nbsp;<strong>here</strong>&nbsp;for more information about online behavioral advertising.\nWorld of Neopia does not use any behaviorally target advertising on our sites.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our Third Party Advertising Service Providers (as defined in Section D)

themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device if you choose to have Tracking Technologies enabled in your browser (or, for Flash cookies, if you have not removed them) and/or they may otherwise have access to other information about you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You have a number of options with respect to the Tracking Technologies set by the Sites.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may

warnings.\nThis is done through your browser on the device you use to access the Sites.\nAdditional information on warnings and removal of warnings may be available through your browser\u2019s support feature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please be aware that certain areas and features of the Sites can only be accessed in conjunction with Tracking Technologies, and that disabling Tracking Technologies

third parties who may collect, use or disclose cookie information, IP addresses or other identifiers from devices and/or browsers of users who visit the Sites..</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Sites use a variety of third-party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers, and other third-party service providers (collectively, \u201cThird Party Advertising Service Providers\u201d) to, for example, serve advertisements on the Sites, facilitate targeting of advertisements, or measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on the Sites (\u201cTargeting Services\u201d) in an aggregate and anonymous form.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These Third Party Advertising Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Sites except to the extent necessary to provide services to the Sites.\nThe Third Party Advertising Service Providers, as well as advertisers, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your device if you choose to have Tracking Technologies enabled in your browser (or, for Flash cookies, if you have not removed them) and/or they may otherwise have access to Other Information about you.\nIn addition, Third Party Advertising Service Providers may collect aggregate log data separately and independently from what the Sites collect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You should be aware that different rules might apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your information by third parties in connection with their advertisements, promotions and other websites you encounter on the internet.\nThe use of such technology by these third parties is within their control and not the Sites.\nEven if we have a relationship with the third party, we do not control those sites or their policies and practices regarding your information and those sites may use the information they collect from you consistent with their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review.\nWe are not responsible for any action or omission by the third parties in relation to the collection, use or disclosure of cookie information, IP addresses, identifiers or other personal information collected by the third party.\nWe encourage you to research and direct any of your questions in this regard to these third parties.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these Providers and Advertisers may participate in the Network&nbsp;<strong>Advertising Initiative\u2019s Opt-Out Tool</strong>&nbsp;and/or the&nbsp;<strong>Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising</strong>.\nPlease click on the links to these tools to learn more about your choices.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please note the following with respect to opting out of Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Advertising Service Providers and advertisers:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>The opt-out tools discussed above are \u201ccookie based.\u201d&nbsp;</strong>This means that the tools rely on cookies to remember your choices with respect to the use of your information by the parties that offer you those choices.\nIf you opt-out but then use the controls in your browser to delete all Tracking Technologies, you may have to opt-out again, a second time, in order to re-establish your opt-out preferences.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Opt-outs are browser-specific.</strong>&nbsp;This means, for example, that if you opt out while using a particular internet browser, this choice will not affect the collection of information collected by Tracking Technologies when you use another internet browser on the same device.\nIt also means that opting out on one device will not affect the collection of information by Tracking Technologies on other devices you may use to access the Sites.</li>\n<li>Opting-out of, deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Third Party Advertising Service Providers\u2019 Tracking Technologies does not mean that you will no longer receive online ads.\nOpting-out of, deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Third Party Advertising Service Providers\u2019 Tracking Technologies only means that such ads will no longer be tailored to your specific viewing habits or interests, but you will continue to see ads on the Sites.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.\nSome web browsers may transmit \"do-not-track\" signals to the websites with which the browser communicates.\nBecause of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.\nThere currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>D.\nContests and Sweepstakes:&nbsp;</strong>The Sites may offer online contests and sweepstakes.\nTo enter these contests and sweepstakes, you may be required to provide your first name and email address and/or additional information required for the management of the contest or sweepstakes.\nFor children under the age of 13, we may collect the child\u2019s e-mail address to enter the child in the contest or sweepstakes, store such child\u2019s email address for the duration of the sweepstakes, and use it for notification if he or she is the winner&nbsp;following the child\u2019s parent or guardian\u2019s consent.\nFor contests or sweepstakes on such sites, we may ask for the email address of the child's parent or guardian to inform the parent or guardian of his or her child's entry and give the parent or guardian the option to have the child's entry deleted.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>E.\nElectronic Postcards and Messages:</strong>\n<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The Sites may provide users the opportunity to send electronic postcards and \u201cwish lists\u201d of items they want to family or friends, which means we will send, on the user\u2019s behalf, email messages to family and/or friends.\nTo do so, users must provide the email address of the recipient of such electronic postcards or email messages.\nUsers must only provide email addresses of people who they know would be happy to receive such electronic postcards or email messages.\nEmail addresses provided to us for this purpose are used solely to send the requested postcard or email message and are anonymized and deleted from our system once the postcard or message is sent.\nIn some cases, we may offer users an incentive (e.g., points to be used in an online game) for referring information about products to the user's family or friends.\nIn such cases, we will comply with all applicable legal requirements.\nPlease note that this feature may not be available to users in certain regions or countries.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>F.\nElectronic Newsletters:</strong>\n<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Users can provide their email addresses to receive email newsletters and promotions from World of Neopia' companies, and our business partners.\nUsers may change their preferences regarding emails at any time through the unsubscribe link in the newsletters or, for certain Sites, by logging into and changing the preferences for their account.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>G.\nInteractive Features and Services:</strong>\n<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Some of the Sites may offer interactive features and services, such as message boards, chat rooms, electronic mail services, comment boxes, messaging

access.\nThe Sites conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions.\nWe limit access to user\u2019s information to employees and contractors who are authorized for the proper handling of such information, and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes.\nWe also take reasonable steps to help make sure our third-party agents protect the security of your personal information.\nHowever, as with most internet sites or services, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully access such personal information through a number of means despite our efforts.</p>\n<p>Information collected at the Sites will not be stored for longer than is necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or to otherwise meet legal requirements.</p> V.\nACCESSING AND CORRECTING INFORMATION.\nTERMINATION OF WIRELESS SERVICES.\n<p>\n<strong>A.\nReviewing Your Information</strong>\n<br>You have the right

for the most recent wireless service you received.\nAny of these words followed by the word \"ALL\" in the user's termination request will cancel all of the user's registered wireless services with the Sites.\nIf you unsubscribe from one or all of wireless service(s) via your wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel your previous opt-in.</p> VI.\nONLINE SAFETY.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Involvement in your family\u2019s online lives is the most important safety tool available.\nWe encourage you to use the following guidelines as starting point for discussing safety and privacy concerns with your child:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Never give out your personal information online.<br>Would you tell a stranger who you are and where you live? No way! Well chatting online is just like talking to strangers (except online, you can't even SEE them!) SO never give anyone your whole name, address or phone number on the internet, in email, in an instant message or in a chat room.\nIf you know your Social Security Number or credit card or bank account number, definitely do not give those out either.\nAnd while you're at it, don't post anyone else's information, and be careful telling other people online the name of your school, sports team or favorite hang out.\nThat information is yours and we want to keep it that way.</li>\n<li>Don't use your real name in your screen name.<br>And while you're at it, don't include your age or your hometown either.\nYou may think your screen name is super creative, but if it says too much about you, people you don't know can find out more about you then you think.</li>\n<li>Keep your password to yourself.<br>Giving out your password is like giving your brother or sister the key to your room.\nDo you want them in there checking out all of your stuff whenever they feel like it? NO way! Same goes for your personal stuff online.</li>\n<li>Read the rules and privacy options for websites that let you connect with others online.<br>We mean really read 'em.\nSome sites only let certain people who have registered read posts, chat and look at other users' webpages.\nOthers let anyone who comes to the site check out everything.\nNo matter which kind of site you're on, find out if you can restrict your information so that it can only be seen by the people you choose.</li>\n<li>Only share stuff online that you don't mind anyone seeing.<br>Anyone can use the internet and most people do.\nThat includes your parents, your friends' parents, your teachers, and the creepy guy in the back of math class who never raises his hand.\nIf you want private info to stay private, don't post it online.</li>\n<li>Once you post something online, it stays online.<br>You can delete something you've typed or posted from a site, but people can get to older versions of that site where your info still exists.\nIf you're not sure you should say something on the internet, you probably shouldn't.</li>\n<li>Don't download anything if you don't know who it's from.<br>Downloads can give your computer viruses, mess up your applications and even cause your email server to send messages with your name on them to people you don't know.\nYou can set the preferences on your computer to warn you about downloads before it opens them.\nSo stop and think before you download anything you're not sure of.\nYou don't know where that thing has been.</li>\n<li>Keep your online friendships online.<br>There are all kinds of cool people using the internet.\nBut there's no way of keeping the creeps out.\nIf someone you met online wants to meet you in person, tell an adult.\nIf you do end up meeting face to face bring a parent or another close adult with you.</li>\n<li>And finally, if you feel unsafe, tell an adult.<br>If someone or something online is making you uncomfortable, tell a parent, a teacher or another adult you trust.\nAsk the adult to help you report the incident to the website, or if necessary to the police.\nYour actions might end up helping a lot of other people too.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> VII.\nLINKS TO THIRD PARTIES.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The websites that comprise the Sites may contain links to other sites, including those of sponsors, advertisers, social networking platforms, and survey companies.\nThese other websites are governed by their own privacy policies or information collection practices, which may be substantially different from ours.\nWe encourage users to other websites to review the privacy policies and information collection practices of those websites.</p> VIII.\nYOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our users who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.\nIf at any time you wish to opt out of having your personal information shared with third parties and/or receiving information from us (via e-mail or postal mail) about new products, services, or promotions, you can do so.\nYou may contact us at World of Neopia, Inc.,&nbsp;Whitehall Chambers, 2nd Floor Whitehall House, 238 North Church Street, George Town, PO Box 31489, KY1-1206, Cayman Islands.\nYou can also contact us by e-mailing us at&nbsp;<strong>privacy</strong>\n<strong>@neopets.com</strong>.\nPlease indicate what publications or services you no longer wish to receive so that we may better address your request.</p>\n<p>This document is the sole statement of the Sites' Privacy Policy and no summary, restatement or other version thereof, or other privacy statement or policy, in any form, including, without limitation, machine-generated, is valid.\nIn interpreting this Agreement, the English version governs the interpretation and meaning of the obligation set forth herein.\nTo the extent there is an ambiguity or conflict with the Privacy Policy in other languages, the Privacy Policy in English governs.</p> IX.\nGDPR (for European Economic Area Customers) <p>We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise.\nData protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of the World of Neopia.\nThe use of the internet pages of the World of Neopia is possible without any indication of personal data.\nHowever, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our Sites, processing of personal data could become necessary.\nIf the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we will obtain consent from the data subject.</p>\n<p>The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the World of Neopia.\nBy means of this data protection declaration, we would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process.\nFurthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.</p>\n<p>As the controller, the World of Neopia has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through the Sites.\nHowever, internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed.\nFor this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g., by telephone.</p> 1.\nDefinitions <p>The data protection declaration of the World of Neopia is based on the terms used under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nOur data protection declaration should be legible and understandable for the general public, as well as our customers and business partners.\nTo ensure this, we would like to first explain the terminology used.</p>\n<p>In this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>a) Personal data</strong>\n<br>Personal data means any information relating to an

otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>d) Restriction of processing</strong>\n<br>Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>e) Profiling</strong>\n<br>Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location, movements, or generally have a legal impact on the data subject.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>f) Pseudonymisation</strong>\n<br>Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>g) Controller or controller responsible for the processing</strong>\n<br>Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.\nwhere the purposes and means

authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients.\nthe processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>j) Third party</strong>\n<br>Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>k) Consent</strong>\n<br>Consent of the data subject is any voluntarily given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the collection or processing of personal data relating to him or her.</li>\n</ul> 2.\nName and Address of the controller <p>Controller for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), other data protection laws applicable in Member states of the European Union and other provisions related to data protection is:</p>\n<p>World of Neopia, Inc.</p>\n<p>Whitehall Chambers, 2nd Floor Whitehall House,</p>\n<p>238 North Church Street,</p>\n<p>George Town, PO Box 31498,</p>\n<p>KY1-1206,</p>\n<p>Cayman Islands&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Email: privacy@neopets.com</p>\n<p>Website: www.neopets.com</p> 3.\nCookies <p>The Internet pages of the World of Neopia uses cookies.\nCookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an internet browser.</p>\n<p>Many internet sites and servers use cookies.\nMany cookies contain a so-called cookie ID.\nA cookie ID is a unique identifier for the cookie.\nIt consists of a character string through which internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific internet browser in which the cookie was stored.\nThis allows visited internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the data subject from other internet browsers that contain other cookies.\nA specific internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.</p>\n<p>Through the use of cookies, the World of Neopia can provide the users of the Sites with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.</p>\n<p>By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our Sites can be optimized with the user in mind.\nThe purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our Sites.\nThe website user that uses cookies, e.g., does not have to enter access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user's computer system.\nAnother example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop.\nThe online store remembers the articles that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.</p>\n<p>The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our Sites by means of a corresponding setting of the internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.\nFurthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an internet browser or other software programs.\nThis is possible in all internet browsers.\nIf the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be entirely available.</p> 4.\nCollection of general data and information <p>The website of the World of Neopia collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website.\nThis general data and information are stored in the server log files.\nThe general data collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Site, (6) an internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.</p>\n<p>When using these general data and information, the World of Neopia does not draw any conclusions about the data subject.\nRather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our Sites correctly, (2) optimize the content of our Sites as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack.\nTherefore, the World of Neopia analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process.\nThe anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.</p> 5.\nRegistration on our website <p>The data subject has the possibility to register on the website of the controller with the indication of personal data.\nWhich personal data are transmitted to the controller is determined by the respective input mask used for the registration.\nThe personal data entered by the data subject are collected and stored exclusively for the purposes prescribed in Part I of the Privacy Policy by the controller.\nThe controller may request transfer from the data subject to one or more processors (e.g., a parcel service) that also uses the data subject\u2019s personal data for a purpose which is attributable the purpose or one of the lawful bases of processing.</p>\n<p>By registering on the website of the controller, the IP address-assigned by the internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject-date, and time of the registration are also stored.\nThe storage of this data takes place against the background that this is the only way to prevent the misuse of our services, and, if necessary, to make it possible to investigate committed offenses.\nInsofar, the storage of this data is necessary to secure the controller.\nThis data is not passed on to third parties unless there is a statutory obligation to pass on the data, or if the transfer serves the aim of criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p>The registration of the data subject, with the voluntary provision of personal data, is intended to enable the controller to offer the data subject contents or services that may only be offered to registered users due to the nature of the matter in question.\nRegistered persons are free to correct the personal data specified during the registration at any time, or to have them completely deleted from the data stock of the controller.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> 6.\nSubscription to our newsletters <p>On the website of the World of Neopia, users are given the opportunity to subscribe to our enterprise's newsletter.\nThe input mask used for this purpose determines what personal data is transmitted, as well as when the newsletter is ordered from the controller.</p>\n<p>The World of Neopia informs its customers and business partners regularly by means of a newsletter about enterprise offers.\nOur newsletter may only be received by the data subject if (1) the data subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the data subject registers and consents for the newsletter shipping.\nA confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address registered by a data subject for the first time for newsletter shipping, for legal reasons, in the double opt-in procedure.\nThis confirmation e-mail is used to prove whether the owner of the e-mail address as the data subject is authorized to receive the newsletter.</p>\n<p>During the registration for the newsletter, we also store the IP address of the computer system assigned by the internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject at the time of the registration, as well as the date and time of the registration.\nThe collection of this data is necessary in order to understand the (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data subject at a later date, and it therefore serves the aim of the legal protection of the controller.</p>\n<p>The personal data collected as part of a registration for the newsletter will only be used to send our newsletter.\nIn addition, subscribers to the newsletter may be informed by e-mail, as long as this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or a registration in question, as this could be the case in the event of modifications to the newsletter offer, or in the event of a change in technical circumstances.\nThere will be no transfer of personal data collected by the newsletter service to third parties.\nThe subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by the data subject at any time.\nThe consent to the storage of personal data, which the data subject has given for shipping the newsletter, may be revoked at any time.\nFor the purpose of revocation of consent, a corresponding link is found in each newsletter.\nData subjects may unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time directly on the website of the controller, or to communicate this to the controller in a different way.</p> 7.\nNewsletter-Tracking <p>The newsletter of the World of Neopia contains so-called tracking pixels.\nA tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in such e-mails, which are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and analysis.\nThis allows a statistical analysis of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns.\nBased on the embedded tracking pixel, the World of Neopia may see if and when an e-mail was opened by a data subject, and which links in the e-mail were called up by data subjects.</p>\n<p>Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored and analyzed by the controller in order to optimize the shipping of the newsletter, as well as to adapt the content of future newsletters even better to the interests of the data subject.\nThese personal data will not be passed on to third parties.\nData subjects are at any time entitled to revoke the respective separate declaration of consent issued by means of the double-opt-in procedure.\nAfter a revocation, these personal data will be deleted by the controller.\nThe World of Neopia automatically regards a withdrawal from the receipt of the newsletter as a revocation.</p> 8.\nComments function in the blog on the website <p>The World of Neopia offers users the possibility to leave individual comments on individual blog contributions on a blog, which is on the website of the controller.\nA blog is a web-based, publicly-accessible portal, through which one or more people called bloggers or web-bloggers may post articles or write down thoughts in so-called blogposts.\nBlogposts may usually be commented on by third parties.</p>\n<p>If a data subject leaves a comment on the blog published on this website, the comments made by the data subject are also stored and published, as well as information on the date of the commentary and on the user's (pseudonym) chosen by the data subject.\nIn addition, the IP address assigned by the internet service provider (ISP) to the data subject is also logged.\nThis storage of the IP address takes place for security reasons, and in case the data subject violates the rights of third parties, or posts illegal content through a given comment.\nThe storage of these personal data is, therefore, in the own interest of the data controller, so that he can exculpate in the event of an infringement.\nThis collected personal data will not be passed to third parties, unless such a transfer is required by law or serves the aim of the defense of the data controller.</p> 9.\nSubscription to comments in the blog on the website <p>The comments made in the blog of the World of Neopia may be subscribed to by third parties.\nIn particular, there is the possibility that a commenter subscribes to the comments following his comments on a particular blog post.</p>\n<p>If a data subject decides to subscribe to the option, the controller will send an automatic confirmation e-mail to check the double opt-in procedure as to whether the owner of the specified e-mail address decided in favor of this option.\nThe option to subscribe to comments may be terminated at any time by the data subject.</p> 10.\nRoutine erasure and blocking of personal data <p>The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this allowed under the GDPR.</p>\n<p>If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by GDPR expires, the personal data are routinely pseudonymized or erased in accordance with legal requirements.</p> 11.\nRights of the data subject <ul>\n<li>\n<strong>a) Right of confirmation</strong>\n<br>Each data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being stored and processed.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<strong>b) Right of access</strong>\n<br>Each data subject shall

recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organisations;</li>\n<li>where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;</li>\n<li>the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of

such processing for the data subject.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Furthermore, the data subject shall have a right to obtain information as to whether personal data are transferred to a third party, or to an international organisation.\nWhere this is the case, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer.<br>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<strong>c) Right to rectification</strong>\n<br>Each data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning him or her.\nTaking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.<br>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<strong>d) Right to erasure (Right to be forgotten)</strong>\n<br>Each data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not necessary: <ul>\n<li>Personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.</li>\n<li>The data subject withdraws consent to which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing.</li>\n<li>The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the GDPR.</li>\n<li>The personal data has been unlawfully processed.</li>\n<li>The personal data must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject.</li>\n<li>The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1) of

may, at any time, contact any our&nbsp;Data Protection Officer.\nThe Data Protection Officer shall promptly ensure that the erasure request is complied with immediately.<br>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Where the controller has made personal data public and is obliged pursuant to Article 17(1) to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform other controllers processing the personal data that the data subject has requested erasure by such controllers of any links to, or

data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</li>\n<li>The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing of personal data stored by the World of Neopia, he or she may at any time contact our Data Protection Officer.\nOur Data Protection Officer will arrange the restriction of the processing.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<strong>f) Right to data portability</strong>\n<br>Each data subject shall

of Neopia shall no longer process the personal data in the event of the objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.<br>If the World of Neopia processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing.\nThis applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.\nIf

22.\nPayment Method: Data protection provisions about the use of PayPal as a payment processor <p>On this website, the controller has integrated components of PayPal.\nPayPal is an online payment service provider.\nPayments are processed via so-called PayPal accounts, which represent virtual private or business accounts.\nPayPal is also able to process virtual payments through credit cards when a user does not have a PayPal account.\nA PayPal account is managed via an e-mail address, which is why there are no classic account numbers.\nPayPal makes it possible to trigger online payments to third parties or to receive payments.\nPayPal also accepts trustee functions and offers buyer protection services.</p>\n<p>The European operating company of PayPal is PayPal (Europe) S.\u00e0.r.l.\n&amp.\nCie.\nS.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, 2449 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.</p>\n<p>If the data subject chooses \"PayPal\" as the payment option in the online shop during the ordering process, we automatically transmit the data of the data subject to PayPal.\nBy selecting this payment option, the data subject agrees to the transfer of personal data required for payment processing.</p>\n<p>The personal data transmitted to PayPal is usually first name, last name, address, email address, IP address, telephone number, mobile phone number, credit or debit card number, expiry date of credit or debit card, or other data necessary for payment processing.\nThe processing of the purchase contract also requires such personal data, which are in connection with the respective order.</p>\n<p>The transmission of the data is aimed at payment processing and fraud prevention.\nThe controller will transfer personal data to PayPal, in particular, if a legitimate interest in the transmission is given.&nbsp;The personal data exchanged between PayPal and the controller for the processing of the data will be transmitted by PayPal to economic credit agencies.\nThis transmission is intended for identity and creditworthiness checks.</p>\n<p>PayPal will, if necessary, pass on personal data to affiliates and service providers or subcontractors to the extent that this is necessary to fulfill contractual obligations or for data to be processed in the order.</p>\n<p>The data subject has the possibility to revoke consent for the handling of personal data at any time from PayPal.\nA revocation shall not have any effect on personal data which must be processed, used or transmitted in accordance with (contractual) payment processing.</p>\n<p>The applicable data protection provisions of PayPal may be retrieved under https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full.</p> 23.\nLegal basis for the processing <p>Art.\n6(1) lit.\na GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose.\nIf the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit.\nb GDPR.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services.\nIf our company is subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art.\n6(1) lit.\nc GDPR.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.\nThis would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party.\nThen the processing would be based on Art.\n6(1) lit.\nd GDPR.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit.\nf GDPR.\nThis legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.&nbsp;</p> 24.\nProvision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement.\nRequirement necessary to enter into a contract.\nObligation of the data subject to provide the personal data.\npossible consequences of failure to provide such data <p>We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g., tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g., information on the contractual partner).\nSometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us.\nThe data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her.\nThe non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded.\nBefore personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee.\nThe employee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.</p> 25.\nExistence of automated decision-making <p>As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or profiling.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>26.\nInternational&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>Transfers</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is
