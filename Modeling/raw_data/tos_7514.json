BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.\nANY ARBITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.\nCLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.</p>\n<p>You and Life Protect 24/7 agree that any and all claims and disputes arising from or relating in any way to the subject matter of these Terms of Use, your use of the Website, or your and the Life Protect 24/7\u2019s dealings with one another in connection with this Website shall be finally settled and resolved through BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION as described in this section.\nThis agreement to arbitrate is intended to be interpreted broadly.\nThe arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d), as modified by this section.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by Judicial Arbiter Group, Inc.\n(\u201cJAG\u201d) using one arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAG arbitrators in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAG.\nIf JAG is unable or unwilling to arbitrate a dispute, then the dispute may be referred to any other arbitration organization or arbitrator that you and Life Protect 24/7 both agree upon in writing or that is appointed pursuant to section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act.\nFor any claim where the total amount of the award sought is $10,000 or less, the arbitrator, you, and Life Protect 24/7 must abide by the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted solely based on telephone or online appearances and/or written submissions.\nand (b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.\nIf the claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA rules, and the hearing (if any) must take place in Virginia Beach, Virginia.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s ruling is binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.</p>\n<p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration.\nArbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than rules applicable in court, and review by a court is limited.\nNeither you nor Life Protect 24/7 will be able to have a court or jury trial or participate in a class action or class arbitration.\nYou and the Life Protect 24/7 each understand and agree that by agreeing to resolve any dispute through individual arbitration, YOU AND LIFE PROTECT 24/7 ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A COURT OR JURY TRIAL.\nANY DISPUTE SHALL BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, OR ANY SIMILAR PROCEEDING.\nThe arbitrator may not consolidate the claims of multiple parties.</p>\n<p>ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE, OR YOUR AND LIFE PROTECT 24/7\u2019S DEALINGS WITH ONE ANOTHER IN CONNECTION WITH THE WEBSITE MUST BE COMMENCED IN ARBITRATION WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES.\nAFTER THAT ONE (1)-YEAR PERIOD, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>\n<p>You and we agree that all challenges to the validity and applicability of the arbitration provision\u2014i.e.\nwhether a particular claim or dispute is subject to arbitration\u2014shall be determined by the arbitrator.\nNotwithstanding any provision in these terms to the contrary, if the class-action waiver above is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration.\nIf the arbitration provision in this section is found unenforceable or to not apply for a given dispute, then the proceeding must be brought exclusively in the state courts of competent jurisdiction located in Virginia Beach, Virginia or the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Norfolk Division, located in Norfolk, Virginia, as appropriate, and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of each of these courts for the purpose of litigating such claims or disputes, and you still waive your right to a jury trial, waive your right to initiate or proceed in a class or collective action, and remain bound by any and all limitations on liability and damages included in these Terms of Use.\nThis arbitration agreement will survive termination of your use of this Website.\nThis arbitration agreement involves interstate commerce and, therefore, shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1-16 (\u201cFAA\u201d), and not by state law.\nInformation on AAA and how to start arbitration can be found at www.adr.org or by calling 800-778-7879.\nIf you wish to initiate arbitration against Life Protect 24/7, you must send notice to Life Protect 24/7 to the address below.</p>\n<p>If you wish to opt-out of the agreement to arbitrate, within 30 (thirty) days of when you first use the Website or submit through the Website a request for information, you must send
