and page views, video plays (if videos are hosted by WordPress.com), outbound link clicks, referring URLs and search engine terms, and country.\nWhen this module is enabled, Jetpack also tracks performance on each page load that includes the Javascript file used for tracking stats.\nThis is exclusively for aggregate performance tracking across Jetpack sites in order to make sure that our plugin and code is not causing performance issues.\nThis includes the tracking of page load times and resource loading duration (image files, Javascript files, CSS files, etc.).</p>Subscriptions<p>\n<strong>Data Used:</strong> To initiate and process subscriptions, the following information is used: subscriber\u2019s email address and the ID of the post or comment

request headers, the IP address from which the subscribing user is viewing the page, and the URI which was given in order to access the page (<code>REQUEST_URI</code> and <code>DOCUMENT_URI</code>).\nThis server data used for the exclusive purpose of monitoring and preventing abuse and spam.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Activity Tracked:</strong> Functionality cookies are set for a duration of <strong>347 days</strong> to remember a visitor\u2019s blog and post subscription choices if, in fact, they have an active subscription.</p>Who we share your data with<p>We do not share
